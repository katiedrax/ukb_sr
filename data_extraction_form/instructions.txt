# Preregistration: data extraction from epidemiology articles

## Time of writing
Data extraction has not yet begun. 
The first draft of the data extraction form has been piloted on one study by three people.

## Procedure

The following procedure will be conducted for all articles classified as 'observational epidemiology'

1. One person (KD) will identify and exclude retracted articles by assessing the notices attached to the online version of the article. 
2. One person (KD) will identify any articles with supplementary material which cannot be accessed via the University of Bristol subscriptions. If an article has inaccessible supplementary material it will be excluded(?)
3. The items in Table 1 will be extracted manually by one person (KD) or automatically by a bibliographic manager.
4.  The articles will be randomly assigned to two people (MG, KD, BW or RR) who will independently complete the data extraction form for each article. This means each person will extract data from 89 articles. Any conflicts will be discussed by the two extractors and resolved by mutual consent if possible. If not resolved after discussion RR or MM will assign the category.

  

*Table 1. Methods for extracting article's meta-data*

| **Item**  | **Definition** | **Method of extraction** |
|---|---|---|
|  Article ID(s) of related articles |Article IDs of articles that contain similar analyses.| Examine articles with same first author, last author and UK Biobank application number.|
| Citation| | Bibliographic|
| Publication date| | Bibliographic|
| Authors | |
|Journal| |
|Volume| |
|Issue| |
|Open Access| | (1) search for article on open access button (https://openaccessbutton.org/) and follow the link on non-university network  (2) if no on open access button check if there are links on google scholar|
|Countries of corresponding, first & last author | | Extract country of author's affiliations|
|UK Biobank Application number |Study's approved UK Biobank data application number (if present)| (1) search article for all these terms:  'application' , 'approv' , 'number' , 'Resource' (2) if not found examine any strings of numbers in article|
| Author keywords | | (1)extract from page 1 (2) if not on page 1 search article for 'keywords' |
| Journal endorsement | Journal's endorsement of STROBE before publication| (1) extract references to STROBE from the journal's ‘instructions/guide for authors’ published six months (?) before article publication date (?)|
| Journal impact factor |  | Retrieve the impact factor of the journal for year of publication from Web of Science's  Journal Citation Reports (JCR) (?)|
| Corresponding author address|| Bibliographic (if missing (1)extract from page 1 (2) if not on page 1 search article for 'corresponding', '@')|
| Conflicts of interest statement || (1) search article material for all these terms: 'competing', 'interest' ,'conflict' , 'disclosure' (2) if not found examine article for similar terms (3) if present  extract conflicts of interest statements|
| Classification | Classification (MR, epi or other) as assigned by KD, BW and RR in Rayyan | Rayyan|
| Article vs application | Extent to which the article is aligned with the approved UKB application | (1) examine the overlap between application and article keywords and whether there are clear differences between the aims stated in the approved UK Biobank data application and the article (? if we do this should we be looking at registration discrepancies too?)|
 
## **Missing items**  

We will not attempt to retrieve any missing items in the data extraction form, this is to give an accurate assessment of the version of record and to avoid exhausting the extractors resources.
 

## Questions

(?) what about starred items ("\*Give information separately for cases and controls in case-control studies and, if applicable, for exposed and unexposed groups in cohort and cross-sectional studies.")  
   
(?)what if there are multiple studies? would it be authors fully reporting this information for ALL studies, etc?
