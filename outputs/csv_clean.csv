OBJECTIVE: To estimate reductions in life expectancy associated with cardiometabolic multimorbidity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Age- and sex-adjusted mortality rates and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using individual participant data from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (689,300 participants; 91 cohorts; years of baseline surveys: 1960-2007; latest mortality follow-up: April 2013; 128,843 deaths). The HRs from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration were compared with those from the UK Biobank (499,808 participants; years of baseline surveys: 2006-2010; latest mortality follow-up: November 2013; 7995 deaths). Cumulative survival was estimated by applying calculated age-specific HRs for mortality to contemporary US age-specific death rates. EXPOSURES: A history of 2 or more of the following: diabetes mellitus, stroke, myocardial infarction (MI). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause mortality and estimated reductions in life expectancy. RESULTS: In participants in the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration without a history of diabetes, stroke, or MI at baseline (reference group), the all-cause mortality rate adjusted to the age of 60 years was 6.8 per 1000 person-years. Mortality rates per 1000 person-years were 15.6 in participants with a history of diabetes, 16.1 in those with stroke, 16.8 in those with MI, 32.0 in those with both diabetes and MI, 32.5 in those with both diabetes and stroke, 32.8 in those with both stroke and MI, and 59.5 in those with diabetes, stroke, and MI. Compared with the reference group, the HRs for all-cause mortality were 1.9 (95% CI, 1.8-2.0) in participants with a history of diabetes, 2.1 (95% CI, 2.0-2.2) in those with stroke, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.9-2.2) in those with MI, 3.7 (95% CI, 3.3-4.1) in those with both diabetes and MI, 3.8 (95% CI, 3.5-4.2) in those with both diabetes and stroke, 3.5 (95% CI, 3.1-4.0) in those with both stroke and MI, and 6.9 (95% CI, 5.7-8.3) in those with diabetes, stroke, and MI. The HRs from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration were similar to those from the more recently recruited UK Biobank. The HRs were little changed after further adjustment for markers of established intermediate pathways (eg, levels of lipids and blood pressure) and lifestyle factors (eg, smoking, diet). At the age of 60 years, a history of any 2 of these conditions was associated with 12 years of reduced life expectancy and a history of all 3 of these conditions was associated with 15 years of reduced life expectancy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mortality associated with a history of diabetes, stroke, or MI was similar for each condition. Because any combination of these conditions was associated with multiplicative mortality risk, life expectancy was substantially lower in people with multimorbidity.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26151266","10.1001/jama.2015.7008"

Whether these associations represent causal relationships remains uncertain. Objective: To test the association of a polygenic risk score for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) adjusted for body mass index (BMI), a measure of abdominal adiposity, with type 2 diabetes and CHD through the potential intermediates of blood lipids, blood pressure, and glycemic phenotypes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A polygenic risk score for WHR adjusted for BMI, a measure of genetic predisposition to abdominal adiposity, was constructed with 48 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The association of this score with cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes, and CHD was tested in a mendelian randomization analysis that combined case-control and cross-sectional data sets. Estimates for cardiometabolic traits were based on a combined data set consisting of summary results from 4 genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 to 2015, including up to 322154 participants, as well as individual-level, cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank collected from 2007-2011, including 111986 individuals. Estimates for type 2 diabetes and CHD were derived from summary statistics of 2 separate genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 to 2015 and including 149821 individuals and 184305 individuals, respectively, combined with individual-level data from the UK Biobank. Exposures: Genetic predisposition to increased WHR adjusted for BMI. Main Outcomes and Measures: Type 2 diabetes and CHD. Results: Among 111986 individuals in the UK Biobank, the mean age was 57 (SD, 8) years, 58845 participants (52.5%) were women, and mean WHR was 0.875. Analysis of summary-level genome-wide association study results and individual-level UK Biobank data demonstrated that a 1-SD increase in WHR adjusted for BMI mediated by the polygenic risk score was associated with 27-mg/dL higher triglyceride levels, 4.1-mg/dL higher 2-hour glucose levels, and 2.1-mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (each P < .001). A 1-SD genetic increase in WHR adjusted for BMI was also associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.57-2.00]; absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years, 6.0 [95% CI, CI, 4.4-7.8]; number of participants with type 2 diabetes outcome, 40530) and CHD (odds ratio, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.32-1.62]; absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.3-2.4]; number of participants with CHD outcome, 66440). Conclusions and Relevance: A genetic predisposition to higher waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. These results provide evidence supportive of a causal association between abdominal adiposity and these outcomes.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28196256","10.1001/jama.2016.21042"

Young individuals with AF have a strong genetic association with the disease, but the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Objective: To perform large-scale whole-genome sequencing to identify genetic variants related to AF. Design, Setting, and Participants: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine Program includes longitudinal and cohort studies that underwent high-depth whole-genome sequencing between 2014 and 2017 in 18526 individuals from the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Barbados, and Samoa. This case-control study included 2781 patients with early-onset AF from 9 studies and identified 4959 controls of European ancestry from the remaining participants. Results were replicated in the UK Biobank (346546 participants) and the MyCode Study (42782 participants). Exposures: Loss-of-function (LOF) variants in genes at AF loci and common genetic variation across the whole genome. Main Outcomes and Measures: Early-onset AF (defined as AF onset in persons <66 years of age). Due to multiple testing, the significance threshold for the rare variant analysis was P = 4.55 x 10-3. Results: Among 2781 participants with early-onset AF (the case group), 72.1% were men, and the mean (SD) age of AF onset was 48.7 (10.2) years. Participants underwent whole-genome sequencing at a mean depth of 37.8 fold and mean genome coverage of 99.1%. At least 1 LOF variant in TTN, the gene encoding the sarcomeric protein titin, was present in 2.1% of case participants compared with 1.1% in control participants (odds ratio [OR], 1.76 [95% CI, 1.04-2.97]). The proportion of individuals with early-onset AF who carried a LOF variant in TTN increased with an earlier age of AF onset (P value for trend, 4.92 x 10-4), and 6.5% of individuals with AF onset prior to age 30 carried a TTN LOF variant (OR, 5.94 [95% CI, 2.64-13.35]; P = 1.65 x 10-5). The association between TTN LOF variants and AF was replicated in an independent study of 1582 patients with early-onset AF (cases) and 41200 control participants (OR, 2.16 [95% CI, 1.19-3.92]; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance: In a case-control study, there was a statistically significant association between an LOF variant in the TTN gene and early-onset AF, with the variant present in a small percentage of participants with early-onset AF (the case group). Further research is necessary to understand whether this is a causal relationship.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535219","10.1001/jama.2018.18179"

Whether mechanisms that increase WHR via lower gluteofemoral (hip) or via higher abdominal (waist) fat distribution affect cardiometabolic risk is unknown. Objective: To identify genetic variants associated with higher WHR specifically via lower gluteofemoral or higher abdominal fat distribution and estimate their association with cardiometabolic risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for WHR combined data from the UK Biobank cohort and summary statistics from previous GWAS (data collection: 2006-2018). Specific polygenic scores for higher WHR via lower gluteofemoral or via higher abdominal fat distribution were derived using WHR-associated genetic variants showing specific association with hip or waist circumference. Associations of polygenic scores with outcomes were estimated in 3 population-based cohorts, a case-cohort study, and summary statistics from 6 GWAS (data collection: 1991-2018). Exposures: More than 2.4 million common genetic variants (GWAS); polygenic scores for higher WHR (follow-up analyses). Main Outcomes and Measures: BMI-adjusted WHR and unadjusted WHR (GWAS); compartmental fat mass measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, type 2 diabetes, and coronary disease risk (follow-up analyses). Results: Among 452302 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry, the mean (SD) age was 57 (8) years and the mean (SD) WHR was 0.87 (0.09). In genome-wide analyses, 202 independent genetic variants were associated with higher BMI-adjusted WHR (n = 660648) and unadjusted WHR (n = 663598). In dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry analyses (n = 18330), the hip- and waist-specific polygenic scores for higher WHR were specifically associated with lower gluteofemoral and higher abdominal fat, respectively. In follow-up analyses (n = 636607), both polygenic scores were associated with higher blood pressure and triglyceride levels and higher risk of diabetes (waist-specific score: odds ratio [OR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.34-1.83], absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years [ARI], 4.4 [95% CI, 2.7-6.5], P < .001; hip-specific score: OR, 2.54 [95% CI, 2.17-2.96], ARI, 12.0 [95% CI, 9.1-15.3], P < .001) and coronary disease (waist-specific score: OR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.39-1.84], ARI, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.5-3.3], P < .001; hip-specific score: OR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.53-2.02], ARI, 3.0 [95% CI, 2.1-4.0], P < .001), per 1-SD increase in BMI-adjusted WHR. Conclusions and Relevance: Distinct genetic mechanisms may be linked to gluteofemoral and abdominal fat distribution that are the basis for the calculation of the WHR. These findings may improve risk assessment and treatment of diabetes and coronary disease.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30575882","10.1001/jama.2018.19329"

Objectives: To use UK Biobank data to report causal estimates of the association between BMI and cardiometabolic disease outcomes and traits, such as pulse rate, using mendelian randomization. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional baseline data from a population-based cohort study including 119859 UK Biobank participants with complete phenotypic (medical and sociodemographic) and genetic data. Participants attended 1 of 22 assessment centers across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. The present study was conducted from May 1 to July 11, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and type 2 diabetes were determined at assessment, based on self-report. Blood pressure was measured clinically. Participants self-reported sociodemographic information pertaining to relevant confounders. A polygenic risk score comprising 93 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BMI from previous genome-wide association studies was constructed, and the genetic risk score was applied to derive causal estimates using a mendelian randomization approach. Results: Of the 119859 individuals included in the study, 56 816 (47.4%) were men; mean (SD) age was 56.87 (7.93) years.

Objective: To investigate the association of combined health behaviors and factors within genetic risk groups with coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes as well as to investigate the interactions between genetic risk and lifestyle. Design, Setting, and Participants: The UK Biobank cohort study includes more than 500000 participants aged 40 to 70 years who were recruited from 22 assessment centers across the United Kingdom from 2006 to 2010. A total of 339003 unrelated individuals of white British descent with available genotype and matching genetic data and reported sex were included in this study from the UK Biobank population-based sample. Individuals were included in the analyses of 1 or more new-onset diseases. Data were analyzed from April 2006 to March 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risks of new-onset cardiovascular disease and diabetes associated with genetic risk and combined health behaviors and factors. Genetic risk was categorized as low (quintile 1), intermediate (quintiles 2-4), or high (quintile 5). Within each genetic risk group, the risks of incident events associated with ideal, intermediate, or poor combined health behaviors and factors were investigated and compared with low genetic risk and ideal lifestyle. Results: Of 339003 individuals, 181702 (53.6%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 56.86 (7.99) years. During follow-up, 9771 of 325133 participants (3.0%) developed coronary artery disease, 7095 of 333637 (2.1%) developed atrial fibrillation, 3145 of 332971 (0.9%) developed stroke, 11358 of 234651 (4.8%) developed hypertension, and 4379 of 322014 (1.4%) developed diabetes. Genetic risk and lifestyle were independent predictors of incident events, and there were no interactions for any outcome. Compared with ideal lifestyle in the low genetic risk group, poor lifestyle was associated with a hazard ratio of up to 4.54 (95% CI, 3.72-5.54) for coronary artery disease, 5.41 (95% CI, 4.29-6.81) for atrial fibrillation, 4.68 (95% CI, 3.85-5.69) for hypertension, 2.26 (95% CI, 1.63-3.14) for stroke, and 15.46 (95% CI, 10.82-22.08) for diabetes in the high genetic risk group. Conclusions and Relevance: In this large contemporary population, genetic composition and combined health behaviors and factors had a log-additive effect on the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The relative effects of poor lifestyle were comparable between genetic risk groups. Behavioral lifestyle changes should be encouraged for all through comprehensive, multifactorial approaches, although high-risk individuals may be selected based on the genetic risk.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29955826","10.1001/jamacardio.2018.1717"

Individuals with interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) who are not receiving IL6R blocking therapy have biomarker profiles similar to those treated with IL6R blockers. This gene-drug pair provides an example to test whether associations of IL6R SNPs with a broad range of phenotypes can inform which diseases may benefit from treatment with IL6R blockade. Objective: To determine whether screening for clinical associations with the IL6R SNP in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) using EHR biobank data can identify drug effects from IL6R clinical trials. Design, Setting, and Participants: Diagnosis codes and routine laboratory measurements were extracted from the VA Million Veteran Program (MVP); diagnosis codes were mapped to phenotype groups using published PheWAS methods. A PheWAS was performed by fitting logistic regression models for testing associations of the IL6R SNPs with 1342 phenotype groups and by fitting linear regression models for testing associations of the IL6R SNP with 26 routine laboratory measurements. Significance was reported using a false discovery rate of 0.05 or less. Findings were replicated in 2 independent cohorts using UK Biobank and Vanderbilt University Biobank data. The Million Veteran Program included 332799 US veterans; the UK Biobank, 408455 individuals from the general population of the United Kingdom; and the Vanderbilt University Biobank, 13835 patients from a tertiary care center. Exposures: IL6R SNPs (rs2228145; rs4129267). Main Outcomes and Measures: Phenotypes defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Results: Of the 332799 veterans included in the main cohort, 305 228 (91.7%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 66.1 (13.6) years. The IL6R SNP was most strongly associated with a reduced risk of aortic aneurysm phenotypes (odds ratio, 0.87-0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.93) in the MVP. We observed known off-target effects of IL6R blockade from clinical trials (eg, higher hemoglobin level). The reduced risk for aortic aneurysms among those with the IL6R SNP in the MVP was replicated in the Vanderbilt University Biobank, and the reduced risk for coronary heart disease was replicated in the UK Biobank. Conclusions and Relevance: In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated application of the PheWAS using large EHR biobanks to inform drug effects. The findings of an association of the IL6R SNP with reduced risk for aortic aneurysms correspond with the newest indication for IL6R blockade, giant cell arteritis, of which a major complication is aortic aneurysm.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30090940","10.1001/jamacardio.2018.2287"

However, concerns about coffee, particularly among people with common genetic polymorphisms affecting caffeine metabolism and among those drinking more than 5 cups per day, remain. Objective: To evaluate associations of coffee drinking with mortality by genetic caffeine metabolism score. Design, Setting, and Participants: The UK Biobank is a population-based study that invited approximately 9.2 million individuals from across the United Kingdom to participate. We used baseline demographic, lifestyle, and genetic data form the UK Biobank cohort, with follow-up beginning in 2006 and ending in 2016, to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for coffee intake and mortality, using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. We investigated potential effect modification by caffeine metabolism, defined by a genetic score of previously identified polymorphisms in AHR, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, and POR that have an effect on caffeine metabolism. Of the 502641 participants who consented with baseline data, we included those who were not pregnant and had complete data on coffee intake and smoking status (n = 498134). Exposures: Total, ground, instant, and decaffeinated coffee intake. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause and cause-specific mortality. Results: The mean age of the participants was 57 years (range, 38-73 years); 271 019 (54%) were female, and 387 494 (78%) were coffee drinkers. Over 10 years of follow-up, 14225 deaths occurred. Coffee drinking was inversely associated with all-cause mortality. Using non-coffee drinkers as the reference group, HRs for drinking less than 1, 1, 2 to 3, 4 to 5, 6 to 7, and 8 or more cups per day were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.88-1.01), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.87-0.97), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.93), 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77-0.92), and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.77-0.95), respectively. Similar associations were observed for instant, ground, and decaffeinated coffee, across common causes of death, and regardless of genetic caffeine metabolism score. For example, the HRs for 6 or more cups per day ranged from 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53-0.94) to 0.92 (95% CI, 0.78-1.10), with no evidence of effect modification across strata of caffeine metabolism score (P = .17 for heterogeneity). Conclusions and Relevance: Coffee drinking was inversely associated with mortality, including among those drinking 8 or more cups per day and those with genetic polymorphisms indicating slower or faster caffeine metabolism. These findings suggest the importance of noncaffeine constituents in the coffee-mortality association and provide further reassurance that coffee drinking can be a part of a healthy diet.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29971434","10.1001/jamainternmed.2018.2425"

Objective: To examine the potential of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurement in identifying those at greater risk of cognitive decline in a large community cohort of healthy people. Design, Setting, and Participants: UK Biobank is a prospective, multicenter, community-based study of UK residents aged 40 to 69 years at enrollment who underwent baseline retinal optical coherence tomography imaging, a physical examination, and a questionnaire. The pilot study phase was conducted from March 2006 to June 2006, and the main cohort underwent examination for baseline measures from April 2007 to October 2010. Four basic cognitive tests were performed at baseline, which were then repeated in a subset of participants approximately 3 years later. We analyzed eyes with high-quality optical coherence tomography images, excluding those with eye disease or vision loss, a history of ocular or neurological disease, or diabetes. We explored associations between RNFL thickness and cognitive function using multivariable logistic regression modeling to control for demographic as well as physiologic and ocular variation. Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds ratios (ORs) for cognitive performance in the lowest fifth percentile in at least 2 of 4 cognitive tests at baseline, or worsening results on at least 1 cognitive test at follow-up. These analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, height, refraction, intraocular pressure, education, and socioeconomic status. Results: A total of 32038 people were included at baseline testing, for whom the mean age was 56.0 years and of whom 17172 (53.6%) were women. A thinner RNFL was associated with worse cognitive performance on baseline assessment. A multivariable regression controlling for potential confounders showed that those in the thinnest quintile of RNFL were 11% more likely to fail at least 1 cognitive test (95% CI, 2.0%-2.1%; P = .01). Follow-up cognitive tests were performed for 1251 participants (3.9%). Participants with an RNFL thickness in the 2 thinnest quintiles were almost twice as likely to have at least 1 test score be worse at follow-up cognitive testing (quintile 1: OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.29-2.85; P < .001; quintile 2: OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.40-3.08; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: A thinner RNFL is associated with worse cognitive function in individuals without a neurodegenerative disease as well as greater likelihood of future cognitive decline. This preclinical observation has implications for future research, prevention, and treatment of dementia.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29946685","10.1001/jamaneurol.2018.1578"

A prior analysis of population-based cohorts aged 15 to 22 years recruited from the United Kingdom and Israel suggested myopia and high myopia were approximately 10% more common in first-born compared with later-born children. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether myopia was associated with birth order in an earlier generation than studied previously and, if so, whether the association was attenuated after adjusting for education exposure, as predicted by the hypothesis that the education of children with later birth orders is less intense. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of UK Biobank participants recruited from 2006 to 2010. Analysis was restricted to participants aged 40 to 69 years who had a vision assessment, self-reported white ethnicity, and no history of eye disorders (N = 89,120). Myopia and high myopia were defined as autorefraction of -0.75 diopters (D) or less and -6.00 D or less, respectively. EXPOSURES: Birth order and information on potential confounders including highest educational qualification ascertained using a structured questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Odds ratios (ORs) for myopia and high myopia by birth order, using logistic regression and adjusting for age and sex (model 1) or age, sex, and highest educational qualification (model 2). RESULTS: In model 1 (no adjustment for education), birth order was associated with both myopia and high myopia (eg, comparing first- vs second-born individuals; OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08-1.16; P = 1.40E-11 and OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11-1.30; P = 3.60E-06 for myopia and high myopia, respectively). The risk for myopia became progressively lower for later birth orders, suggesting a dose response. In model 2 (after adjusting for education), the effect sizes were attenuated by approximately 25% (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.12; P = 1.30E-06 and OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.25; P = 4.60E-04 for myopia and high myopia, respectively) and the apparent dose response was abolished. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data suggest that the association between birth order and myopia is not due to a new environmental pressure in the last 30 to 40 years. The attenuated effect size after adjusting for educational exposure supports a role for reduced parental investment in education of children with later birth orders in their relative protection from myopia.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26448589","10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2015.3556"

Thus, refractive status is commonly assigned using questionnaires. In a population survey, often only a few condition-specific self-reported questions can be included, so the questions used must be effective in ruling in those who have the trait of interest and ruling out those who do not. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of identification of refractive status using self-reported age at and/or reason for first use of glasses or contact lenses (optical correction). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The UK Biobank study, a cross-sectional epidemiologic study, included 117278 participants aged 40 to 69 years in 6 regional centers in England and Wales. Data for the present study were assessed from June 2009 to July 2010. Patients underwent autorefraction measurement. Spherical equivalent in the more extreme eye was used to categorize myopia (-1.00 diopter [D] or more extreme) and hypermetropia (+1.00 D or more extreme). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity of the reason for optical correction were assessed using autorefraction as the gold standard. Receiver operating characteristic curves assessed the accuracy of self-reported age at first use of optical correction and incremental improvement with addition of the reason. RESULTS: Of the 95240 participants who reported using optical correction (55.6% female; mean [SD] age, 57.7 [7.5] years), 92121 (96.7%) provided their age at first use and 93156 (97.8%) provided the reason. For myopia, sensitivity of the reason for optical correction was 89.1% (95% CI, 88.7%-89.4%), specificity was 83.7% (95% CI, 83.4%-84.0%), and positive and negative predictive values were 72.7% (95% CI, 72.2%-73.1%) and 94.0% (95% CI, 93.8%-94.2%), respectively. The area under the curve was 0.829 (95% CI, 0.826-0.831) and improved to 0.928 (95% CI, 0.926-0.930) with combined information. By contrast, self-report of the reason for optical correction of hypermetropia had low sensitivity (38.1%; 95% CI, 37.6%-38.6%), and the area under the curve with combined information was 0.713 (95% CI, 0.709-0.716). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In combination, self-report of the reason for and age at first use of optical correction are accurate in identifying myopia. These findings indicate an agreed set of questions could be implemented effectively in large-scale generic population-based studies to increase opportunities for integrated research on refractive error leading to development of novel prevention or treatment strategies.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27197004","10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2016.1275"

Understanding of the effect of the substantially more common near-normal vision (mild impairment) and associations with social position as well as health and life chances is limited. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of visual health (across the full acuity spectrum) with social determinants of general health and the association between visual health and health and social outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional epidemiologic study was conducted using UK Biobank data from 6 regional centers in England and Wales. A total of 112314 volunteers (aged 40-73 years) were assessed in June 2009 and July 2010. Data analysis was performed from May 20, 2013, to November 19, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Habitual (correction if prescribed) distance visual acuity was used to assign participants to 1 of 8 categories from bilateral normal visual acuity (logMAR, 0.2 or better; Snellen equivalent, 6/9.5 or better) to visual impairment or blindness (logMAR, 0.5 or worse; Snellen equivalent, 6/19 or worse) using World Health Organization and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision taxonomy. Relationships between vision, key social determinants and health and social outcomes (including the main factors that define an individual's life-the social, economic, educational, and employment opportunities and outcomes experienced by individuals during their life course) were examined using multivariable regression. RESULTS: Of the of 112314 participants, 61169 were female (54.5%); mean (SD) age was 56.8 (8.1) years. A total of 759 (0.7%) of the participants had visual impairment or blindness, and an additional 25678 (22.9%) had reduced vision in 1 or both eyes. Key markers of social position were independently associated with vision in a gradient across acuity categories; in a gradient of increasing severity, all-cause impaired visual function was associated with adverse social outcomes and impaired general and mental health. These factors, including having no educational qualifications (risk ratio [RR], 1.86 [95% CI, 1.69-2.04]), having a higher deprivation score (RR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.07-1.09]), and being in a minority ethnic group (eg, Asian) (RR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.83-2.30]), were independently associated with being in the midrange vision category (at legal threshold for driving). This level of vision was associated with an increased risk of being unemployed (RR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.31-1.84]), having a lower-status job (RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.09-1.41]), living alone (RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.10-1.39]), and having mental health problems (RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.04-1.20]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Impaired vision in adults is common, and even near-normal vision, potentially unrecognized without assessment, has a tangible influence on quality of life. Because inequalities in visual health by social position mirror other health domains, inclusion of vision in generic initiatives addressing health inequalities could address the existing significant burden of underrecognized and/or latent visual disability. Longitudinal investigations are needed to elucidate pathophysiologic pathways and target modifiable mechanisms.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27466983","10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2016.1778"

We investigated this disparity using data from Australia and the United Kingdom. Objectives: To examine the penetrance and effect size of the MYOC p.Gln368Ter variant with glaucoma and ocular hypertension (OHT). Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study within the UK Biobank (UKBB) included participants of white British ancestry. Glaucoma cases were defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses and self-reported questionnaires. Carriers of the MYOC p.Gln368Ter variant were identified using genotype imputation from arrays. In contrast, 2 Australian registry-based studies, the Australian and New Zealand Registry of Advanced Glaucoma and the Glaucoma Inheritance Study in Tasmania, ascertained glaucoma cases referred by eye care clinicians, with historic control participants recruited from other Australian studies. Samples were either directly sequenced or had genotypes determined by imputation (for the Australian registry and historic control participants). Recruitment to the UKBB occurred between 2006 and 2010, and data analysis occurred from September 2017 to July 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The penetrance and odds ratio (OR) were estimated for the MYOC p.Gln368Ter variants in participants with glaucoma and OHT. Results: A total of 411337 UKBB participants of white British ancestry (mean [SD] age, 56.6 [8.0] years) were included, plus 3071 Australian registry and 6750 historic control participants. In the UKBB, the minor allele frequency of the MYOC p.Gln368Ter variant was 1 in 786 individuals (0.13%). The odds ratio of p.Gln368Ter in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) was 6.76 (95% CI, 4.05-11.29); glaucoma (POAG, self-reported glaucoma, and unspecified glaucoma), 4.40 (95% CI, 3.38-5.71); OHT, 3.56 (95% CI, 2.53-4.92); and OHT and glaucoma combined, 4.18 (95% CI, 3.05-5.67). The penetrance of the MYOC p.Gln368Ter variant was 7.6% in patients with glaucoma, 24.3% in patients with OHT, and 30.8% in patients with OHT and glaucoma combined. In the Australian registry studies, the odds of MYOC p.Gln368Ter variant were 12.16 (95% CI, 6.34-24.97) in patients with advanced glaucoma and 3.97 (95% CI, 1.55-9.75) in those with nonadvanced glaucoma; the penetrance of glaucoma was 56.1%, and penetrance in those considered to have glaucoma or be glaucoma suspects was 69.5%. Conclusions and Relevance: The MYOC p.Gln368Ter variant confers a very high-risk effect size for advanced glaucoma; the risk is lower in nonadvanced glaucoma and OHT. In the general population sample, approximately 50% of MYOC p.Gln368Ter carriers 65 years and older had glaucoma or OHT, with higher prevalence in the Australian registry studies.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30267046","10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2018.4477"

Although people with mental illness experience reduced physical fitness and cognitive impairment, the association between muscular strength and cognition has not been examined to date. Objective: To determine associations between maximal handgrip strength and cognitive performance in people with major depression or bipolar disorder and in healthy controls. Design, Setting, and Participants: In a multicenter, population-based study conducted between February 13, 2005, and October 1, 2010, in the United Kingdom, cross-sectional analysis was conducted of baseline data from 110067 participants in the UK Biobank. Data analysis was performed between August 3 and August 18, 2017. Invitations were mailed to approximately 9.2 million UK homes, recruiting 502664 adults, all aged 37 to 73 years. Clinically validated measures were used to identify individuals with major recurrent depression (moderate or severe) or bipolar disorder (type I or type II) and healthy controls (those with no indication of present or previous mood disorders). Main Outcomes and Measures: Handgrip dynamometry was used to measure muscular function. Cognitive functioning was assessed using computerized tasks of reaction time, visual memory, number memory, reasoning, and prospective memory. Generalized linear mixed models assessed the association between handgrip strength and cognitive performance, controlling for age, educational level, sex, body weight, and geographic region. Results: Of the 110067 participants, analyses included 22699 individuals with major depression (mean [95% range] age, 55.5 [41-68] years; 7936 [35.0%] men), 1475 with bipolar disorder (age, 54.4 [41-68] years; 748 [50.7%] men), and 85893 healthy controls (age, 53.7 [41-69] years; 43000 [50.0%] men). In those with major depression, significant positive associations (P < .001) between maximal handgrip strength and improved performance on all 5 cognitive tasks were found, including visual memory (coefficient, -0.146; SE, 0.014), reaction time (coefficient, -0.036; SE, 0.002), reasoning (coefficient, 0.213; SE, 0.02), number memory (coefficient, 0.160; SE, 0.023), and prospective memory (coefficient, 0.341; SE, 0.024). Similar results were found in healthy controls. Among participants with bipolar disorder, handgrip strength was positively associated with improved visual memory (coefficient, -0.129; SE, 0.052; P = .01), reaction time (coefficient, -0.047; SE, 0.007; P < .001), prospective memory (coefficient, 0.262; SE, 0.088; P = .003), and reasoning (coefficient, 0.354; SE, 0.08; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Grip strength may provide a useful indicator of cognitive impairment in people with major depression and bipolar disorder. Future research should investigate causality, assess the functional implications of handgrip strength in psychiatric populations, and examine how interventions to improve muscular fitness affect neurocognitive status and socio-occupational functioning.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29710135","10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.0503"

An alternative hypothesis is that individuals with increased genetic risk tend to live in urban/dense areas. Objective: To assess whether adults with higher genetic risk for schizophrenia have an increased probability to live in more populated areas than those with lower risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: Four large, cross-sectional samples of genotyped individuals of European ancestry older than 18 years with known addresses in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands were included in the analysis. Data were based on the postcode of residence at the time of last contact with the participants. Community-based samples who took part in studies conducted by the Queensland Institute for Medical Research Berghofer Medical Research Institute (QIMR), UK Biobank (UKB), Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), or QSkin Sun and Health Study (QSKIN) were included. Genome-wide association analysis and mendelian randomization (MR) were included. The study was conducted between 2016 and 2018. Exposures: Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia derived from genetic data (genetic risk is independently measured from the occurrence of the disease). Socioeconomic status of the area was included as a moderator in some of the models. Main Outcomes and Measures: Population density of the place of residence of the participants determined from census data. Remoteness and socioeconomic status of the area were also tested. Results: The QIMR participants (15544; 10197 [65.6%] women; mean [SD] age, 54.4 [13.2] years) living in more densely populated areas (people per square kilometer) had a higher genetic loading for schizophrenia (r2 = 0.12%; P = 5.69 x 10-5), a result that was replicated across all 3 other cohorts (UKB: 345246; 187469 [54.3%] women; age, 65.7 [8.0] years; NTR: 11212; 6727 [60.0%] women; age, 48.6 [17.5] years; and QSKIN: 15726; 8602 [54.7%] women; age, 57.0 [7.9] years). This genetic association could account for 1.7% (95% CI, 0.8%-3.2%) of the schizophrenia risk. Estimates from MR analyses performed in the UKB sample were significant (b = 0.049; P = 3.7 x 10-7 using GSMR), suggesting that the genetic liability to schizophrenia may have a causal association with the tendency to live in urbanized locations. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study appear to support the hypothesis that individuals with increased genetic risk tend to live in urban/dense areas and suggest the need to refine the social stress model for schizophrenia by including genetics as well as possible gene-environment interactions.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29936532","10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.1581"

Understanding the neural connectivity that underlies both conditions and mediates the association between them is likely to lead to better-directed treatments for depression and associated sleep problems. Objective: To identify the brain areas that mediate the association of depressive symptoms with poor sleep quality and advance understanding of the differences in brain connectivity in depression. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study collected data from participants in the Human Connectome Project using the Adult Self-report of Depressive Problems portion of the Achenbach Adult Self-Report for Ages 18-59, a survey of self-reported sleep quality, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Cross-validation of the sleep findings was conducted in 8718 participants from the UK Biobank. Main Outcomes and Measures: Correlations between functional connectivity, scores on the Adult Self-Report of Depressive Problems, and sleep quality. Results: A total of 1017 participants from the Human Connectome Project (of whom 546 [53.7%] were female; age range, 22 to 35 years) drawn from a general population in the United States were included. The Depressive Problems score was positively correlated with poor sleep quality (r = 0.371; P < .001). A total of 162 functional connectivity links involving areas associated with sleep, such as the precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex, and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, were identified. Of these links, 39 were also associated with the Depressive Problems scores. The brain areas with increased functional connectivity associated with both sleep and Depressive Problems scores included the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, insula, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, amygdala, temporal cortex, and precuneus. A mediation analysis showed that these functional connectivities underlie the association of the Depressive Problems score with poor sleep quality (beta = 0.0139; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: The implication of these findings is that the increased functional connectivity between these brain regions provides a neural basis for the association between depression and poor sleep quality. An important finding was that the Depressive Problems scores in this general population were correlated with functional connectivities between areas, including the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, precuneus, angular gyrus, and temporal cortex. The findings have implications for the treatment of depression and poor sleep quality.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30046833","10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2018.1941"

We conducted sex-specific GWAS in a healthy and medication-free subsample of the UK Biobank (n = 155,961), identifying 77 genome-wide significant loci associated with body fat percentage (BF%) and 174 with fat-free mass (FFM).

Genetic correlations of BF% and FFM with the largest GWAS of AN by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium were estimated to explore shared genomics. The genetic correlations of BF%male and BF%female with AN differed significantly from each other (p < .0001, delta = -0.17), suggesting that the female preponderance in AN may, in part, be explained by sex-specific anthropometric and metabolic genetic factors increasing liability to AN.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593698","10.1002/ajmg.b.32709"

METHODS: We studied 27,691 adults from the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS) and replicated novel findings among 376,435 adults from the UK Biobank. Trait-specific polygenic risk scores for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, and systolic blood pressure (BP) were used to test the associations of genetically predicted elevations in each trait with incident OA diagnosis (n = 3,559), OA joint replacement (n = 2,780), or both (total OA; n = 4,226) in Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses in the MDCS, and with self-reported and/or hospital-diagnosed OA (n = 65,213) in the UK Biobank. Multivariable MR, MR-Egger, and weighted median MR were used to adjust for potential pleiotropic biases. RESULTS: In the MDCS, genetically predicted elevation in LDL cholesterol level was associated with a lower risk of OA diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 0.83 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.73-0.95] per 1SD increase) and total OA (OR 0.87 [95% CI 0.78-0.98]), which was supported by multivariable MR for OA diagnosis (OR 0.84 [95% CI 0.75-0.95]) and total OA (0.87 [95% CI 0.78-0.97]), and by conventional 2-sample MR for OA diagnosis (OR 0.86 [95% CI 0.75-0.98]). MR-Egger indicated no pleiotropic bias. Genetically predicted elevation in BMI was associated with an increased risk of OA diagnosis (OR 1.65 [95% CI 1.14-2.41]), while MR-Egger indicated pleiotropic bias and a larger association with OA diagnosis (OR 3.25 [1.26-8.39]), OA joint replacement (OR 3.81 [95% CI 1.39-10.4]), and total OA (OR 3.41 [95% CI 1.43-8.15]). No associations were observed between genetically predicted HDL cholesterol level, triglyceride level, FPG level, or systolic BP and OA outcomes. The associations with LDL cholesterol levels were replicated in the UK Biobank (OR 0.95 [95% CI 0.93-0.98]). CONCLUSION: Our MR study provides evidence of a causal role of lower LDL cholesterol level and higher BMI in OA.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30615301","10.1002/art.40812"

Most IV methods assume that the function relating the exposure to the expected value of the outcome (the exposure-outcome relationship) is linear. However, in practice, this assumption may not hold. Indeed, often the primary question of interest is to assess the shape of this relationship. We present two novel IV methods for investigating the shape of the exposure-outcome relationship: a fractional polynomial method and a piecewise linear method. We divide the population into strata using the exposure distribution, and estimate a causal effect, referred to as a localized average causal effect (LACE), in each stratum of population. The fractional polynomial method performs metaregression on these LACE estimates. The piecewise linear method estimates a continuous piecewise linear function, the gradient of which is the LACE estimate in each stratum. Both methods were demonstrated in a simulation study to estimate the true exposure-outcome relationship well, particularly when the relationship was a fractional polynomial (for the fractional polynomial method) or was piecewise linear (for the piecewise linear method). The methods were used to investigate the shape of relationship of body mass index with systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28317167","10.1002/gepi.22041"

Here, we introduce a multiethnic polygenic risk score that combines training data from European samples and training data from the target population. We applied this approach to predict type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a Latino cohort using both publicly available European summary statistics in large sample size (Neff = 40k) and Latino training data in small sample size (Neff = 8k). Here, we attained a >70% relative improvement in prediction accuracy (from R(2 ) = 0.027 to 0.047) compared to methods that use only one source of training data, consistent with large relative improvements in simulations. We observed a systematically lower load of T2D risk alleles in Latino individuals with more European ancestry, which could be explained by polygenic selection in ancestral European and/or Native American populations. We predict T2D in a South Asian UK Biobank cohort using European (Neff = 40k) and South Asian (Neff = 16k) training data and attained a >70% relative improvement in prediction accuracy, and application to predict height in an African UK Biobank cohort using European (N = 113k) and African (N = 2k) training data attained a 30% relative improvement.

We analyzed data from 162,691 postmenopausal women in UK Biobank followed from 2006 to 2014. Body size was measured by trained technicians. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used to estimate relative risks. Analyses were stratified by age at recruitment, region and socioeconomic status, and adjusted for family history of breast cancer, age at menarche, age at first birth, parity, age at menopause, previous hormone replacement therapy use, smoking, alcohol intake, height, physical activity and ethnicity. We observed 2,913 incident invasive breast cancers during a mean 5.7 years of follow-up. There was a continuous increase in risk of postmenopausal breast cancer with increasing adiposity, across all measures. The point estimate, comparing women in the top (median 37.6 kg) to bottom (median 17.6 kg) quartile of body fat mass was 1.70 (95% confidence interval 1.52-1.90). The magnitudes of the associations between per SD increase in BMI and body fat mass with breast cancer risk were similar, suggesting impedance measures of fat were not substantially better indicators of risk than anthropometric measures. After adjusting for body fat mass, the associations between anthropometric measures of central adiposity and breast cancer risk were attenuated. The magnitude of risk, across all measures of adiposity, was greater in women who had been postmenopausal for 12 or more years.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29569713","10.1002/ijc.31394"

UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort comprising 502,637 men and women aged 40 to 69 years at recruitment. Supplementation with calcium/vitamin D was self-reported, and information on incident hospital admission (ICD-10) for ischemic heart disease (IHD), myocardial infarction (MI), and subsequent death was obtained from linkage to national registers. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate longitudinal relationships between calcium/vitamin D supplementation and hospital admission for men/women, controlling for covariates. A total of 475,255 participants (median age 58 years, 55.8% women) had complete data on calcium/vitamin D supplementation. Of that number, 33,437 participants reported taking calcium supplements; 19,089 vitamin D; and 10,007 both. In crude and adjusted analyses, there were no associations between use of calcium supplements and risk of incident hospital admission with either IHD, or subsequent death. Thus, for example, in unadjusted models, the hazard ratio (HR) for admission with myocardial infarction was 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-1.20, p = 0.79) among women taking calcium supplementation. Corresponding HR for men is 1.16 (95% CI 0.92-1.46, p = 0.22). After full adjustment, HR (95% CI) were 0.82 (0.62-1.07), p = 0.14 among women and 1.12 (0.85-1.48), p = 0.41 among men. Adjusted HR (95% CI) for admission with IHD were 1.05 (0.92-1.19), p = 0.50 among women and 0.97 (0.82-1.15), p = 0.77 among men. Results were similar for vitamin D and combination supplementation. There were no associations with death, and in women, further adjustment for hormone-replacement therapy use did not alter the associations. In this very large prospective cohort, there was no evidence that use of calcium/vitamin D supplementation was associated with increased risk of hospital admission or death after ischemic cardiovascular events.

Diagnoses of the events were confirmed by primary care physicians and coded according to the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10: M80-M82). RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 6.75 (5th to 95th percentile interval, 1.53 to 8.37) years, 394 newly diagnosed cases of osteoporosis occurred, with 40 (10.2%) cases being associated with a pathological fracture. SMM/ht(2) , aSMM/ht(2) residual, and SMM were lower in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis compared with women without (all P < 0.0001), while SMM/bm x 100 (P = 0.003), but not aSMM/BMI (P = 0.59), was higher in the osteoporosis group. The unadjusted rates of osteoporosis increased with decreasing quintiles for SMM/ht(2) , aSMM/ht(2) , residuals, and SMM (all P trend <0.0001), while the incidence of osteoporosis increased with increasing SMM/bm x 100 (P trend =0.001), but not for aSMM/BMI (P = 0.45). After minimally adjusting for age and after full adjustment, SMM/ht(2) , aSMM/ht(2) , and SMM were the only measure that consistently predicted osteoporosis in the total group of postmenopausal women [hazard ratio (HR) 0.65-0.67, all P </= 0.0001], in lean women (HR 0.62-0.68; all P </= 0.001), and women with increased adiposity (HR 0.64-0.68; all P </= 0.01). In fully adjusted models, the changes in the R(2) statistic were 13.4%, 11.6%, and 15.3% for the SMM/ht(2) (aSMM/ht(2) ), residual, and SMM, but only 4.9% and 1.3% for SMM/bm x 100 and aSMM/BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle mass measures adjusted for height only (SMM/ht(2) , aSMM/ht(2) ) appear to be better muscle-relevant risk factors for incident osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, including when stratified into lean participants and participants with increased adiposity.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30398016","10.1002/jcsm.12359"

METHODS: The first 6,021 participants scanned by UK Biobank were included. Body composition profiles (BCPs) were calculated, including abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), thigh muscle volume, liver fat, and muscle fat infiltration (MFI), determined using magnetic resonance imaging. Associations between BCP and metabolic status were investigated using matching procedures and multivariable statistical modeling. RESULTS: Matched control analysis showed that higher VAT and MFI were associated with CHD and T2D (P < 0.001). Higher liver fat was associated with T2D (P < 0.001) and lower liver fat with CHD (P < 0.05), matching on VAT. Multivariable modeling showed that lower VAT and MFI were associated with metabolic health (P < 0.001), and liver fat was nonsignificant. Associations remained significant adjusting for sex, age, BMI, alcohol, smoking, and physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Body composition profiling enabled an intuitive visualization of body composition and showed the complexity of associations between fat distribution and metabolic status, stressing the importance of a multivariable approach. Different diseases were linked to different BCPs, which could not be described by a single fat compartment alone.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29785727","10.1002/oby.22210"

RESULTS: MR analyses supported a causal association between higher BMI and greater risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per 1 kg/m(2) : 1.03; 95% CI: 0.99-1.07) and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.01-1.19), specifically coronary heart disease (HR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.00-1.25) and those excluding coronary heart disease/stroke/aortic aneurysm (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.03-1.48), stomach cancer (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.87-1.62), and esophageal cancer (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.98-1.53), and a decreased risk of lung cancer mortality (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.85-1.08). Sex stratification supported the causal role of higher BMI increasing bladder cancer mortality risk (males) but decreasing respiratory disease mortality risk (males). The J-shaped observational association between BMI and mortality was visible with MR analyses, but the BMI at which mortality was minimized was lower and the association was flatter over a larger BMI range.

We cast the problem as classification tasks, where the bottom and top slices are tested for the presence of typical basal and apical patterns. Inspired by the success of deep learning methods, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to construct a set of discriminative features. We evaluated our approach on a subset of the UK Biobank datasets. Precision and Recall figures for detecting missing apical slice (MAS) (81.61% and 88.73 %) and missing basal slice (MBS) (74.10% and 88.75 %) are superior to other state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.

Comorbidity information is an important resource in this exploration of shared molecular background. To extend the current pairwise, correlation based methods, we investigate a systems-based approach for the use of separated large-scale multi-morbidity data to explore common latent factors of related diseases. We constructed a multi-morbidity dataset from the UK Biobank by filtering rare diseases. In the first phase of our method, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method over Bayesian networks to construct a Bayesian dependency map, which is confounded with many known factors. In the second phase, the method could incorporate prior causal information between the diseases and information about the known confounding by demographic, medical, genetic, environmental factors. The difference between the known causal and confounding relations and the observed dependencies is used to bind the extent of further latent factors. This reconstruction of the shared latent factors happens hierarchically in a top-down fashion, terminating with the identification of latent factors for pair of diseases. We compare our method with other comorbidity methods and systems-based network approaches in the field of psychiatry, focusing on depression and anxiety.

These studies have usually focused on additive association tests. Identifying deviations from additivity may provide new biological insights and explain some of the missing heritability for these diseases. METHODS: We performed a GWA study using a dominance deviation model for BMI, obesity (29,925 cases) and type 2 diabetes (4,040 cases) in 120,286 individuals of British ancestry from the UK Biobank study. We also investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms previously shown to be associated with these traits showed any enrichment for departures from additivity. RESULTS: Known obesity-associated variants in FTO showed strong evidence of deviation from additivity (p DOMDEV = 3 x 10(-5)) through a recessive effect of the allele associated with higher BMI. The average BMI of individuals carrying zero, one or two BMI-raising alleles was 27.27 (95% CI 27.22, 27.31) kg/m(2), 27.54 (95% CI 27.50, 27.58) kg/m(2) and 28.07 (95% CI 28.00, 28.14) kg/m(2), respectively. A similar effect was observed in 105,643 individuals from the GIANT Consortium (p DOMDEV = 0.003; meta-analysis p DOMDEV = 1 x 10(-7)). For type 2 diabetes, we detected a recessive effect (p DOMDEV = 5 x 10(-4)) at CDKAL1. Relative to homozygous non-risk allele carriers, homozygous risk allele carriers had an OR of 1.48 (95% CI 1.32, 1.65), while the heterozygous group had an OR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.99, 1.14), a result consistent with that of a previous study. We did not identify any novel associations at genome-wide significance. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Although we found no evidence of widespread non-additive genetic effects contributing to obesity and type 2 diabetes risk, we did find robust examples of recessive effects at the FTO and CDKAL1 loci.

INTRODUCTION: We aimed to investigate the relationship between prior fracture and risk of incident ischaemic cardiovascular events in a UK population-based cohort. METHODS: UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort comprising 502,637 men and women aged 40-69 years, with detailed baseline assessment. History of fracture was self-reported, and details of hospital admissions for ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (ICD-10:I20-I25) were obtained through linkage to UK Hospital Episode Statistics. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the prospective relationships between prior fracture and hospital admission for men and women, controlling for age, BMI, smoking, alcohol, educational level, physical activity, systolic blood pressure, calcium and vitamin D use, ankle spacing-width, heel BUA and HRT use (women). RESULTS: Amongst men, a fragility fracture (hip, spine, wrist or arm fracture resulting from a simple fall) within the previous 5 years was associated with a 35% increased risk of IHD admission (fully adjusted HR 1.35; 95%CI 1.00, 1.82; p = 0.047), with the relationship predominantly driven by wrist fractures. Associations with hospitalisation for angina in men were similar in age-adjusted models [HR1.54; 95%CI: 1.03, 2.30), p = 0.037], but did not remain statistical significant after full adjustment [HR 1.64; 95%CI: 0.88, 3.07); p = 0.121]. HRs for admission with angina were lower in women, and neither age- nor fully adjusted relationships attained statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Prior fragility fracture is an independent risk factor for incident ischaemic cardiovascular events in men. Further work may clarify whether this association is causal or represents shared risk factors, but these findings are likely to be of value in risk assessment of both osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29479646","10.1007/s00198-018-4426-8"

It has been shown to distinguish between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. However, these studies were conducted in patients at high risk for liver disease. This study establishes the normal reference range of cT1 values for a large UK population, and assesses interactions of age and gender. METHODS: MR data were acquired on a 1.5 T system as part of the UK Biobank Imaging Enhancement study. Measures for Proton Density Fat Fraction and cT1 were calculated from the MRI data using a multiparametric MRI software application. Data that did not meet quality criteria were excluded from further analysis. Inter and intra-reader variability was estimated in a set of data. A cohort at low risk for NAFL was identified by excluding individuals with BMI >/= 25 kg/m(2) and PDFF >/= 5%. Of the 2816 participants with data of suitable quality, 1037 (37%) were classified as at low risk. RESULTS: The cT1 values in the low-risk population ranged from 573 to 852 ms with a median of 666 ms and interquartile range from 643 to 694 ms. Iron correction of T1 was necessary in 36.5% of this reference population. Age and gender had minimal effect on cT1 values. CONCLUSION: The majority of cT1 values are tightly clustered in a population at low risk for NAFL, suggesting it has the potential to serve as a new quantitative imaging biomarker for studies of liver health and disease.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30032383","10.1007/s00261-018-1701-2"

The purpose of this investigation was to identify genetic markers associated with corneal and refractive astigmatism in a large-scale European ancestry cohort (UK Biobank) who underwent keratometry and autorefraction at an assessment centre. Genome-wide association studies for corneal and refractive astigmatism were performed in individuals of European ancestry (N = 86,335 and 88,005 respectively), with the mean corneal astigmatism or refractive astigmatism in fellow eyes analysed as a quantitative trait (dependent variable). Genetic correlation between the two traits was calculated using LD Score regression. Gene-based and gene-set tests were carried out using MAGMA. Single marker-based association tests for corneal astigmatism identified four genome-wide significant loci (P < 5 x 10(-8)) near the genes ZC3H11B (1q41), LINC00340 (6p22.3), HERC2/OCA2 (15q13.1) and NPLOC4/TSPAN10 (17q25.3). Three of these loci also demonstrated genome-wide significant association with refractive astigmatism: LINC00340, HERC2/OCA2 and NPLOC4/TSPAN10. The genetic correlation between corneal and refractive astigmatism was 0.85 (standard error = 0.068, P = 1.37 x 10(-35)). Here, we have undertaken the largest genome-wide association studies for corneal and refractive astigmatism to date and identified four novel loci for corneal astigmatism, two of which were also novel loci for refractive astigmatism. These loci have previously demonstrated association with axial length (ZC3H11B), myopia (NPLOC4), spherical equivalent refractive error (LINC00340) and eye colour (HERC2). The shared role of these novel candidate genes for astigmatism lends further support to the shared genetic susceptibility of myopia and astigmatism.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30306274","10.1007/s00439-018-1942-8"

Using the largest accelerometer cohort to date, we aimed to investigate whether there is an association between disease status and accelerometer variables after a 5-year follow-up. METHODS: 106,053 UK Biobank participants wore a wrist-worn GENEactiv monitor. Those with acceptable wear time (> 3 days) were split into 4 cardio-metabolic disease groups based on self-report disease status which was collected 5 +/- 1 years prior. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate associations, controlling for confounders and stratified for gender. RESULTS: Average daily acceleration was lower in men ('healthy'-42 +/- 15 mg v 'Type 2 diabetes + cardiovascular disease (CVD)'-31 +/- 12 mg) and women ('healthy'-44 +/- 13 mg v 'Type 2 diabetes + CVD'-31 +/- 11 mg) with cardio-metabolic disease and this was consistent across both week and weekend days. Men and women with the worst cardio-metabolic disease perform around half of moderate to vigorous physical activity on a daily basis compared to healthy individuals, and spend almost 7 h per day in 30 min inactivity bouts. Significant associations were seen between cardio-metabolic disease and accelerometer variables 5 years on when controlling for confounders. CONCLUSION: In the largest accelerometer cohort to date, there are significant associations between cardio-metabolic disease and physical activity variables after 5 years of follow-up.

In multiple logistic regression controlling for potential confounders, current smokers were more likely to have a hearing loss than non-smokers (odds ratio (OR) 1.15, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.21). Among non-smokers, those who reported passive exposure to tobacco smoke were more likely to have a hearing loss (OR 1.28, 95 %CI 1.21-1.35). For both smoking and passive smoking, there was evidence of a dose-response effect. Those who consume alcohol were less likely to have a hearing loss than lifetime teetotalers. The association was similar across three levels of consumption by volume of alcohol (lightest 25 %, OR 0.61, 95 %CI 0.57-0.65; middle 50 % OR 0.62, 95 %CI 0.58-0.66; heaviest 25 % OR 0.65, 95 %CI 0.61-0.70). The results suggest that lifestyle factors may moderate the risk of hearing loss. Alcohol consumption was associated with a protective effect. Quitting or reducing smoking and avoiding passive exposure to tobacco smoke may also help prevent or moderate age-related hearing loss.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24899378","10.1007/s10162-014-0461-0"

Overall, both observationally and genetically, alcohol intake is negatively correlated with BMI. Phenotypic correlations ranged from -0.01 to -0.17, and genetic correlations ranged from -0.1 to -0.4. Genetic correlations tended to be stronger than the phenotypic correlations, and these correlations were stronger in females and between BMI and, specifically, frequency of use.

We constructed polygenic scores for difficulties with language and learning to read from genome-wide data in ~6,600 children, adolescents and young adults, and tested their association with health, socioeconomic outcomes and brain structure measures collected in adults (maximal N = 111,749). Polygenic risk of reading difficulties was associated with reduced income, educational attainment, self-rated health and verbal-numerical reasoning (p < 0.00055). Polygenic risk of language difficulties predicted income (p = 0.0005). The small effect sizes ranged 0.01-0.03 of a standard deviation, but these will increase as genetic studies for reading ability get larger. Polygenic scores for childhood cognitive ability and educational attainment were correlated with polygenic scores of reading and language (up to 0.09 and 0.05, respectively). But when they were included in the prediction models, the observed associations between polygenic reading and adult outcomes mostly remained. This suggests that the pathway from reading ability to social outcomes is not only via associated polygenic loads for general cognitive function and educational attainment. The presence of non-overlapping genetic effect is indicated by the genetic correlations of around 0.40 (childhood intelligence) and 0.70 (educational attainment) with reading ability. Mendelian randomization approaches will be important to dissociate any causal and moderating effects of reading and related traits on social outcomes.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28711986","10.1007/s10519-017-9859-x"

METHODS: This study included 126,182 postmenopausal women (2,636 with breast cancer and 123,546 without) from UK Biobank. Cancer diagnoses were ascertained through the linkage to the UK National Health Service Central Registers. Information on breast cancer risk factors and coffee consumption was collected at baseline and updated during follow-up. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate associations between coffee consumption and breast cancer, overall and in stratified analyses by woman's PMH status (none, past, current). RESULTS: In the overall analysis, coffee consumption was not associated with breast cancer risk (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.91-1.11 for 2-3 cups/day, and HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87-1.10 for >/= 4 cups/day, p-trend = 0.69). Women with no PMH history who consumed >/= 4 cups/day had a 16% reduced risk of breast cancer as compared to women who consumed < 7 cups/week (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71-1.00). Among women with past PMH, those consuming >/= 4 cups/day had a 22% greater risk of breast cancer than women consuming < 7 cups/week (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47). No association was found among current PMH users. We found no significant interaction between PMH and coffee consumption (p = 0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Coffee consumption might be associated with increased breast cancer risk in women who used hormones in the past. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and elucidate potential biological mechanisms underlying the observed associations.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29651651","10.1007/s10552-018-1028-x"

Although fully-automated left ventricular (LV) analysis was performed in the original acquisition, this was not designed for unsupervised incorporation into epidemiological studies. We sought to evaluate automated LV mass and volume (Siemens syngo InlineVF versions D13A and E11C), against manual analysis in a substantial sub-cohort of UK Biobank participants. Eight readers from two centers, trained to give consistent results, manually analyzed 4874 UK Biobank cases for LV end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF) and LV mass (LVM). Agreement between manual and InlineVF automated analyses were evaluated using Bland-Altman analysis and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Tenfold cross-validation was used to establish a linear regression calibration between manual and InlineVF results. InlineVF D13A returned results in 4423 cases, whereas InlineVF E11C returned results in 4775 cases and also reported LVM. Rapid visual assessment of the E11C results found 178 cases (3.7%) with grossly misplaced contours or landmarks. In the remaining 4597 cases, LV function showed good agreement: ESV -6.4 +/- 9.0 ml, 0.853 (mean +/- SD of the differences, ICC) EDV -3.0 +/- 11.6 ml, 0.937; SV 3.4 +/- 9.8 ml, 0.855; and EF 3.5 +/- 5.1%, 0.586. Although LV mass was consistently overestimated (29.9 +/- 17.0 g, 0.534) due to larger epicardial contours on all slices, linear regression could be used to correct the bias and improve accuracy. Automated InlineVF results can be used for case-control studies in UK Biobank, provided visual quality control and linear bias correction are performed. Improvements between InlineVF D13A and InlineVF E11C show the field is rapidly advancing, with further improvements expected in the near future.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28836039","10.1007/s10554-017-1225-9"

This analysis is based on data from 70,913 men and women (832 all-cause, 177 cardiovascular and 503 cancer deaths over 5.7-year follow-up) who provided valid CRF and GS data, and with no history of heart attack/stroke/cancer at baseline.

The highest GS category had an HR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.66-0.95) for all-cause mortality compared with the lowest, after adjustment for confounders and CRF. Similar results were found for cardiovascular and cancer mortality. The HRs for the combination of highest CRF and GS were 0.53 (95% CI 0.39-0.72) for all-cause mortality and 0.31 (95% CI 0.14-0.67) for cardiovascular mortality, compared with the reference category of lowest CRF and GS: no significant association for cancer mortality (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.48-1.02).

PURPOSE/INTRODUCTION: We aimed to test the hypothesis that a history of fracture is associated with reporting chronic widespread bodily pain (CWBP), using baseline data from the UK Biobank cohort, comprising 502,656 people aged 40-69 years. METHODS: The case definition of current chronic widespread bodily pain was based on a response of 'yes' to the question 'do you have pain all over the body?' and 'yes' to 'and have you experienced pain all over the body for more than 3 months?' Multivariable Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to test the relationship between fracture (occurring within 5 years prior to the baseline interview, and recorded by self-report) at the spine, hip, upper limb or lower limb and CWBP, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Of 501,733 participants (mean age 56.5 years), 7130 individuals reported CWBP and 23,177 had a history of fracture affecting the upper limb, lower limb, spine and/or hip. Individuals with prior fracture were significantly more likely to report CWBP than those without. After adjustment for potential risk factors (age, gender, demographic, lifestyle and socioeconomic, and psychological), risk ratios were attenuated but remained statistically significant with a more than doubling of risk for CWBP with spine fractures in men (risk ratio (RR) 2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.66-4.31; p < 0.001) and women (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.35-3.37, p = 0.001) and with hip fractures in women (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.33-3.59; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional analysis, previous fracture is associated with an increased likelihood of chronic widespread bodily pain, particularly with hip fractures in women, and spine fractures in both sexes. If replicated, these findings may help inform the identification of those most at risk of chronic widespread pain post-fracture, allowing preventative measures to be targeted.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26678491","10.1007/s11657-015-0252-1"

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the associations among sleep duration, chronotype, and physical activity, screen-based sedentary behavior, tobacco use, and dietary intake. METHODS: Regression models were used to examine sleep duration and chronotype as the predictors and cardiovascular risk factors as outcomes of interest in a cross-sectional sample of 439,933 adults enrolled in the UK Biobank project. RESULTS: Short sleepers were 45 % more likely to smoke tobacco than adequate sleepers (9.8 vs. 6.9 %, respectively). Late chronotypes were more than twice as likely to smoke tobacco than intermediate types (14.9 vs. 7.4 %, respectively). Long sleepers reported 0.61 more hours of television per day than adequate sleepers. Early chronotypes reported 0.20 fewer daily hours of computer use per day than intermediate chronotypes. Early chronotypes had 0.25 more servings of fruit and 0.13 more servings of vegetables per day than late chronotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Short and long sleep duration and late chronotype are associated with greater likelihood of cardiovascular risk behaviors. Further work is needed to determine whether these findings are maintained in the context of objective sleep and circadian estimates, and in more diverse samples. The extent to which promoting adequate sleep duration and earlier sleep timing improves heart health should also be examined prospectively.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27056396","10.1007/s12160-016-9797-5"

This has important implications for the management of healthcare systems, since the endocrinal, cardiometabolic and other changes associated with increased adiposity may be associated with substantial healthcare costs. METHODS: We studied the association between various measures of adiposity and inpatient hospital costs through record linkage between UK Biobank and records of inpatient care in England and Wales. UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort study that aimed to recruit men and women aged between 40 and 69 from 2006 to 2010. We applied generalised linear models to cost per person year to estimate the marginal effect of adiposity, and average adjusted predicted costs of adiposity. RESULTS: Valid cost and body mass index (BMI) data from 457,689 participants were available for inferential analysis. Some 54.4% of individuals included in the analysis sample had positive inpatient healthcare costs over the period of follow-up. Median hospital costs per person-year of follow-up were pound89, compared to mean costs of pound481. Mean BMI overall was 27.4 kg/m(2) (standard deviation 4.8). The marginal effect of a unit increase in BMI was pound13.61 (99% confidence interval pound12.60- pound14.63) per person-year of follow up. The marginal effect of a standard deviation increase in BMI was pound69.20 (99% confidence interval pound64.98- pound73.42). The marginal effect of becoming obese was pound136.35 (99% confidence interval pound124.62- pound148.08). Average adjusted predicted inpatient hospital costs increased almost linearly when modelled using continuous measure of adiposity. Sensitivity analysis of different scenarios did not substantially change these conclusions, although there was some evidence of attenuation of the effects of adiposity when controlling for waist-hip ratios, and when individuals who self-reported any pre-existing conditions were excluded from analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Higher adiposity is associated with higher inpatient hospital costs. Further scrutiny using causal inferential methods is warranted to establish if further public health investments are required to manage the large healthcare costs observationally associated with overweight and obesity.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599049","10.1007/s40258-018-0450-2"

In former smokers, BMI was positively associated with cigarettes formerly smoked; further, the genetic factors related to a greater number of cigarettes smoked were also responsible for a higher BMI. In current smokers, there was a positive association between BMI and number of cigarettes smoked, though this relationship did not appear to be influenced by similar genetic factors. We found a positive genetic relationship between smoking in current/former smokers and BMI in never smokers (who would be unmarred by the effects of nicotine). In addition to CPD, in current smokers, we looked at two variables, time from waking to first cigarette and difficulty not smoking for a day, that may align better with cigarette and food 'craving.' However, these smoking measures provided mixed findings with respect to their relationship with BMI. Overall, the positive relationships between the genetic factors that influence CPD in smokers and the genetic factors that influence BMI in former and never smokers point to common biological influences behind smoking and obesity.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30286397","10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.09.025"

The very large sample size of the UK Biobank is ideal for using population differentiation to detect selection and enables an analysis of the UK population structure at fine resolution. In this study, analyses of 113,851 UK Biobank samples showed that population structure in the UK is dominated by five principal components (PCs) spanning six clusters: Northern Ireland, Scotland, northern England, southern England, and two Welsh clusters. Analyses of ancient Eurasians revealed that populations in the northern UK have higher levels of Steppe ancestry and that UK population structure cannot be explained as a simple mixture of Celts and Saxons. A scan for unusual population differentiation along the top PCs identified a genome-wide-significant signal of selection at the coding variant rs601338 in FUT2 (p = 9.16 x 10(-9)).

Using population genotype data from Finland and the UK Biobank, we show here that a reference panel of 1,000 individuals from the target population is adequate for a GWAS cohort of up to 10,000 individuals, whereas smaller panels, such as those from the 1000 Genomes Project, should be avoided. We also show, both theoretically and empirically, that the size of the reference panel needs to scale with the GWAS sample size; this has important consequences for the application of these methods in ongoing GWAS meta-analyses and large biobank studies.

It can be estimated by current state-of-art methods, i.e., linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and genomic restricted maximum likelihood (GREML). The massively reduced computing burden of LDSC compared to GREML makes it an attractive tool, although the accuracy (i.e., magnitude of standard errors) of LDSC estimates has not been thoroughly studied. In simulation, we show that the accuracy of GREML is generally higher than that of LDSC. When there is genetic heterogeneity between the actual sample and reference data from which LD scores are estimated, the accuracy of LDSC decreases further. In real data analyses estimating the genetic correlation between schizophrenia (SCZ) and body mass index, we show that GREML estimates based on approximately 150,000 individuals give a higher accuracy than LDSC estimates based on approximately 400,000 individuals (from combined meta-data). A GREML genomic partitioning analysis reveals that the genetic correlation between SCZ and height is significantly negative for regulatory regions, which whole genome or LDSC approach has less power to detect. We conclude that LDSC estimates should be carefully interpreted as there can be uncertainty about homogeneity among combined meta-datasets. We suggest that any interesting findings from massive LDSC analysis for a large number of complex traits should be followed up, where possible, with more detailed analyses with GREML methods, even if sample sizes are lesser.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29754766","10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.03.021"

However, whether pathways leading to albuminuria are causal for cardiometabolic diseases is unclear. We addressed this question using a Mendelian randomization framework in the UK Biobank, a large population-based cohort. We first performed a genome-wide association study for albuminuria in 382,500 individuals and identified 32 new albuminuria loci. We constructed albuminuria genetic risk scores and tested for association with cardiometabolic diseases. Genetically elevated albuminuria was strongly associated with increased risk of hypertension (1.38 OR; 95% CI, 1.27-1.50 per 1 SD predicted increase in albuminuria, p = 7.01 x 10(-14)). We then examined bidirectional associations of albuminuria with blood pressure which suggested that genetically elevated albuminuria led to higher blood pressure (2.16 mmHg systolic blood pressure; 95% CI, 1.51-2.82 per 1 SD predicted increase in albuminuria, p = 1.22 x 10(-10)) and that genetically elevated blood pressure led to more albuminuria (0.005 SD; 95% CI 0.004-0.006 per 1 mmHg predicted increase in systolic blood pressure, p = 2.45 x 10(-13)). These results support the existence of a feed-forward loop between albuminuria and blood pressure and imply that albuminuria could increase risk of cardiovascular disease through blood pressure. Moreover, they suggest therapies that target albuminuria-increasing processes could have antihypertensive effects that are amplified through inhibition of this feed-forward loop.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30220432","10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.08.004"

Our aim was to develop PRSs, optimized for prediction of estrogen receptor (ER)-specific disease, from the largest available genome-wide association dataset and to empirically validate the PRSs in prospective studies. The development dataset comprised 94,075 case subjects and 75,017 control subjects of European ancestry from 69 studies, divided into training and validation sets. Samples were genotyped using genome-wide arrays, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected by stepwise regression or lasso penalized regression. The best performing PRSs were validated in an independent test set comprising 11,428 case subjects and 18,323 control subjects from 10 prospective studies and 190,040 women from UK Biobank (3,215 incident breast cancers). For the best PRSs (313 SNPs), the odds ratio for overall disease per 1 standard deviation in ten prospective studies was 1.61 (95%CI: 1.57-1.65) with area under receiver-operator curve (AUC) = 0.630 (95%CI: 0.628-0.651). The lifetime risk of overall breast cancer in the top centile of the PRSs was 32.6%. Compared with women in the middle quintile, those in the highest 1% of risk had 4.37- and 2.78-fold risks, and those in the lowest 1% of risk had 0.16- and 0.27-fold risks, of developing ER-positive and ER-negative disease, respectively. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that this PRS was well calibrated and predicts disease risk accurately in the tails of the distribution. This PRS is a powerful and reliable predictor of breast cancer risk that may improve breast cancer prevention programs.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554720","10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.11.002"

We show via simulations with real genotypes that the method, functionally informed novel discovery of risk loci (FINDOR), correctly controls the false-positive rate at null loci and attains a 9%-38% increase in the number of independent associations detected at causal loci, depending on trait polygenicity and sample size. We applied FINDOR to 27 independent complex traits and diseases from the interim UK Biobank release (average N = 130K). Averaged across traits, we attained a 13% increase in genome-wide significant loci detected (including a 20% increase for disease traits) compared to unweighted raw p values that do not use functional data. We replicated the additional loci in independent UK Biobank and non-UK Biobank data, yielding a highly statistically significant replication slope (0.66-0.69) in each case. Finally, we applied FINDOR to the full UK Biobank release (average N = 416K), attaining smaller relative improvements (consistent with simulations) but larger absolute improvements, detecting an additional 583 GWAS loci. In conclusion, leveraging functional enrichment using our method robustly increases GWAS power.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30595370","10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.11.008"

RESULTS: Means for total and vigorous physical activity were 31.3 (SD, 30.8) and 9.7 (SD, 14.8) metabolic equivalent h/wk, respectively, for premenopausal and 34.4 (SD, 33.1) and 8.9 (SD, 15.6) metabolic equivalent h/wk, respectively, for postmenopausal women. Multiple linear regression models showed that in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, body mass index, body fat mass and percentage, trunk fat mass and percentage, waist and hip circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio were lower in women with higher physical activity (P < .0001).

METHODS: We used Affymetrix Power Tools and PennCNV-Affy software to analyze Affymetrix microarrays of the first 152,728 genotyped individuals. We annotated a list of 93 CNVs and compared their frequencies with control datasets. We analyzed the performance on seven cognitive tests of carriers of 12 CNVs associated with schizophrenia (n = 1087) and of carriers of another 41 neurodevelopmental CNVs (n = 484). RESULTS: The frequencies of the 93 CNVs in the Biobank subjects were remarkably similar to those among 26,628 control subjects from other datasets. Carriers of schizophrenia-associated CNVs and of the group of 41 other neurodevelopmental CNVs had impaired performance on the cognitive tests, with nine of 14 comparisons remaining statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. They also had lower educational and occupational attainment (p values between 10(-7) and 10(-18)). The deficits in cognitive performance were modest (Z score reductions between 0.01 and 0.51), compared with individuals with schizophrenia in the Biobank (Z score reductions between 0.35 and 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study on the cognitive phenotypes of CNVs to date. Adult carriers of neurodevelopmental CNVs from the general population have significant cognitive deficits.

In this study we use a powerful polygenic approach, with polygenic scores derived from the genome-wide association study, to investigate the etiological overlap between ADHD and frequently co-occurring traits and disorders. METHODS: Polygenic risk scores for ADHD derived from the mega genome-wide association study (20,183 cases and 35,191 control subjects) were computed in a large-scale adult population sample (N = 135,726) recruited by the UK Biobank.

The effects of sex were investigated via inclusion of an interaction term in the models. RESULTS: Polygenic risk for ADHD significantly and positively predicted body mass index (R(2) = .45%; p = 5 x 10(-129)), neuroticism (R(2) = .09%; p = 2 x 10(-24)), depression (R(2) = .11%; p = 2 x 10(-13)), anxiety (R(2) = .06%; p = 3 x 10(-4)), risk taking (R(2) = .12%; p = 9 x 10(-25)), alcohol intake (R(2) = .09%; p = 8 x 10(-29)), smoking (R(2) = .33%; p = 4 x 10(-21)), alcohol dependency (R(2) = .21%; p = 5 x 10(-6)), and negatively predicted verbal-numerical reasoning (R(2) = .38%; p = 5 x 10(-36)). Polygenic risk scores did not significantly predict schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, although this may be because of the small number of diagnostic cases. We found no interaction effects between polygenic risk for ADHD and sex on any phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that common genetic variation underlying risk for clinically diagnosed ADHD also contributes to higher body mass index, neuroticism, anxiety and depressive disorders, alcohol and nicotine use, risk taking, and lower general cognitive ability in the general population.

Higher cognitive ability is also associated with greater educational attainment and increased household income. Understanding neural mechanisms underlying cognitive ability is of crucial importance for determining the nature of these associations. In the current study, we examined the spontaneous activity of the brain at rest to investigate its relationships with not only cognitive ability but also educational attainment and household income. METHODS: We used a large sample of resting-state neuroimaging data from the UK Biobank (n = 3950). RESULTS: First, analysis at the whole-brain level showed that connections involving the default mode network (DMN), frontoparietal network (FPN), and cingulo-opercular network (CON) were significantly positively associated with levels of cognitive performance assessed by a verbal-numerical reasoning test (standardized beta cingulo-opercular values ranged from 0.054 to 0.097, pcorrected < .038). Connections associated with higher levels of cognitive performance were also significantly positively associated with educational attainment (r = .48, n = 4160) and household income (r = .38, n = 3793). Furthermore, analysis on the coupling of functional networks showed that better cognitive performance was associated with more positive DMN-CON connections, decreased cross-hemisphere connections between the homotopic network in the CON and FPN, and stronger CON-FPN connections (absolute betas ranged from 0.034 to 0.063, pcorrected < .045). CONCLUSIONS: The current study found that variation in brain resting-state functional connectivity was associated with individual differences in cognitive ability, largely involving the DMN and lateral prefrontal network.

RESULTS: We found significantly lower FA in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (beta = -.035, pcorrected = .029) and significantly higher MD in a global measure of thalamic radiations (beta = .029, pcorrected = .021), as well as higher MD in the superior (beta = .034, pcorrected = .039) and inferior (beta = .029, pcorrected = .043) longitudinal fasciculus and in the anterior (beta = .025, pcorrected = .046) and superior (beta = .027, pcorrected = .043) thalamic radiation associated with NETRIN1-PRS. Genomic-PRS was also associated with lower FA and higher MD in several tracts. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that variation in the NETRIN1 signaling pathway may confer risk for major depressive disorder through effects on a number of white matter tracts.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30197049","10.1016/j.bpsc.2018.07.006"

This study aims to investigate whether reported risk factors for prostate cancer are associated with PSA testing in a large middle-aged population-based cohort in the UK. METHODS: The cross-sectional association between a wide range of sociodemographic, lifestyle, dietary and health characteristics with PSA testing was examined in 212,039 men aged 40-69 years in UK Biobank. RESULTS: A total of 62,022 (29%) men reported they had ever had a PSA test. A wide range of factors was associated with a higher likelihood of PSA testing including age, height, education level, family history of prostate cancer, black ethnic origin, not being in paid/self-employment, living with a wife or partner, having had a vasectomy, being diagnosed with cancer or hypertension and having a high dietary intake of cereal, cooked and salad/raw vegetables, fresh fruit and tea. Conversely, socioeconomic deprivation, Asian ethnic origin, current smoking, low alcohol intake, high body-mass index, high coffee consumption and being diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease or stroke were associated with a lower likelihood of PSA testing. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of sociodemographic, lifestyle and health-related characteristics are associated with PSA testing, suggesting that observed associations of some of these traits with risk for prostate cancer in epidemiological studies may be, at least partially, due to detection bias.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27693812","10.1016/j.canep.2016.09.010"

Selenium intake and polymorphisms in selenoproteins have been linked to the risk of certain cancers though data for glioma are sparse. METHODS: In a case-control study of glioma, we examined the associations of selenium in toenails and genetic variants in the selenoenzyme pathway with the risk of glioma and patient survival. A total of 423 genetic variants in 29 candidate genes in the selenoenzyme pathway were studied in 1547 glioma cases and 1014 healthy controls. Genetic associations were also examined in the UK Biobank cohort comprised of 313,868 persons with 322 incident glioma cases. Toenail selenium was measured in a subcohort of 300 glioma cases and 300 age-matched controls from the case-control study. RESULTS: None of the 423 variants studied were consistently associated with glioma risk in the case-control and cohort studies. Moreover, toenail selenium in the case-control study had no significant association with glioma risk (p trend=0.70) or patient survival among 254 patients with high grade tumors (p trend=0.70). CONCLUSION: The present study offers no support for the hypothesis that selenium plays a role in the onset of glioma or patient outcome.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29777993","10.1016/j.canep.2018.05.002"

Models developed to identify patients at risk for EAC and increase early detection have been developed based on data from case-control studies. We analyzed data from a prospective study to identify factors available to clinicians that identify individuals with a high absolute risk of EAC. METHODS: We collected data from 355,034 individuals (all older than 50 years) without a prior history of cancer enrolled in the UK Biobank prospective cohort study from 2006 through 2010; clinical data were collected through September 2014. We identified demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors, measured at baseline, that associated with development of EAC within 5 years using logistic regression analysis. We used these data to create a model to identify individuals at risk for EAC. Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity analyses. RESULTS: Within up to 5 years of follow up, 220 individuals developed EAC. Age, sex, smoking, body mass index, and history of esophageal conditions or treatments identified individuals who developed EAC (AUROC, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.77-0.82). We used these factors to develop a scoring system and identified a point cut off that 104,723 individuals (29.5%), including 170 of the 220 cases with EAC, were above. The scoring system identified individuals who developed EAC with 77.4% sensitivity and 70.5% specificity. The 5-year risk of EAC was 0.16% for individuals with scores above the threshold and 0.02% for individuals with scores below the threshold. CONCLUSION: We combined data on several well-established risk factors that are available to clinicians to develop a system to identify individuals with a higher absolute risk of EAC within 5 years. Studies are needed to evaluate the utility of these factors in a multi-stage, triaged, screening program.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29559360","10.1016/j.cgh.2018.03.014"

In this paper, we propose such an algorithm, which uses the segmented vessel map to determine the suitability of retinal images for use in the creation of vessel morphometric data suitable for epidemiological studies.

A random subset of 800 retinal images from UK Biobank (a large prospective study of 500,000 middle aged adults; where 68,151 underwent retinal imaging) was used to examine the performance of the image quality algorithm. The algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 95.33% and a specificity of 91.13% for the detection of inadequate images. The strong performance of this image quality algorithm will make rapid automated analysis of vascular morphometry feasible on the entire UK Biobank dataset (and other large retinal datasets), with minimal operator involvement, and at low cost.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26894596","10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.01.027"

However, analysis of data from large population based studies is needed to help resolve uncertainties in some of these associations. This requires automated systems that extract quantitative measures of vessel morphology from large numbers of retinal images. Associations between retinal vessel morphology and disease precursors/outcomes may be similar or opposing for arterioles and venules. Therefore, the accurate detection of the vessel type is an important element in such automated systems. This paper presents a deep learning approach for the automatic classification of arterioles and venules across the entire retinal image, including vessels located at the optic disc. This comprises of a convolutional neural network whose architecture contains six learned layers: three convolutional and three fully-connected. Complex patterns are automatically learnt from the data, which avoids the use of hand crafted features. The method is developed and evaluated using 835,914 centreline pixels derived from 100 retinal images selected from the 135,867 retinal images obtained at the UK Biobank (large population-based cohort study of middle aged and older adults) baseline examination. This is a challenging dataset in respect to image quality and hence arteriole/venule classification is required to be highly robust. The method achieves a significant increase in accuracy of 8.1% when compared to the baseline method, resulting in an arteriole/venule classification accuracy of 86.97% (per pixel basis) over the entire retinal image.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28917120","10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.09.005"

Explanations for the association between SES and health typically focus on factors that are environmental in origin [4]. However, common SNPs have been found collectively to explain around 18% of the phenotypic variance of an area-based social deprivation measure of SES [5]. Molecular genetic studies have also shown that common physical and psychiatric diseases are partly heritable [6]. It is possible that phenotypic associations between SES and health arise partly due to a shared genetic etiology. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on social deprivation and on household income using 112,151 participants of UK Biobank. We find that common SNPs explain 21% of the variation in social deprivation and 11% of household income. Two independent loci attained genome-wide significance for household income, with the most significant SNP in each of these loci being rs187848990 on chromosome 2 and rs8100891 on chromosome 19. Genes in the regions of these SNPs have been associated with intellectual disabilities, schizophrenia, and synaptic plasticity. Extensive genetic correlations were found between both measures of SES and illnesses, anthropometric variables, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive ability. These findings suggest that some SNPs associated with SES are involved in the brain and central nervous system. The genetic associations with SES obviously do not reflect direct causal effects and are probably mediated via other partly heritable variables, including cognitive ability, personality, and health.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27818178","10.1016/j.cub.2016.09.035"

We performed a genome-wide association study of headache as a single entity, using 74,461 cases and 149,312 controls. RESULTS: We identified 3343 SNPs which reached the genome-wide significance level of P<5x10(-8).

Disrupted rhythms of rest and activity are recognised as risk factors for major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of low relative amplitude (RA), an objective measure of rest-activity cycles derived from the accelerometer data of 71,500 UK Biobank participants. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for low RA were used to investigate potential associations with psychiatric phenotypes. OUTCOMES: Two independent genetic loci were associated with low RA, within genomic regions for Neurofascin (NFASC) and Solute Carrier Family 25 Member 17 (SLC25A17). A secondary GWAS of RA as a continuous measure identified a locus within Meis Homeobox 1 (MEIS1). There were no significant genetic correlations between low RA and any of the psychiatric phenotypes assessed. However, PRS for low RA was significantly associated with mood instability across multiple PRS thresholds (at PRS threshold 0.05: OR=1.02, 95% CI=1.01-1.02, p=9.6x10(-5)), and with major depressive disorder (at PRS threshold 0.1: OR=1.03, 95% CI=1.01-1.05, p=0.025) and neuroticism (at PRS threshold 0.5: Beta=0.02, 95% CI=0.007-0.04, p=0.021).

We studied the associations in UK Biobank and then included the results in a meta-analysis of published cohort studies. METHODS: UK Biobank, a general population cohort study, recruited participants aged 40-69 years. Incident breast cancer was ascertained via linkage to routine hospital admission, cancer registry and death certificate data. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to explore the associations between red and processed meat consumption and breast cancer. Previously published cohort studies were identified from a systematic review using PubMed and Ovid and a meta-analysis conducted using a random effects model. RESULTS: Over a median of 7 years follow-up, 4819 of the 262,195 women developed breast cancer.

The study investigated the effects of residential green exposures on adiposity using a large and diverse population sample drawn from the UK Biobank. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a population based cross-sectional study of 333,183 participants aged 38-73years with individual-level data on residential greenness and built environment exposures. Residential greenness was assessed through 0.50-metre resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from spectral reflectance measurements in remotely sensed colour infrared data and measured around geocoded participants' dwelling. A series of continuous and binary outcome models examined the associations between residential greenness and markers of adiposity, expressed as body-mass index (BMI) in kg/m(2), waist circumference (WC) in cm, whole body fat (WBF) in kg and obesity (BMI>/=30kg/m(2)) after adjusting for other activity-influencing built environment and individual-level confounders. Sensitivity analyses involved studying effect modification by gender, age, urbanicity and SES as well as examining relationships between residential greenness and active travel behaviour. RESULTS: Residential greenness was independently and consistently associated with lower adiposity, the association being robust to adjustments. An interquartile increment in NDVI greenness was associated with lower BMI (betaBMI=-0.123kg/m(2), 95% CI: -0.14, -0.10kg/m(2)), WC (betaWC=-0.551cm, 95% CI: -0.61, -0.50cm), and WBF (betaWBF=-0.138kg, 95% CI: -0.18, -0.10kg) as well as a reduced relative risk of obesity (RR=0.968, 95% CI: 0.96, 0.98). Residential greenness was beneficially related with active travel, being associated with higher odds of using active mode for non-work travel (OR=1.093, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.11) as well as doing >30min walking (OR=1.039, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.05). CONCLUSION: Residing in greener areas was associated with healthy weight outcomes possibly through a physical activity-related mechanism. Green allocation and design may act as upstream-level public health interventions ameliorating the negative health externalities of obesogenic urban environments.

METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the UK Biobank cohort. Adults aged 40-69 (n=143,828) were assessed using measures of reasoning, reaction time and memory. Self-reported data on lifetime features of major depression and bipolar disorder were used to construct groups for comparison against controls. Regression models examined the association between mood disorder classification and cognitive performance, adjusting for sociodemographic, lifestyle and clinical confounders. RESULTS: Inverse associations between lifetime history of bipolar or severe recurrent depression features and cognitive performance were attenuated or reversed after adjusting for confounders, including psychotropic medication use and current depressive symptoms. Participants with a lifetime history of single episode or moderate recurrent depression features outperformed controls to a small (but statistically significant) degree, independent of adjustment for confounders. There was a significant interaction between use of psychotropic medication and lifetime mood disorder features, with reduced cognitive performance observed in participants taking psychotropic medication. CONCLUSIONS: In this general population sample of adults in middle age, lifetime features of recurrent depression or bipolar disorder were only associated with cognitive impairment within unadjusted analyses. These findings underscore the importance of adjusting for potential confounders when investigating mood disorder-related cognitive function.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26647871","10.1016/j.eurpsy.2015.08.006"

Intelligence appears to interact with neuroticism and mitigate its detrimental effects on physical health and mortality. However, the inter-relationships of neuroticism and intelligence for major depressive disorder (MDD) and psychological distress has not been well examined. METHODS: Associations and interactions between neuroticism and general intelligence (g) on MDD, self-reported depression, and psychological distress were examined in two population-based cohorts: Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS, n=19,200) and UK Biobank (n=90,529). The Eysenck Personality Scale Short Form-Revised measured neuroticism and g was extracted from multiple cognitive ability tests in each cohort. Family structure was adjusted for in GS:SFHS. RESULTS: Neuroticism was strongly associated with increased risk for depression and higher psychological distress in both samples. Although intelligence conferred no consistent independent effects on depression, it did increase the risk for depression across samples once neuroticism was adjusted for. Results suggest that higher intelligence may ameliorate the association between neuroticism and self-reported depression although no significant interaction was found for clinical MDD. Intelligence was inversely associated with psychological distress across cohorts. A small interaction was found across samples such that lower psychological distress associates with higher intelligence and lower neuroticism, although effect sizes were small. CONCLUSIONS: From two large cohort studies, our findings suggest intelligence acts a protective factor in mitigating the effects of neuroticism on psychological distress. Intelligence does not confer protection against diagnosis of depression in those high in neuroticism.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28365468","10.1016/j.eurpsy.2016.12.012"

Using a dataset of approximately 450,000 participants from the UK Biobank study, we aimed to assess the impact of this seasonality on birth weight, age at menarche, adult height and body mass index (BMI). Birth weight, age at menarche and height, but not BMI, were highly significantly associated with season of birth. Individuals born in summer (June-July-August) had higher mean birth weight (P = 8 x 10(-10)), later pubertal development (P = 1.1 x 10(-45)) and taller adult height (P = 6.5 x 10(-9)) compared to those born in all other seasons. Concordantly, those born in winter (December-January-February) showed directionally opposite differences in these outcomes. A secondary comparison of the extreme differences between months revealed higher odds ratios [95% confidence intervals (CI)] for low birth weight in February vs. September (1.23 [1.15-1.32], P = 4.4 x 10(-10)), for early puberty in September vs. July (1.22 [1.16-1.28], P = 7.3 x 10(-15)) and for short stature in December vs. June (1.09 [1.03-1.17], P = 0.006). The above associations were also seen with total hours of sunshine during the second trimester, but not during the first three months after birth. Additional associations were observed with educational attainment; individuals born in autumn vs. summer were more likely to continue in education post age 16 years (P = 1.1 x 10(-91)) or attain a degree-level qualification (P = 4 x 10(-7)). However, unlike other outcomes, an abrupt difference was seen between those born in August vs. September, which flank the start of the school year. Our findings provide support for the 'fetal programming' hypothesis, refining and extending the impact that season of birth has on childhood growth and development. Whilst other mechanisms may contribute to these associations, these findings are consistent with a possible role of in utero vitamin D exposure.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27123493","10.1016/j.heliyon.2015.e00031"

The causal role of testosterone can be investigated using a Mendelian randomization approach. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed genetic associations of variants in two gene regions (SHBG and JMJD1C) with several cardiovascular risk factors (lipids, adiponectin, blood pressure, anthropometric traits) plus male pattern baldness, including control outcomes and potential mediators. We assessed genetic associations with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk in the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (171,191 individuals including 60,801 cases), and associations with CAD and ischaemic stroke risk in the UK Biobank (367,643 individuals including 25,352 CAD cases and 3650 ischaemic stroke cases). Genetic predictors of increased serum testosterone were associated with lipids, blood pressure, and height. There was some evidence of an association with risk of CAD (SHBG gene region: odds ratio (OR) 0.95 per 1 unit increase in log-transformed testosterone [95% confidence interval: 0.81-1.12, p=0.55]; JMJD1C gene region: OR 1.24 [1.01-1.51, p=0.04]) and ischaemic stroke both overall (SHBG: OR 1.05 [0.64, 1.73, p=0.83]; JMJD1C: OR 2.52 [1.33, 4.77, p=0.005]) and in men. However, associations with some control outcomes were in the opposite direction to that expected. CONCLUSIONS: Sex hormone-related mechanisms appear to be relevant to cardiovascular risk factors and for stroke (particularly for men). However, the extent that these findings are specifically informative about endogenous testosterone or testosterone supplementation is unclear. These findings underline a fundamental limitation for the use of Mendelian randomization where biological knowledge about the function of genetic variants is uncertain.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804699","10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.05.051"

The present study aims to examine the associations between neighbourhood walkability and hypertension in a large and diverse population-based cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the association between neighbourhood walkability and blood pressure outcomes for N=429,334 participants drawn from the UK Biobank and aged 38-73 years. Neighbourhood walkability was objectively modelled from detailed building footprint-level data within multi-scale functional neighbourhoods (1.0-, 1.5- and 2.0-kilometer street catchments of geocoded dwelling). A series of linear and modified Poisson regression models were employed to examine the association between walkability and outcomes of diastolic blood pressure (DBP in mmHg), systolic blood pressure (SBP in mmHg) and prevalent hypertension adjusting for socio-demographic, lifestyle and related physical environmental covariates. We also examined the relationship between walkability and change in blood pressure for a sub-sample of participants with follow-up data and tested for interaction effects of age, sex, employment status, neighbourhood SES, residential density and green exposure. RESULTS: Neighbourhood walkability within one-kilometer street catchment was beneficially associated with all the three blood pressure outcomes, independent of all other factors. Each interquartile increment in walkability was associated with the lower blood pressure outcomes of DBP (beta=-0.358, 95% CI: -0.42, -0.29mmHg), SBP (beta=-0.833, 95% CI: -0.95, -0.72mmHg) as well as reduced hypertension risk (RR=0.970, 95% CI: 0.96, 0.98). The results remained consistent across spatial and temporal scales and were sensitive to sub-groups, with pronounced protective effects among female participants, those aged between 50 and 60 years, in employment, residing in deprived, high density and greener areas. CONCLUSION: This large population-based cohort found evidence of protective association between neighbourhood walkability and blood pressure outcomes. Given the enduring public health impact of community design on individual behaviour and lifestyle, of particular interest, are the targetted upstream-level interventions in city design aimed at optimizing walkability. Further long term studies are required to assess its sustained effects upon hypertension prevention and control.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29398408","10.1016/j.ijheh.2018.01.009"

UK Biobank recruited adults across England, Scotland and Wales, between March 2006 and July 2010: 54,019 participants (women 52%) with complete data were included in the analysis. Those who died in the first year of follow-up (n = 58) were excluded. Fluid intelligence was measured as the number of correct answers during a two minute logic/reasoning-test, reaction time was measured as average time taken to respond to matching symbols on a computer screen and cardiorespiratory fitness was measured through a sub-maximal exercise test. Associations with mortality were assessed by Cox-proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, social deprivation, cancer and non-cancer illnesses, medications, employment, education, smoking, BMI, diet, sleep, and physical activity. Over 5.8 years of follow-up, there were 779 deaths. Higher intelligence (hazard ratio [HR] per SD = 0.91; 95% CI 0.84, 0.99), faster reaction time (HR per SD = 0.92; 0.85, 0.98) and higher fitness (HR per SD = 0.85; 0.78, 0.93) were associated with a lower risk of mortality after adjustment for each other and other covariates.

As such, lowering Lp(a) levels has emerged as a therapeutic strategy. Beyond target identification, human genetics may contribute to the development of new therapies by defining the full spectrum of beneficial and adverse consequences and by developing a dose-response curve of target perturbation. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to establish the full phenotypic impact of LPA gene variation and to estimate a dose-response curve between genetically altered plasma Lp(a) and risk for CHD. METHODS: We leveraged genetic variants at the LPA gene from 3 data sources: individual-level data from 112,338 participants in the U.K. Biobank; summary association results from large-scale genome-wide association studies; and LPA gene sequencing results from case subjects with CHD and control subjects free of CHD. RESULTS: One SD genetically lowered Lp(a) level was associated with a 29% lower risk of CHD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69 to 0.73), a 31% lower risk of peripheral vascular disease (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.80), a 13% lower risk of stroke (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.96), a 17% lower risk of heart failure (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.94), and a 37% lower risk of aortic stenosis (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.83). We observed no association with 31 other disorders, including type 2 diabetes and cancer. Variants that led to gain of LPA gene function increased the risk for CHD, whereas those that led to loss of gene function reduced the CHD risk. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond CHD, genetically lowered Lp(a) levels are associated with a lower risk of peripheral vascular disease, stroke, heart failure, and aortic stenosis. As such, pharmacological lowering of plasma Lp(a) may influence a range of atherosclerosis-related diseases.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28007139","10.1016/j.jacc.2016.10.033"

Epidemiological analyses have identified many biomarker-CAD relationships; however, these associations may arise from reverse causation and/or confounding and therefore may not represent true causal associations. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses overcome these limitations. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to identify causal mediators of CAD through a comprehensive screen of 237 biomarkers using MR. METHODS: MR was performed by identifying genetic determinants of 227 biomarkers in ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction With Initial Glargine Intervention) trial participants (N = 4,147) and combining these with genetic effects on CAD from the CARDIoGRAM consortium (60,801 cases and 123,504 controls). Blood concentrations of novel biomarkers identified by MR were then tested for association with incident major adverse cardiovascular events in ORIGIN. RESULTS: Six biomarkers were found to be causally linked to CAD after adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing. The causal role of 4 of these is well documented, whereas macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) and stromal cell-derived factor 1 (CXCL12) have not previously been reported, to the best of our knowledge. MR analysis predicted an 18% higher risk of CAD per SD increase in CSF1 (odds ratio: 1.18; 95% confidence interval: 1.08 to 1.30; p = 2.1 x 10(-4)) and epidemiological analysis identified a 16% higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events per SD (hazard ratio: 1.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.09 to 1.23; p < 0.001). Elevated CXCL12 levels were also identified as a causal risk factor for CAD with consistent epidemiological results. Furthermore, genetically predicted CSF1 and CXCL12 levels were associated with CAD in the UK Biobank (n = 343,735). CONCLUSIONS: The study identified CSF1 and CXCL12 as causal mediators of CAD in humans. Understanding the mechanism by which these markers mediate CAD will provide novel insights into CAD and could lead to new approaches to prevention. These results support targeting inflammatory processes and macrophages, in particular, to prevent CAD, consistent with the recent CANTOS (Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study).

However, the potential of genomic risk scores to help predict CAD outcomes has not been evaluated comprehensively, because available studies have involved limited genomic scope and limited sample sizes. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to construct a genomic risk score for CAD and to estimate its potential as a screening tool for primary prevention. METHODS: Using a meta-analytic approach to combine large-scale, genome-wide, and targeted genetic association data, we developed a new genomic risk score for CAD (metaGRS) consisting of 1.7 million genetic variants. We externally tested metaGRS, both by itself and in combination with available data on conventional risk factors, in 22,242 CAD cases and 460,387 noncases from the UK Biobank. RESULTS: The hazard ratio (HR) for CAD was 1.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.68 to 1.73) per SD increase in metaGRS, an association larger than any other externally tested genetic risk score previously published. The metaGRS stratified individuals into significantly different life course trajectories of CAD risk, with those in the top 20% of metaGRS distribution having an HR of 4.17 (95% CI: 3.97 to 4.38) compared with those in the bottom 20%. The corresponding HR was 2.83 (95% CI: 2.61 to 3.07) among individuals on lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medications. The metaGRS had a higher C-index (C = 0.623; 95% CI: 0.615 to 0.631) for incident CAD than any of 6 conventional factors (smoking, diabetes, hypertension, body mass index, self-reported high cholesterol, and family history). For men in the top 20% of metaGRS with >2 conventional factors, 10% cumulative risk of CAD was reached by 48 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: The genomic score developed and evaluated here substantially advances the concept of using genomic information to stratify individuals with different trajectories of CAD risk and highlights the potential for genomic screening in early life to complement conventional risk prediction.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30309464","10.1016/j.jacc.2018.07.079"

Many more risk loci shared between these common allergic diseases remain to be discovered, which could point to new therapeutic opportunities. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify novel risk loci shared between asthma, hay fever, and eczema by applying a gene-based test of association to results from a published GWAS that included data from 360,838 subjects. METHODS: We used approximate conditional analysis to adjust the results from the published GWAS for the effects of the top risk variants identified in that study. We then analyzed the adjusted GWAS results with the EUGENE gene-based approach, which combines evidence for association with disease risk across regulatory variants identified in different tissues. Novel gene-based associations were followed up in an independent sample of 233,898 subjects from the UK Biobank study. RESULTS: Of the 19,432 genes tested, 30 had a significant gene-based association at a Bonferroni-corrected P value of 2.5 x 10(-6). Of these, 20 were also significantly associated (P < .05/30 = .0016) with disease risk in the replication sample, including 19 that were located in 11 loci not reported to contain allergy risk variants in previous GWASs. Among these were 9 genes with a known function that is directly relevant to allergic disease: FOSL2, VPRBP, IPCEF1, PRR5L, NCF4, APOBR, IL27, ATXN2L, and LAT. For 4 genes (eg, ATXN2L), a genetically determined decrease in gene expression was associated with decreased allergy risk, and therefore drugs that inhibit gene expression or function are predicted to ameliorate disease symptoms. The opposite directional effect was observed for 14 genes, including IL27, a cytokine known to suppress TH2 responses. CONCLUSION: Using a gene-based approach, we identified 11 risk loci for allergic disease that were not reported in previous GWASs. Functional studies that investigate the contribution of the 19 associated genes to the pathophysiology of allergic disease and assess their therapeutic potential are warranted.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29679657","10.1016/j.jaci.2018.03.012"

Associations of depressive symptoms with day length and mean outdoor temperature were then examined. RESULTS: Seasonality of total depressive symptom scores, anhedonia and tiredness scores was observed in women but not men, with peaks in winter. In women, increased day length was associated with reduced reporting of low mood and anhedonia, but with increased reporting of tiredness, independent of demographic and lifestyle factors.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive. SETTING: General population. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 502,713 people living in the United Kingdom. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS: Handgrip strength was measured using a Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer, which is considered to be an accurate instrument to measure handgrip strength. In addition, self-reported chronic conditions and ethnic background were registered, and lung function was assessed using spirometry. RESULTS: After exclusion of all individuals with missing data, a nonwhite ethnic background, the presence of 1 or more self-reported conditions, and/or an obstructive lung function (defined as FEV1/FVC <0.7), new normative values for right and left handgrip strength were derived from 224,830 and 224,852 individuals (54.2% women; age: 55.0 [8.0] years; height: 169.0 [9.2] cm; body mass index: 26.9 [4.4] kg/m(2)) with a nonobstructed spirometry (FEV1: 3.0 [0.8] L). Men were stronger than women. Moreover, significant associations were found between handgrip strength and height, and between handgrip strength and age. Finally, percentiles 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, and 95 were calculated for right and left handgrip strength, after stratification for gender, age, and height.

Therefore, measurement of FFM is important in nutritional assessment. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a convenient method to assess FFM and FFM index (FFMI; FFM/height(2)). Although reference values have been established for individuals with normal body weight, no specific cutoff values are available for overweight and obese populations. Also, limited studies accounted for the age-related decline in FFM. OBJECTIVE: To determine BMI- and age-specific reference values for abnormal low FFM(I) in white-ethnic men and women free of self-reported disease from the general population. DESIGN: The UK Biobank is a prospective epidemiological study of the general population from the United Kingdom. Individuals in the age category 45 to 69 years were analyzed. In addition to body weight, FFM and FFMI were measured using a Tanita BC-418MA. Also, self-reported chronic conditions and ethnic background were registered, and lung function was assessed using spirometry. RESULTS: After exclusion of all individuals with missing data, nonwhite ethnicity, self-reported disease, body mass index (BMI) less than 14 or 36 kg/m(2) or higher, and/or an obstructive lung function, reference values for FFM and FFMI were derived from 186,975 individuals (45.9% men; age: 56.9 +/- 6.8 years; BMI: 26.5 +/- 3.6 kg/m(2); FFMI 18.3 +/- 2.4 kg/m(2)).

Percentiles 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, and 95 were calculated for FFM, FFMI, and fat mass (index), after stratification for gender, age, and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Using the UK Biobank dataset, new reference values for body composition assessed with BIA were determined in white-ethnic men and women aged 45 to 69 years.

SETTING: Six regional recruitment centers in England and Wales. DESIGN: Cross-sectional epidemiological study. METHODS: Data were collected on sociodemographic factors and medical history; self-report on eyes/vision included reason for wearing optical correction, eye diseases, and treatment received (including refractive laser surgery). Mean spherical equivalent was used to categorize individuals as myopic (<-1.0 diopter) or hypertrophic (>+1.0 diopter). RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2010, 117 281 subjects recruited by UK Biobank undertook an ophthalmic assessment, including autorefraction. Of those with refractive error within a range eligible for laser refractive surgery (n = 60 352), 1892 (3.1%) reported having bilateral refractive surgery and 549 (0.9%) unilateral surgery. Frequency of bilateral surgery decreased with increasing age and was higher in women. Frequency did not vary with educational attainment or accommodation status but increased with income among working age adults. Social participation, for example, regular visits to a pub or social club, was more common among those who underwent surgery. Other eye conditions were reported by 28% of those reporting refractive surgery compared with 11% of those eligible for treatment but not reporting surgery. CONCLUSION: This study provides information not available routinely on the frequency and distribution of laser refractive surgery in an adult UK population. A high frequency of ocular conditions conventionally considered contraindications to laser refractive surgery raises the possibility that extant guidance on patient selection may not be followed.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26703498","10.1016/j.jcrs.2015.05.040"

Furthermore, there is growing evidence that the perception of severity is closely related to personality factors such as neuroticism. OBJECTIVE: In a subset (N=172,621) of a large population sample of >500,000 adults aged 40 to 69years, (from the UK Biobank dataset) we calculated the prevalence of tinnitus and that which is perceived as bothersome, and examined the association between tinnitus and a putative predisposing personality factor, neuroticism. METHOD: Participants were recruited through National Health Service registers and aimed to be inclusive and as representative of the UK population as possible. The assessment included subjective questions concerning hearing and tinnitus. Neuroticism was self-rated on 13 questions from the Eysenck Personality Inventory. Associations between neuroticism and tinnitus were tested with logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Prevalence of tinnitus was significantly higher for males, and increased with age, doubling between the youngest and oldest age groups (males 13% and 26%; females 9% and 19% respectively). Of those with tinnitus, females were more likely to report bothersome tinnitus. Neuroticism was associated with current tinnitus and bothersome tinnitus, with the items: 'loneliness', 'mood swings', 'worrier/anxious' and 'miserableness', as the strongest associations of bothersome tinnitus. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroticism was identified as a novel association with tinnitus. Individuals with tinnitus and higher levels of neuroticism are more likely to experience bothersome tinnitus, possibly as a reflection of greater sensitivity to intrusive experiences.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24360142","10.1016/j.jpsychores.2013.08.018"

DESIGN: Observational study. METHODS: Data from a subsample of the UK Biobank were utilised (n=9856; mean age 58.5 years, mean body mass index 30.2kg/m(2), 62% female). PWC was measured by a bicycle ergometer and PA by an accelerometer. Pain experienced in hip, knee, back and neck/shoulder was collected by questionnaire. Linear regression modelling was used with adjustment for potential confounders to estimate the association between pain and PWC and PA. RESULTS: Increase in number of painful sites was associated with lower PWC, moderate and vigorous PA and increased low intensity PA in a dose-response relationship (all p-values for trend </=0.001) before and after adjustment for confounders. In site specific analyses, hip pain was associated with an increased low intensity PA (beta 52.8min/week, 95% CI 2.3-103.2) and reduced moderate PA (beta -50.1min/week, 95% CI -98.5 to -1.8). Knee pain was only associated with vigorous PA (beta -5.7min/week, 95% CI -10.0 to -1.3). Pain at neck/shoulder pain and back were not independently associated with PWC and PA. CONCLUSIONS: Greater number of painful sites is consistently associated with poorer PWC, increased low intensity PA and reduced moderate to vigorous PA. Clinicians should address the critical role of being physically active in managing chronic musculoskeletal pain and interventions targeting musculoskeletal pain may be needed to increase PA levels.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30448322","10.1016/j.jsams.2018.10.008"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on 36 chronic conditions from 502,643 participants aged 40 to 69 years with baseline measurements between March 13, 2006, and October 1, 2010, from the UK Biobank were extracted. We combined cluster analysis and association rule mining to assess patterns of multimorbidity overall and by age, sex, and ethnicity. A maximum of 3 clusters and 30 disease patterns were mined. Comparisons were made using lift as the main measure of association. RESULTS: Ninety-five thousand seven hundred-ten participants (19%) had 2 or more chronic conditions. The first cluster included only myocardial infarction and angina (lift=13.3), indicating that the likelihood of co-occurrence of these conditions is 13 times higher than in isolation. The second cluster consisted of 26 conditions, including cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, respiratory, and neurodegenerative diseases. The strongest association was found between heart failure and atrial fibrillation (lift=23.6). Diabetes was at the center of this cluster with strong associations with heart failure, chronic kidney disease, liver failure, and stroke (lift>2). The third cluster contained 8 highly prevalent conditions, including cancer, hypertension, asthma, and depression, and the strongest association was observed between anxiety and depression (lift=5.0). CONCLUSION: Conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma are the epicenter of disease clusters for multimorbidity. A more integrative multidisciplinary approach focusing on better management and prevention of these conditions may help prevent other conditions in the clusters.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29801777","10.1016/j.mayocp.2018.02.012"

Motion atlases can be used to learn descriptors that are linked to different pathologies and which can subsequently be used for diagnosis. To date, all such atlases have been formed and applied using data from the same modality. In this work we propose a framework to build a multimodal cardiac motion atlas from 3D magnetic resonance (MR) and 3D ultrasound (US) data. Such an atlas will benefit from the complementary motion features derived from the two modalities, and furthermore, it could be applied in clinics to detect cardiovascular disease using US data alone. The processing pipeline for the formation of the multimodal motion atlas initially involves spatial and temporal normalisation of subjects' cardiac geometry and motion. This step was accomplished following a similar pipeline to that proposed for single modality atlas formation. The main novelty of this paper lies in the use of a multi-view algorithm to simultaneously reduce the dimensionality of both the MR and US derived motion data in order to find a common space between both modalities to model their variability. Three different dimensionality reduction algorithms were investigated: principal component analysis, canonical correlation analysis and partial least squares regression (PLS). A leave-one-out cross validation on a multimodal data set of 50 volunteers was employed to quantify the accuracy of the three algorithms. Results show that PLS resulted in the lowest errors, with a reconstruction error of less than 2.3 mm for MR-derived motion data, and less than 2.5 mm for US-derived motion data. In addition, 1000 subjects from the UK Biobank database were used to build a large scale monomodal data set for a systematic validation of the proposed algorithms. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using US data alone to analyse cardiac function based on a multimodal motion atlas.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28646674","10.1016/j.media.2017.06.002"

Therefore, improving our understanding of amplitude fluctuations over the course of a resting state scan and variation in amplitude across individuals is of great relevance to the interpretation of FC findings. We investigate resting state amplitudes in two large-scale studies (HCP and UK Biobank), with the aim of determining between-subject and within-subject variability. Between-subject clustering distinguished between two groups of brain networks whose amplitude variation across subjects were highly correlated with each other, revealing a clear distinction between primary sensory and motor regions ('primary sensory/motor cluster') and cognitive networks. Within subjects, all networks in the primary sensory/motor cluster showed a consistent increase in amplitudes from the start to the end of the scan. In addition to the strong increases in primary sensory/motor amplitude, a large number of changes in FC were found when comparing the two scans acquired on the same day (HCP data). Additive signal change analysis confirmed that all of the observed FC changes could be fully explained by changes in amplitude. Between-subject correlations in UK Biobank data showed a negative correlation between primary sensory/motor amplitude and average sleep duration, suggesting a role of arousal. Our findings additionally reveal complex relationships between amplitude and head motion. These results suggest that network amplitude is a source of significant variability both across subjects, and within subjects on a within-session timescale. Future rfMRI studies may benefit from obtaining arousal-related (self report) measures, and may wish to consider the influence of amplitude changes on measures of (dynamic) functional connectivity.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28712995","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.07.014"

In the field of neuroscience, where such representations are commonly used to model structural or functional connectivity between a set of brain regions, graphs have proven to be of great importance. This is mainly due to the capability of revealing patterns related to brain development and disease, which were previously unknown. Evaluating similarity between these brain connectivity networks in a manner that accounts for the graph structure and is tailored for a particular application is, however, non-trivial. Most existing methods fail to accommodate the graph structure, discarding information that could be beneficial for further classification or regression analyses based on these similarities. We propose to learn a graph similarity metric using a siamese graph convolutional neural network (s-GCN) in a supervised setting. The proposed framework takes into consideration the graph structure for the evaluation of similarity between a pair of graphs, by employing spectral graph convolutions that allow the generalisation of traditional convolutions to irregular graphs and operates in the graph spectral domain. We apply the proposed model on two datasets: the challenging ABIDE database, which comprises functional MRI data of 403 patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 468 healthy controls aggregated from multiple acquisition sites, and a set of 2500 subjects from UK Biobank. We demonstrate the performance of the method for the tasks of classification between matching and non-matching graphs, as well as individual subject classification and manifold learning, showing that it leads to significantly improved results compared to traditional methods.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29278772","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.12.052"

WMH commonly occur in the ageing population, and are often associated with several factors such as cognitive disorders, cardiovascular risk factors, cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the fact that some links between lesion location and parametric factors such as age have already been established, the relationship between voxel-wise spatial distribution of lesions and these factors is not yet well understood. Hence, it would be of clinical importance to model the distribution of lesions at the population-level and quantitatively analyse the effect of various factors on the lesion distribution model. In this work we compare various methods, including our proposed method, to generate voxel-wise distributions of WMH within a population with respect to various factors. Our proposed Bayesian spline method models the spatio-temporal distribution of WMH with respect to a parametric factor of interest, in this case age, within a population. Our probabilistic model takes as input the lesion segmentation binary maps of subjects belonging to various age groups and provides a population-level parametric lesion probability map as output. We used a spline representation to ensure a degree of smoothness in space and the dimension associated with the parameter, and formulated our model using a Bayesian framework. We tested our algorithm output on simulated data and compared our results with those obtained using various existing methods with different levels of algorithmic and computational complexity. We then compared the better performing methods on a real dataset, consisting of 1000 subjects of the UK Biobank, divided in two groups based on hypertension diagnosis. Finally, we applied our method on a clinical dataset of patients with vascular disease. On simulated dataset, the results from our algorithm showed a mean square error (MSE) value of 7.27x10(-5), which was lower than the MSE value reported in the literature, with the advantage of being robust and computationally efficient. In the UK Biobank data, we found that the lesion probabilities are higher for the hypertension group compared to the non-hypertension group and further verified this finding using a statistical t-test. Finally, when applying our method on patients with vascular disease, we observed that the overall probability of lesions is significantly higher in later age groups, which is in line with the current literature.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359730","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.10.042"

METHODS AND RESULTS: We used data on 490,852 participants from the UK Biobank, with linkage to national mortality data between 2006 and 2016. Using Cox regression, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality within body mass index categories in people with and without diabetes adjusting for potential confounders. 24,789 (5.0%) participants reported having diabetes at baseline. Over a median follow-up of 6.9 years, 13,896 participants died, of which 1800 had diabetes. Compared with normal body mass index (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)), mortality risk in the overweight group (25.0-29.9 kg/m(2)) was 33% lower in people with diabetes (HR 0.67, 95%CI 0.62-0.73) and 12% lower in participants without (HR 0.88, 95%CI 0.85-0.90). For class I obesity (30.0-34.9 kg/m(2)), mortality risk was 35% lower in participants with diabetes (HR 0.65, 95%CI 0.59-0.71) and 5% lower in participants without (HR 0.95, 95%CI 0.91-0.99). For class III obesity (>/=40 kg/m(2)), there was a 10% non-significant lower mortality risk compared to normal body mass index in people with diabetes (HR 0.90, 95%CI 0.77-1.05); in contrast, the risk was 29% higher in people without diabetes (HR 1.29, 95%CI 1.13-1.45). Similar patterns were observed for cardiovascular mortality but not for cancer mortality. CONCLUSION: The impact of obesity on the risk of mortality was dependent on the presence of diabetes: for the same level of obesity, mortality risk was higher in people without diabetes compared to those with diabetes.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30309720","10.1016/j.numecd.2018.07.007"

METHODS: Participants had nonmydriatic SD OCT (Topcon 3D OCT-1000 Mark II; Topcon GB, Newberry, Berkshire, UK) performed as part of the ocular assessment module. Rapid, remote, automated segmentation of the images was performed using custom optical coherence tomography (OCT) image analysis software (Topcon Advanced Boundary Segmentation [TABS]; Topcon GB) to generate macular thickness values. We excluded people with a history of ocular or systemic disease (diabetes or neurodegenerative diseases) and eyes with reduced vision (<0.1 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) or with low SD OCT signal-to-noise ratio and low segmentation success certainty. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Macular thickness values across 9 Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfields. RESULTS: The SD OCT scans of 67 321 subjects were available for analysis, with 32 062 people with at least 1 eye meeting the inclusion criteria. There were 17 274 women and 14 788 men, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 55.2 (8.2) years. The mean (SD) logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity was -0.075 (0.087), and the refractive error was -0.071 (+1.91) diopters (D).

PARTICIPANTS: We included 110 573 participants from the UK Biobank with intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements available. Their mean age was 57 years (range, 40-69 years); 54% were women, and 90% were white. METHODS: Participants had 1 IOP measurement made on each eye using the Ocular Response Analyzer noncontact tonometer. Linear regression models were used to assess the associations of IOP with physical and demographic factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The IOPg and IOPcc. RESULTS: The mean IOPg was 15.72 mmHg (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.70-15.74 mmHg), and the mean IOPcc was 15.95 mmHg (15.92-15.97 mmHg). After adjusting for covariates, IOPg and IOPcc were both significantly associated with older age, male sex, higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), faster heart rate, greater myopia, self-reported glaucoma, and colder season (all P < 0.001). The strongest determinants of both IOPg and IOPcc were SBP (partial R(2): IOPg 2.30%, IOPcc 2.26%), followed by refractive error (IOPg 0.60%, IOPcc 1.04%). The following variables had different directions of association with IOPg and IOPcc: height (-0.77 mmHg/m IOPg; 1.03 mmHg/m IOPcc), smoking (0.19 mmHg IOPg, -0.35 mmHg IOPcc), self-reported diabetes (0.41 mmHg IOPg, -0.05 mmHg IOPcc), and black ethnicity (-0.80 mmHg IOPg, 0.77 mmHg IOPcc). This suggests that height, smoking, diabetes, and ethnicity are related to corneal biomechanical properties. The increase in both IOPg and IOPcc with age was greatest among those of mixed ethnicities, followed by blacks and whites. The same set of covariates explained 7.4% of the variability of IOPcc but only 5.3% of the variability of IOPg. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of associations with IOP in a large cohort demonstrated that some variables clearly have different associations with IOPg and IOPcc, and that these 2 measurements may reflect different biological characteristics.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26795295","10.1016/j.ophtha.2015.11.031"

DESIGN: Multisite community-based study. This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-seven thousand three hundred eighteen people 40 to 69 years old received questionnaires, physical examination, and eye examination, including macular SD OCT. Systematic selection process identified 34 652 eyes with high-quality SD OCT images from normal individuals for analysis. METHODS: We included people with no self-reported ocular disease, diabetes, or neurologic disorders; visual acuity of >/=20/25; refraction between -6 diopters (D) to 6 D, and IOP of 6 to 21 mmHg. Only high-quality, well-centered SD OCT images with central, stable fixation were included. Descriptive statistics, t tests, and regression analyses were performed. Multivariate regression modeling was used to adjust for covariates and to identify relationships between RPE-BM thickness and ocular and systemic features. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Retinal pigment epithelium-BM thickness, as measured by SD OCT segmentation using Topcon Advanced Boundary Segmentation at 9 Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study subfields. RESULTS: Mean RPE-BM thickness was 26.3 mum (standard deviation, 4.8 mum) at central subfield. Multivariate regression with age stratification showed that RPE thinning became apparent after age 45. Among those aged </=45, RPE-BM was significantly thicker among those of black or mixed/other race (+3.61 and +1.77 mum vs. white, respectively; P < 0.001) and higher hyperopia (+0.4 mum/D; P < 0.001), but not for other variables considered. Among those age >45, RPE-BM was significantly thinner with older age (-0.10 mum/year; P < 0.001), Asian ethnicity (-0.45 mum vs. white; P = 0.02), taller height (-0.02 mum/cm; P < 0.001), higher IOP (-0.03 mum/mmHg; P < 0.001), and regular smoking (-0.27 mum vs. nonsmokers; P = 0.02).

There was no significant association with sex or Chinese ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: We describe novel findings of RPE-BM thickness in normal individuals, a structure that varies with age, ethnicity, refraction, IOP, and smoking. The significant association with IOP is especially interesting and may have relevance for the etiology of glaucoma, while the association between age and smoking may have relevance for the etiology of age-related macular degeneration.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27720551","10.1016/j.ophtha.2016.07.033"

This relationship might play a role in the predisposition toward obesity. Neuroticism and executive function seem to be particularly involved, and reduced executive function has been proposed to underlie the association of neuroticism with sedentary behaviors and fatty food consumption. Despite the link between neuroticism, cognitive functions and obesity has been largely reported, conflicting evidence exists. Moreover, information regarding other cognitive domains, and studies on overweight individuals, are still scarce. METHODS: We examined cross-sectional associations of neuroticism and cognitive function with overweight and obesity in a sample of 170 310 individuals from the UK Biobank cohort, adjusted for sociodemographic and life-style factors. Measures on fluid intelligence (FI) (reasoning ability), trail making test (TMT) (executive function), numeric memory test and pairs matching (PM) task (short-term memory) were extracted from the database. Correlations between neuroticism and cognitive performance were explored. Moreover, we investigated whether neuroticism and executive function could predict BMI variability over time. RESULTS: Reduced FI and short-term memory were associated with overweight and obesity, while reduced executive function was associated with obesity but not with overweight. Low neuroticism was associated with being overweight rather than lean or obese independently of gender and life-style. Furthermore, baseline neuroticism scores could predict BMI variations over 5-10 years follow-up, and high neuroticism correlated with lower cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: Lower cognitive performance is associated with both overweight and obesity, except for executive function, which was only related to obesity. Neuroticism correlated with performance on most of the cognitive domains tested, supporting the link between personality and cognition. Our findings also support the role of neuroticism in leading to greater weight variability over time, rather than to overweight/obesity itself.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30469083","10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.11.014"

We conducted the largest examination of this association to date through analysis of the UK Biobank, a large population-based sample of adults aged 40-69 years. We also sought to determine associations between cognitive performance and self-reported chronotype, sleep medication use and sleep duration. METHODS: This cross-sectional, population-based study involved 477,529 participants, comprising 133,314 patients with frequent insomnia symptoms (age: 57.4 +/- 7.7 years; 62.1% female) and 344,215 controls without insomnia symptoms (age: 56.1 +/- 8.2 years; 52.0% female). Cognitive performance was assessed by a touchscreen test battery probing reasoning, basic reaction time, numeric memory, visual memory, and prospective memory. Adjusted models included relevant demographic, clinical, and sleep variables. RESULTS: Frequent insomnia symptoms were associated with cognitive impairment in unadjusted models; however, these effects were reversed after full adjustment, leaving those with frequent insomnia symptoms showing statistically better cognitive performance over those without. Relative to intermediate chronotype, evening chronotype was associated with superior task performance, while morning chronotype was associated with the poorest performance. Sleep medication use and both long (>9 h) and short (<7 h) sleep durations were associated with impaired performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that after adjustment for potential confounding variables, frequent insomnia symptoms may be associated with a small statistical advantage, which is unlikely to be clinically meaningful, on simple neurocognitive tasks. Further work is required to examine the mechanistic underpinnings of an apparent evening chronotype advantage in cognitive performance and the impairment associated with morning chronotype, sleep medication use, and sleep duration extremes.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031762","10.1016/j.sleep.2017.07.001"

This study aimed to determine whether changes in commute mode are associated with differences in the severity of depressive symptoms in working adults. Commuters were selected from the UK Biobank cohort if they completed >/=2 assessment centre visits between 2006 and 2016. Modes of travel to work were self-reported at each visit. Participants were categorised as 'inactive' (car only) or 'active' commuters (any other mode(s), including walking, cycling and public transport). Transitions between categories were defined between pairs of visits. The severity of depressive symptoms was defined using the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). Scores were derived between zero and six. Higher values indicate more severe symptoms. Separate analyses were conducted in commuters who were asymptomatic (zero score) and symptomatic (non-zero score) at baseline. The analytical sample comprised 5474 participants aged 40-75 at baseline with a mean follow-up of 4.65years. Asymptomatic commuters who transitioned from inactive to active commuting reported less severe symptoms at follow-up than those who remained inactive (beta -0.10, 95% CI [-0.20, 0.00]; N=3145). A similar but non-significant relationship is evident among commuters with pre-existing symptoms (beta -0.60, 95% CI [-1.27, 0.08]; N=1078). After adjusting for transition category, longer commutes at baseline were associated with worse depressive symptoms at follow-up among symptomatic participants. Shifting from exclusive car use towards more active commuting may help prevent and attenuate depressive symptoms in working adults.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29604327","10.1016/j.ypmed.2018.03.018"

Recorded activity was assessed using wrist-worn accelerometers (2013-2015, n=65,967) and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), walking, and walking for pleasure was self-reported (2006-2010, n=337,822). Associations were assessed using linear and multinomial logistic regression models and data were analyzed in 2017. We found participants living in areas with higher concentrations of air pollution recorded and reported lower levels of physical activity and those in rural areas and more walkable areas had higher levels of both recorded and reported activity. Some associations varied according to the specificity of the outcome, for example, those living in the most deprived areas were less likely to record higher levels of MVPA (upper tertile: RRR: 0.80 95% CI: 0.74, 0.86) but were more likely to report higher levels of walking (upper tertile: RRR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.13).

We investigated predictors of mortality in UK Biobank participants during a 5 year period. We aimed to investigate the associations between most of the available measurements and 5 year all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and to develop and validate a prediction score for 5 year mortality using only self-reported information. METHODS: Participants were enrolled in the UK Biobank from April, 2007, to July, 2010, from 21 assessment centres across England, Wales, and Scotland with standardised procedures. In this prospective population-based study, we assessed sex-specific associations of 655 measurements of demographics, health, and lifestyle with all-cause mortality and six cause-specific mortality categories in UK Biobank participants using the Cox proportional hazard model. We excluded variables that were missing in more than 80% of the participants and all cardiorespiratory fitness test measurements because summary data were not available. Validation of the prediction score was done in participants enrolled at the Scottish centres. UK life tables and census information were used to calibrate the score to the overall UK population. FINDINGS: About 500,000 participants were included in the UK Biobank. We excluded participants with more than 80% variables missing (n=746). Of 498,103 UK Biobank participants included (54% of whom were women) aged 37-73 years, 8532 (39% of whom were women) died during a median follow-up of 4.9 years (IQR 4.33-5.22). Self-reported health (C-index including age 0.74 [95% CI 0.73-0.75]) was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in men and a previous cancer diagnosis (0.73 [0.72-0.74]) was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in women. When excluding individuals with major diseases or disorders (Charlson comorbidity index >0; n=355 043), measures of smoking habits were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality. The prognostic score including 13 self-reported predictors for men and 11 for women achieved good discrimination (0.80 [0.77-0.83] for men and 0.79 [0.76-0.83] for women) and significantly outperformed the Charlson comorbidity index (p<0.0001 in men and p=0.0007 in women). A dedicated website allows the interactive exploration of all results along with calculation of individual risk through an online questionnaire. INTERPRETATION: Measures that can simply be obtained by questionnaires and without physical examination were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality in the UK Biobank population. The prediction score we have developed accurately predicts 5 year all-cause mortality and can be used by individuals to improve health awareness, and by health professionals and organisations to identify high-risk individuals and guide public policy.

We used UK Biobank data to study the genetic causes of smoking behaviour and lung health. Methods We sampled individuals of European ancestry from UK Biobank, from the middle and extremes of the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) distribution among heavy smokers (mean 35 pack-years) and never smokers. We developed a custom array for UK Biobank to provide optimum genome-wide coverage of common and low-frequency variants, dense coverage of genomic regions already implicated in lung health and disease, and to assay rare coding variants relevant to the UK population. We investigated whether there were shared genetic causes between different phenotypes defined by extremes of FEV1. We also looked for novel variants associated with extremes of FEV1 and smoking behaviour and assessed regions of the genome that had already shown evidence for a role in lung health and disease. We set genome-wide significance at p<5 x 10(-8). Findings UK Biobank participants were recruited from March 15, 2006, to July 7, 2010. Sample selection for the UK BiLEVE study started on Nov 22, 2012, and was completed on Dec 20, 2012. We selected 50 008 unique samples: 10 002 individuals with low FEV1, 10 000 with average FEV1, and 5002 with high FEV1 from each of the heavy smoker and never smoker groups. We noted a substantial sharing of genetic causes of low FEV1 between heavy smokers and never smokers (p=2 . 29 x 10(-16)) and between individuals with and without doctor-diagnosed asthma (p=6 . 06 x 10(-11)). We discovered six novel genome-wide significant signals of association with extremes of FEV1, including signals at four novel loci (KANSL1, TSEN54, TET2, and RBM19/TBX5) and independent signals at two previously reported loci (NPNT and HLA-DQB1/HLA-DQA2). These variants also showed association with COPD, including in individuals with no history of smoking. The number of copies of a 150 kb region containing the 5' end of KANSL1, a gene that is important for epigenetic gene regulation, was associated with extremes of FEV1. We also discovered five new genome-wide significant signals for smoking behaviour, including a variant in NCAM1 (chromosome 11) and a variant on chromosome 2 (between TEX41 and PABPC1P2) that has a trans effect on expression of NCAM1 in brain tissue. Interpretation By sampling from the extremes of the lung function distribution in UK Biobank, we identified novel genetic causes of lung function and smoking behaviour. These results provide new insight into the specific mechanisms underlying airflow obstruction, COPD, and tobacco addiction, and show substantial shared genetic architecture underlying airflow obstruction across individuals, irrespective of smoking behaviour and other airway disease.","<Go to ISI>://WOS:000362452900021","10.1016/s2213-2600(15)00283-0"

METHODS: Cross-sectional, observational data from UK Biobank were used. These were collected from individuals aged 40-69 years who visited 22 assessment centres across the UK between 2006 and 2010. Self-reported commuting method was operationalised into seven categories, ordered to reflect typical levels of physical exertion. The outcomes assessed were BMI (based on objectively measured weight and height) and percentage body fat. Hypothesised confounders were income, area deprivation, urban or rural residence, education, alcohol intake, smoking, leisure physical activity, recreational walking, occupational physical activity, general health, and limiting illness or disability. We used sex-stratified multivariate linear-regression models. FINDINGS: Final complete case sample sizes were 72 999 men and 83 667 women for the BMI outcome and 72 139 men and 82 788 women for the percentage body fat outcome. Active commuting was significantly and independently associated with reduced BMI and percentage body fat for both sexes, with a graded pattern apparent across the seven commuting categories. In fully adjusted models, compared with their car-only counterparts, mixed public and active transport commuters had significantly lower BMI (men: beta coefficient -1.00 kg/m(2) [95% CI -1.14 to -0.87], p<0.0001; women: -0.67 kg/m(2) [-0.86 to -0.47], p<0.0001), as did cycling or cycling and walking commuters (men: -1.71 kg/m(2) [95% CI -1.86 to -1.56], p<0.0001; women: -1.65 kg/m(2) [-1.92 to -1.38], p<0.0001). Similarly, compared with car-only commuters, mixed public transport and active commuters had significantly lower percentage body fat (men: -1.32% [95% CI -1.53 to -1.12], p<0.0001; women: -1.10% [-1.40 to -0.81], p<0.0001), as did cycling or cycling and walking commuters (men: -2.75% [95% CI -3.03 to -2.48], p<0.0001; women: -3.26% [-3.80 to -2.71], p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: This study is the first to use UK Biobank data to address the topic of active commuting and obesity and shows robust, independent associations between active commuting and healthier bodyweight and composition. These findings support the case for interventions to promote active travel as a population-level policy response for prevention of obesity in mid-life.

Genetic susceptibility to young-onset type 1 diabetes is well defined and does not predispose to type 2 diabetes. It is not known how frequently genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes leads to a diagnosis of diabetes after age 30 years. We aimed to investigate the frequency and phenotype of type 1 diabetes resulting from high genetic susceptibility in the first six decades of life. METHODS: In this cross-sectional analysis, we used a type 1 diabetes genetic risk score based on 29 common variants to identify individuals of white European descent in UK Biobank in the half of the population with high or low genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to evaluate the number of cases of diabetes in both groups in the first six decades of life. We genetically defined type 1 diabetes as the additional cases of diabetes that occurred in the high genetic susceptibility group compared with the low genetic susceptibility group. All remaining cases were defined as type 2 diabetes. We assessed the clinical characteristics of the groups with genetically defined type 1 or type 2 diabetes. FINDINGS: 13 250 (3.5%) of 379 511 white European individuals in UK Biobank had developed diabetes in the first six decades of life. 1286 more cases of diabetes were in the half of the population with high genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes than in the half of the population with low genetic susceptibility. These genetically defined cases of type 1 diabetes were distributed across all ages of diagnosis; 537 (42%) were in individuals diagnosed when aged 31-60 years, representing 4% (537/12 233) of all diabetes cases diagnosed after age 30 years. The clinical characteristics of the group diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when aged 31-60 years were similar to the clinical characteristics of the group diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when aged 30 years or younger. For individuals diagnosed with diabetes when aged 31-60 years, the clinical characteristics of type 1 diabetes differed from those of type 2 diabetes: they had a lower BMI (27.4 kg/m(2) [95% CI 26.7-28.0] vs 32.4 kg/m(2) [32.2-32.5]; p<0.0001), were more likely to use insulin in the first year after diagnosis (89% [476/537] vs 6% [648/11 696]; p<0.0001), and were more likely to have diabetic ketoacidosis (11% [61/537] vs 0.3% [30/11 696]; p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes results in non-obesity-related, insulin-dependent diabetes, which presents throughout the first six decades of life. Our results highlight the difficulty of identifying type 1 diabetes after age 30 years because of the increasing background prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Failure to diagnose late-onset type 1 diabetes can have serious consequences because these patients rapidly develop insulin dependency.

Previous studies in this area have used subjective reports of activity and sleep patterns, but the availability of accelerometer-based data from UK Biobank participants permits the derivation and analysis of new, objectively ascertained circadian rhythmicity parameters. We examined associations between objectively assessed circadian rhythmicity and mental health and wellbeing phenotypes, including lifetime history of mood disorder. METHODS: UK residents aged 37-73 years were recruited into the UK Biobank general population cohort from 2006 to 2010. We used data from a subset of participants whose activity levels were recorded by wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer for 7 days. From these data, we derived a circadian relative amplitude variable, which is a measure of the extent to which circadian rhythmicity of rest-activity cycles is disrupted. In the same sample, we examined cross-sectional associations between low relative amplitude and mood disorder, wellbeing, and cognitive variables using a series of regression models. Our final model adjusted for age and season at the time that accelerometry started, sex, ethnic origin, Townsend deprivation score, smoking status, alcohol intake, educational attainment, overall mean acceleration recorded by accelerometry, body-mass index, and a binary measure of childhood trauma. FINDINGS: We included 91 105 participants with accelerometery data collected between 2013 and 2015 in our analyses. A one-quintile reduction in relative amplitude was associated with increased risk of lifetime major depressive disorder (odds ratio [OR] 1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.08) and lifetime bipolar disorder (1.11, 1.03-1.20), as well as with greater mood instability (1.02, 1.01-1.04), higher neuroticism scores (incident rate ratio 1.01, 1.01-1.02), more subjective loneliness (OR 1.09, 1.07-1.11), lower happiness (0.91, 0.90-0.93), lower health satisfaction (0.90, 0.89-0.91), and slower reaction times (linear regression coefficient 1.75, 1.05-2.45). These associations were independent of demographic, lifestyle, education, and overall activity confounders. INTERPRETATION: Circadian disruption is reliably associated with various adverse mental health and wellbeing outcomes, including major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Lower relative amplitude might be linked to increased susceptibility to mood disorders.

Active travel to work has declined in high-income countries in recent decades. We aimed to determine which socioeconomic and demographic characteristics predicted switching to or from active commuting, whether switching from passive to active commuting (or the reverse) independently predicts change in objectively measured body-mass index (BMI), and to ascertain whether any association is attenuated by socioeconomic, demographic, or behavioural factors. METHODS: This study used longitudinal data from UK Biobank. Baseline data collection occurred at 22 centres between March, 2006, and July, 2010, with a repeat assessment at one centre (Stockport) between August, 2012, and June, 2013, for a subset of these participants. Height and weight were objectively measured at both timepoints. We included individuals present at both timepoints with complete data in the analytic sample. Participants were aged 40-69 years and commuted from home to a workplace on a regular basis at both baseline and follow-up. Two exposures were investigated: transition from car commuting to active or public transport commuting and transition from active or public transport to car commuting. Change in BMI between baseline and repeat assessment was the outcome of interest, assessed with bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models. FINDINGS: 502 656 individuals provided baseline data, with 20 346 participating in the repeat assessment after a median of 4.4 years (IQR 3.7-4.9). 5861 individuals were present at both timepoints and had complete data for all analytic variables. Individuals who transitioned from car commuting at baseline to active or public transportation modes at follow-up had a decrease in BMI of -0.30 kg/m(2) (95% CI -0.47 to -0.13; p=0.0005). Conversely, individuals who transitioned from active commuting at baseline to car commuting at follow-up had a BMI increase of 0.32 kg/m(2) (0.13 to 0.50; p=0.008). These effects were not attenuated by adjustment for hypothesised confounders. Change in household income emerged as a determinant of commute mode transitions. INTERPRETATION: Incorporation of increased levels of physical activity as part of the commute to work could reduce obesity among middle-aged adults in the UK.

We sought to identify risk factors that might explain the increased mortality in socially isolated and lonely individuals. METHODS: We used prospective follow-up data from the UK Biobank cohort study to assess self-reported isolation (a three-item scale) and loneliness (two questions). The main outcomes were all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We calculated the percentage of excess risk mediated by risk factors to assess the extent to which the associations of social isolation and loneliness with mortality were attributable to differences between isolated and lonely individuals and others in biological (body-mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and handgrip strength), behavioural (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity), socioeconomic (education, neighbourhood deprivation, and household income), and psychological (depressive symptoms and cognitive capacity) risk factors. FINDINGS: 466 901 men and women (mean age at baseline 56.5 years [SD 8.1]) were included in the analyses, with a mean follow-up of 6.5 years (SD 0.8). The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality for social isolation compared with no social isolation was 1.73 (95% CI 1.65-1.82) after adjustment for age, sex, ethnic origin, and chronic disease (ie, minimally adjusted), and was 1.26 (95% CI 1.20-1.33) after further adjustment for socioeconomic factors, health-related behaviours, depressive symptoms, biological factors, cognitive performance, and self-rated health (ie, fully adjusted). The minimally adjusted hazard ratio for mortality risk related to loneliness was 1.38 (95% CI 1.30-1.47), which reduced to 0.99 (95% CI 0.93-1.06) after full adjustment for baseline risks. INTERPRETATION: Isolated and lonely people are at increased risk of death. Health policies addressing risk factors such as adverse socioeconomic conditions, unhealthy lifestyle, and lower mental wellbeing might reduce excess mortality among the isolated and the lonely.

Participants were aged 40-70 years and attended 21 assessment centres between 2006 and 2010. Using linked data on environments around each participant's residential address, we examined whether density of physical activity facilities and proximity to fast-food outlets were associated with waist circumference, body-mass index (BMI), and body fat percentage. We used multilevel linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders, and conducted several sensitivity analyses.///Findings Complete case sample sizes were 401 917 (waist circumference models), 401 435 (BMI), and 395 640 (body fat percentage). Greater density of physical activity facilities within 1000 m of home was independently associated with smaller waist circumference and lower BMI and body fat percentage. Compared with people with no nearby facilities, those with at least six facilities close to home had 1.22 cm smaller waist circumference (95% CI-1.64 to -0.80), 0.57 kg/m(2) lower BMI (-0.74 to -0.39), and 0.81 percentage points lower body fat (-1.03 to -0.59). Living further from a fast-food outlet was weakly associated with waist circumference and BMI, mostly among women. Compared with people living fewer than 500 m from a fast-food outlet, those living at least 2000 m away had 0.26 cm smaller waist circumference (-0.52 to 0.01).///Interpretation This study shows strong associations between high densities of physical activity facilities and lower adiposity for adults in mid-life. We observed weaker associations for access to fast food, but these are likely to be underestimated owing to limitations of the food environment measure.

This paper aims to examine the association between frailty, multimorbidity, specific long-term conditions, and mortality in a middle-aged and older aged population. METHODS: Data were sourced from the UK Biobank. Frailty phenotype was based on five criteria (weight loss, exhaustion, grip strength, low physical activity, slow walking pace). Participants were deemed frail if they met at least three criteria, pre-frail if they fulfilled one or two criteria, and not frail if no criteria were met. Sociodemographic characteristics and long-term conditions were examined. The outcome was all-cause mortality, which was measured at a median of 7 years follow-up. Multinomial logistic regression compared sociodemographic characteristics and long-term conditions of frail or pre-frail participants with non-frail participants. Cox proportional hazards models examined associations between frailty or pre-frailty and mortality. Results were stratified by age group (37-45, 45-55, 55-65, 65-73 years) and sex, and were adjusted for multimorbidity count, socioeconomic status, body-mass index, smoking status, and alcohol use. FINDINGS: 493 737 participants aged 37-73 years were included in the study, of whom 16 538 (3%) were considered frail, 185 360 (38%) pre-frail, and 291 839 (59%) not frail. Frailty was significantly associated with multimorbidity (prevalence 18% [4435/25 338] in those with four or more long-term conditions; odds ratio [OR] 27.1, 95% CI 25.3-29.1) socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity, and infrequent alcohol consumption. The top five long-term conditions associated with frailty were multiple sclerosis (OR 15.3; 99.75% CI 12.8-18.2); chronic fatigue syndrome (12.9; 11.1-15.0); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5.6; 5.2-6.1); connective tissue disease (5.4; 5.0-5.8); and diabetes (5.0; 4.7-5.2). Pre-frailty and frailty were significantly associated with mortality for all age strata in men and women (except in women aged 37-45 years) after adjustment for confounders. INTERPRETATION: Efforts to identify, manage, and prevent frailty should include middle-aged individuals with multimorbidity, in whom frailty is significantly associated with mortality, even after adjustment for number of long-term conditions, sociodemographics, and lifestyle.

Combinations of traditional factors such as smoking and alcohol are well described, but the additional effects of emerging factors such as television viewing time are not. The effect of socioeconomic deprivation on these extended lifestyle risks also remains unclear. We aimed to examine whether deprivation modifies the association between an extended score of lifestyle-related risk factors and health outcomes.///Methods Data for this prospective analysis were sourced from the UK Biobank, a prospective population-based cohort study. We assigned all participants an extended lifestyle score, with 1 point for each unhealthy lifestyle factor (incorporating sleep duration and high television viewing time, in addition to smoking, excessive alcohol, poor diet [low intake of oily fish or fruits and vegetables, and high intake of red meat or processed meats], and low physical activity), categorised as most healthy (score 0-2), moderately healthy (score 3-5), or least healthy (score 6-9). Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between lifestyle score and health outcomes (all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality and incidence), and whether this association was modified by deprivation. All analyses were landmark analyses, in which participants were excluded if they had an event (death or cardiovascular disease event) within 2 years of recruitment. Participants with non-communicable diseases (except hypertension) and missing covariate data were excluded from analyses. Participants were also excluded if they reported implausible values for physical activity, sleep duration, and total screen time. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, month of assessment, history of hypertension, systolic blood pressure, medication for hypercholesterolaemia or hypertension, and body-mass index categories.///Findings 328 594 participants aged 40-69 years were included in the study, with a mean follow-up period of 4.9 years (SD 0.83) after the landmark period for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, and 4.1 years (0.81) for cardiovascular disease incidence. In the least deprived quintile, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) in the least healthy lifestyle category, compared with the most healthy category, was 1.65 (95% CI 1.25-2.19) for all-cause mortality, 1.93 (1.16-3.20) for cardiovascular disease mortality, and 1.29 (1.10-1.52) for cardiovascular disease incidence. Equivalent HRs in the most deprived quintile were 2.47 (95% CI 2.04-3.00), 3.36 (2.36-4.76), and 1.41 (1.25-1.60), respectively. The HR for trend for one increment change towards least healthy in the least deprived quintile compared with that in the most deprived quintile was 1.25 (95% CI 1.12-1.39) versus 1.55 (1.40-1.70) for all-cause mortality, 1.30 (1.05-1.61) versus 1.83 (1.54-2.18) for cardiovascular disease mortality, and 1.10 (1.04-1.17) versus 1.16 (1.09-1.23) for cardiovascular disease incidence. A significant interaction was found between lifestyle and deprivation for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality (both p(interaction)<0001), but not for cardiovascular disease incidence (p(interaction) n=0.11).///interpretation Wide combinations of lifestyle factors are associated with disproportionate harm in deprived populations.

However, the evidence for identifying the optimum residential density in relation to obesity has been far from compelling. We examined the association of obesity with residential density in a large and diverse population sample drawn from the UK Biobank to identify healthy-weight-sustaining density environments. Methods For this full-data, cross-sectional analysis, we used UK Biobank data for adult men and women aged 37-73 years from 22 cities across the UK. Baseline examinations were done between 2006 and 2010. Residential unit density was objectively assessed within a 1 km street catchment of a participant's residence. Other activity-influencing built environment factors were measured in terms of density of retail, public transport, and street-level movement density, which were modelled from network analyses of through movement of street links within the defined catchment. We regressed adiposity indicators of body-mass index (BMI; kg/m<sup>2</sup>), waist circumference (cm), whole body fat (kg), and obesity (WHO criteria of BMI >=30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) on residential density (units per km<sup>2</sup>), adjusting for activity-influencing built environment factors and individual covariates. We also investigated effect modification by age, sex, employment status, and physical activity. We used a series of linear continuous and logistic regression models and non-linear restricted cubic spline models as appropriate. Findings Of 502 649 adults in the prospective cohort, 419 562 (83.5%) participants across 22 UK Biobank assessment centres met baseline data requirements and were included in the analytic sample. The fitted restricted cubic spline adiposity-residential density dose-response curve identified a turning point at a residential density of 1800 residential units per km<sup>2</sup>. Below a residential density of 1800 units per km<sup>2</sup>, an increment of 1000 units per km<sup>2</sup> was positively related with adiposity, being associated with higher BMI (beta 0.19 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.24), waist circumference (beta 0.41 cm, 0.28 to 0.54), and whole body fat (beta 0.40 kg, 0.30 to 0.50), and with increased odds of obesity (odds ratio [OR] 1.10, 1.07 to 1.14). Beyond 1800 units per km<sup>2</sup>, residential density had a protective effect on adiposity and was associated with lower BMI (beta -0.22 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, -0.25 to -0.20), waist circumference (beta -0.54 cm, -0.61 to -0.48), and whole body fat (beta -0.38 kg, -0.43 to -0.33), and with decreased odds of obesity (OR 0.91, 0.90 to 0.93). Subgroup analyses identified more pronounced protective effects of residential density among individuals who were younger, female, in employment, and accumulating higher levels of physical activity, except in the case of whole body fat, for which the protective effects were stronger in men. Interpretation Housing-level policy related to the optimisation of healthy density in cities might be a potential upstream-level public health intervention towards the minimisation and offsetting of obesity; however, further research based on accumulated prospective data is necessary for evidencing specific pathways. The findings might mean that governments, such as the UK Government, who are attempting to prevent suburban densification by, for example, prohibiting the subdivision of single lot housing and the conversion of domestic gardens to housing lots, will potentially have the effect of inhibiting the conversion of suburbs into more healthy places to live.

Residential greenness, a fundamental component of urban design, has been shown to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders. The present study investigates the association between residential green exposure and prevalence of major depressive disorders using a large and diverse cross-sectional dataset from the UK Biobank. METHODS: In this cross-sectional, observational, associational study, we used baseline data from the UK Biobank cohort of participants aged 37-73 years from across the UK. Environmental exposure data were derived from a modelled and linked built environment database. Residential greenness was assessed with a 0.5 m resolution Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, which is derived from spectral reflectance measurements in remotely sensed colour infrared data and measured within geocoded dwelling catchments. Other environment metrics included street-level movement density, terrain, and fine particulate exposures. A series of logistic models examined associations between residential greenness and odds of major depressive disorder after adjusting for activity-influencing environments and individual covariates. FINDINGS: Of 122 993 participants with data on major depressive disorder, the study analytical sample comprised 94 879 (77.1%) participants recruited across ten UK Biobank assessment centres between April 29, 2009, and Oct 1, 2010. A protective effect of greenness on depression was consistently observed, with 4.0% lower odds of major depressive disorder per interquartile increment in Normalised Difference Vegetation Index greenness (odds ratio 0.960, 95% CI 0.93-0.99; p=0.0044). Interaction analyses indicated that the beneficial effects of greenness were more pronounced among women, participants younger than 60 years, and participants residing in areas with low neighbourhood socioeconomic status or high urbanicity. INTERPRETATION: The results point to the benefits of well designed green environments on mental health. Further longitudinal studies are needed to decipher causal pathways. In the UK, policies aimed at optimising allocation and design of green spaces might help preserve psychological ecosystem services, thereby, improving the mental wellbeing of populations and enhancing the mental capital of cities.

The effect of ready-to-eat food environments that sell food for instant consumption on the risk of type 2 diabetes has received scant attention. We therefore aimed to examine the association between exposure to ready-to-eat food environments and type 2 diabetes in a large and diverse population sample. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult male and female participants from the baseline phase of the UK Biobank cohort. Participants in this cohort were aged 37-73 years and resided in one of 21 cities in the UK. Ready-to-eat food environments, which we determined from a modelled and linked built environment database, were objectively measured within 1-km catchment areas of the residential streets of participants and were expressed as metrics of density and proximity to the participants' homes. We used logistic regression models to examine the associations between exposure to ready-to-eat food environments and the odds of type 2 diabetes, adjusting for individual covariates such as physical activity. As sensitivity analyses, we investigated the associations between the street distance to the nearest ready-to-eat food outlet and type 2 diabetes. We also tested post hoc for effect modification by sex, income, body-mass index, and location of the UK Biobank collection centre. FINDINGS: Of 502 635 UK Biobank participants enrolled between March 13, 2006, and Oct 1, 2010, the sample analysed included 347 551 (69.1%) participants. The density of ready-to-eat food environments within a 1-km catchment area was associated with higher odds of type 2 diabetes for participants in the groups with highest exposure to restaurants and cafeterias (odss ratio 1.129, 95% CI 1.05-1.21; p=0.0007) and a composite measure of ready-to-eat outlet density (1.112, 1.02-1.21; p=0.0134) compared with those with no exposure. Exposure to hot and cold takeaways was only significantly associated with higher odds of type 2 diabetes at the second highest exposure category that we examined (1.076, 1.01-1.14; p=0.0171), representing a density of 0.75-2.15 units per km(2). A protective effect with distance decay was observed: participants in the highest quintile of street distance to nearest ready-to-eat food outlet reported lower odds of type 2 diabetes than those in the lowest quintile (0.842, 0.78-0.91; p<0.0001 for restaurants and cafeterias; and 0.913, 0.85-0.98; p=0.0173 for hot and cold takeaways). These effects were most pronounced in overweight participants (p=0.0329), but there was no evidence of interaction by sex, income, or UK Biobank collection centre. INTERPRETATION: Access to ready-to-eat food environments was positively associated with type 2 diabetes. Top-down policies aimed at minimising unhealthy food access could potentially reduce unhealthy consumption and risks of chronic diseases. Further long-term studies are needed to effectively guide such interventions.

This study reports on the acceptability of repeated web-based administration of the Oxford WebQ--a 24-h recall of frequency from a set food list suitable for self-completion from which energy and nutrient values can be automatically generated. As part of the UK Biobank study, four invitations to complete the Oxford WebQ were sent by email over a 16-month period. Overall, 176 012 (53% of those invited) participants completed the online version of the Oxford WebQ at least once and 66% completed it more than once, although only 16% completed it on all four occasions. The response rate for any one round of invitations varied between 34 and 26%. On most occasions, the Oxford WebQ was completed on the same day that they received the invitation, although this was less likely if sent on a weekend. Participants who completed the Oxford WebQ tended to be white, female, slightly older, less deprived and more educated, which is typical of health-conscious volunteer-based studies.

As this 'season of birth' effect underpins some of the most influential hypotheses concerning potentially modifiable risk exposures, it is important to exclude other possible explanations for the phenomenon. METHODS: Here we sought to determine whether the season of birth effect reflects gene-environment confounding rather than a pathogenic process indexing environmental exposure. We directly measured, in 136 538 participants from the UK Biobank (UKBB), the burdens of common schizophrenia risk alleles and of copy number variants known to increase the risk for the disorder, and tested whether these were correlated with a season of birth. RESULTS: Neither genetic measure was associated with season or month of birth within the UKBB sample. CONCLUSIONS: As our study was highly powered to detect small effects, we conclude that the season of birth effect in schizophrenia reflects a true pathogenic effect of environmental exposure.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29501066","10.1017/S0033291718000454"

If it were possible to unpick the association between personality and smoking, it may be possible to develop tailored smoking interventions that could lead to both improved uptake and efficacy. METHODS: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified variants robustly associated with both smoking phenotypes and personality traits. Here we use publicly available GWAS summary statistics in addition to individual-level data from UK Biobank to investigate the link between smoking and personality. We first estimate genetic overlap between traits using LD score regression and then use bidirectional Mendelian randomisation methods to unpick the nature of this relationship. RESULTS: We found clear evidence of a modest genetic correlation between smoking behaviours and both neuroticism and extraversion. We found some evidence that personality traits are causally linked to certain smoking phenotypes: among current smokers each additional neuroticism risk allele was associated with smoking an additional 0.07 cigarettes per day (95% CI 0.02-0.12, p = 0.009), and each additional extraversion effect allele was associated with an elevated odds of smoking initiation (OR 1.015, 95% CI 1.01-1.02, p = 9.6 x 10-7). CONCLUSION: We found some evidence for specific causal pathways from personality to smoking phenotypes, and weaker evidence of an association from smoking initiation to personality. These findings could be used to inform future smoking interventions or to tailor existing schemes.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30355388","10.1017/S0033291718003069"

This work identifies demographic, dietary and lifestyle predictors associated with vitamin D supplement use. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline vitamin D supplement use data. SETTING: UK Biobank cohort. SUBJECTS: In total, n 8024 South Asians (Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani), aged 40-69 years. RESULTS: Twenty-three % of men and 39% of women (P<0.001) [22% of Bangladeshis, 32% of Indians, 25% of Pakistanis (P<0.001)] took a vitamin D containing supplement. Median vitamin D intakes from diet were low at 1.0-3.0 micrograms per day, being highest in Bangladeshis and lowest in Indians (P<0.001). Logistic regression modelling showed that females had a higher odds of vitamin D supplement use than males (odds ratio (OR) = 2.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.79 to 2.28). A lower supplement usage was seen in younger persons (40-60 years) (OR=0.75; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.86 reference= >60 years), and those living outside of Greater London (OR=0.53 to 0.77), with borderline trends for a lower body mass index, higher oily fish intake and higher household income associated with increased odds of vitamin D supplement use. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplements were not used by most South Asians and intakes from diet alone are likely to be insufficient to maintain adequate vitamin D status. Public health strategies are now urgently required to promote the use of vitamin D supplements in these specific UK South Asian subgroups.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29936916","10.1017/S1368980018001404"

Polygenic scores were based on published genome-wide association (GWA) results in over 17,000 individuals for the NEO-FFI and in over 63,000 for the IRT extraversion and neuroticism traits. The NEO-FFI polygenic scores were used to predict life satisfaction in 7 cohorts, positive affect in 12 cohorts, and general wellbeing in 1 cohort (maximal N = 46,508). Meta-analysis of these results showed no significant association between NEO-FFI personality polygenic scores and the wellbeing measures. IRT extraversion and neuroticism polygenic scores were used to predict life satisfaction and positive affect in almost 37,000 individuals from UK Biobank. Significant positive associations (effect sizes <0.05%) were observed between the extraversion polygenic score and wellbeing measures, and a negative association was observed between the polygenic neuroticism score and life satisfaction. Furthermore, using GWA data, genetic correlations of -0.49 and -0.55 were estimated between neuroticism with life satisfaction and positive affect, respectively. The moderate genetic correlation between neuroticism and wellbeing is in line with twin research showing that genetic influences on wellbeing are also shared with other independent personality domains.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27546527","10.1017/thg.2016.65"

Exposure data were collected at recruitment. Prostate cancer risk by the different exposures was estimated using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: In all, 4575 incident cases of prostate cancer occurred during 5.6 years of follow-up. Prostate cancer risk was positively associated with the following: black ethnicity (hazard ratio black vs white=2.61, 95% confidence interval=2.10-3.24); having ever had a prostate-specific antigen test (1.31, 1.23-1.40); being diagnosed with an enlarged prostate (1.54, 1.38-1.71); and having a family history of prostate cancer (1.94, 1.77-2.13).

METHODS: Biobank is a study of U.K. residents aged 40-69 years registered with the National Health Service. Data were collected on visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), corneal biomechanics, and questionnaire from 112,690 participants. Relationships between ocular, demographic, and socioeconomic variables with reported diagnosis of glaucoma were examined. RESULTS: In all, 1916 (1.7%) people in U.K. Biobank reported glaucoma diagnosis. Participants reporting glaucoma were more likely to be older (mean 61.4 vs. 56.7 years, P<0.001) and male (2.1% vs. 1.4%, P=0.001). The rate of reported glaucoma was significantly higher in Black (3.28%, P<0.001) and Asian (2.14%, P=0.009) participants compared with White participants (1.62%, reference). Cases of reported glaucoma had a higher mean IOP (18 mm Hg both eyes, P<0.001), lower corneal hysteresis (9.96 right eye, 9.89 left eye, P<0.001), and lower visual acuity (0.09 logMAR right eye, 0.08 logMAR left eye, P<0.001) compared with those without (16 mm Hg both eyes, hysteresis 10.67 right eye, 10.63 left eye, 0.03 logMAR right eye, 0.02 logMAR left eye). The mean Townsend deprivation index was -0.72 for those reporting glaucoma and -0.95 for those without (P<0.001), indicating greater relative deprivation in those reporting glaucoma. Multivariable logistic regression showed that people in the lowest income group (< pound18,000/year) were significantly more likely to report a diagnosis of glaucoma compared with any other income level (P<0.01). We observed increasing glaucoma risk across the full range of income categories, with highest risk among those of lowest income, and no evidence of a threshold effect. CONCLUSIONS: In a large U.K. cohort, individuals reporting glaucoma had more adverse socioeconomic characteristics. Study of the mechanisms explaining these effects may aid our understanding of health inequality and will help inform public health interventions.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26315700","10.1038/eye.2015.157"

The establishment of the UK Biobank provided a unique opportunity to investigate this relationship. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied a sample of UK Biobank participants of White ethnicity aged 40-69 years old who underwent autorefraction (N=91 592) and were classified as myopic (</=-0.75 Dioptres (D)), highly myopic (</=-6.00 D), or non-myopic (>-0.75 D). Self-reported age at diagnosis of past medical conditions was ascertained during an interview with a nurse at a Biobank assessment centre. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for myopia or high myopia associated with a diagnosis before age 17 years of each of nine febrile illnesses, after adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, highest educational qualification, and birth order). RESULTS: Rubella, mumps, and pertussis were associated with myopia: rubella, OR=1.38, 95% CI: 1.03-1.85, P=0.030; mumps, OR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.07-1.64, P=0.010; and pertussis, OR=1.39, 95% CI 1.03-1.87, P=0.029. Measles, rubella, and pertussis were associated with high myopia: measles, OR=1.48, 95% CI: 1.07-2.07, P=0.019; rubella, OR=1.94, 95% CI: 1.12-3.35, P=0.017; and pertussis, OR=2.15, 95% CI: 1.24-3.71, P=0.006. The evidence did not support an interaction between education and febrile illness in explaining the above risks. CONCLUSION: A history of childhood measles, rubella, or pertussis was associated with high myopia, whereas a history of childhood rubella, mumps, or pertussis was associated with any myopia.

METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of 502 664 individuals from the UK Biobank was conducted. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the association of age at menarche, age at first birth, parity and age at menopause with measures of general and central body adiposity, adjusted for age, smoking and socioeconomic status. The association between number of children and body adiposity in men was also assessed. RESULTS: Age at menarche was inversely associated with body mass index (BMI); adjusted mean BMI was 29.0 kg m(-2) in women with menarche before the age of 12 years, compared with 26.5 kg m(-2) in those who had menarche after 14 years of age. Age at first birth was linearly and inversely associated with BMI: 0.16 kg m(-2) lower BMI per year increase in age of first birth. Each additional live birth or child fathered was associated with a 0.22 kg m(-2) higher BMI in women and a 0.14 kg m(-2) higher BMI in men. There was no evidence for an association between age at menopause and BMI. Corresponding associations for other markers of general or abdominal adiposity were similar to those for BMI. Findings were broadly similar in analyses stratified by age, smoking status, socioeconomic status, ethnic background, and history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: In women from a contemporary Western population, earlier age at menarche and age at first birth, and higher number of total live births were associated with higher levels of body adiposity. Prospective evaluations of the association between reproductive health factors, adiposity and the onset of cardiometabolic diseases are needed to assess causality, and to explore the mechanisms involved.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26700411","10.1038/ijo.2015.254"

This study aimed to determine longitudinal associations of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and grip strength (GS) with objectively measured PA. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Data are from the UK Biobank study. At baseline (2006-2010), BMI, WC and GS were objectively measured. At follow-up (2013-2015), a sub-sample of 93 015 participants (52 161 women) wore a tri-axial accelerometer on the dominant wrist for 7 days. Linear regression was performed to investigate longitudinal associations of standardised BMI, WC and GS at baseline with moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and acceleration after a median 5.7-years follow-up (interquartile range: 4.9-6.5 years). RESULTS: Linear regression revealed strong inverse associations for BMI and WC, and positive associations for GS with follow-up PA; in women, MVPA ranges from lowest to highest quintiles of GS were 42-48 min day(-1) in severely obese (BMI35 kg m(-)(2)), 52-57 min day(-1) in obese (30BMI<35 kg m(-)(2)), 61-65 min day(-1) in overweight (25BMI<30 kg m(-)(2)) and 69-75 min day(-1) in normal weight (18.5BMI<25 kg m(-2)). Follow-up MVPA was also lower in the lowest GS quintile (42-69 min day(-1)) compared with the highest GS quintile (48-75 min day(-1)) across BMI categories in women. The pattern of these associations was generally consistent for men, and in analyses using WC and mean acceleration as exposure and outcome, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: More pronounced obesity and poor strength at baseline independently predict lower activity levels at follow-up. Interventions and policies should aim to improve body composition and muscle strength to promote active living.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28529332","10.1038/ijo.2017.122"

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the association between a validated genetic profile risk score for obesity (GPRS-obesity) and body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference (WC) was modified by macronutrient intake in a large general population study. METHODS: This study included cross-sectional data from 48 170 white European adults, aged 37-73 years, participating in the UK Biobank. Interactions between GPRS-obesity and macronutrient intake (including total energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate and dietary fibre intake) and its effects on BMI and WC were investigated. RESULTS: The 93-single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) GPRS was associated with a higher BMI (beta: 0.57 kg m(-)(2) per s.d. increase in GPRS (95% confidence interval: 0.53-0.60); P=1.9 x 10(-183)) independent of major confounding factors. There was a significant interaction between GPRS and total fat intake (P(interaction)=0.007). Among high-fat-intake individuals, BMI was higher by 0.60 (0.52, 0.67) kg m(-2) per s.d. increase in GPRS-obesity; the change in BMI with GPRS was lower among low-fat-intake individuals (beta: 0.50 (0.44, 0.57) kg m(-2)). Significant interactions with similar patterns were observed for saturated fat intake (high beta: 0.66 (0.59, 0.73) versus low beta: 0.49 (0.42, 0.55) kg m(-2), P(interaction)=2 x 10(-4)) and for total energy intake (high beta: 0.58 (0.51, 0.64) versus low beta: 0.49 (0.42, 0.56) kg m(-2), P(interaction)=0.019), but not for protein intake, carbohydrate intake and fibre intake (P(interaction) >0.05). The findings were broadly similar using WC as the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the benefits of reducing the intake of fats and total energy intake may be more important in individuals with high genetic risk for obesity.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28736445","10.1038/ijo.2017.169"

We used linkage disequilibrium regression and polygenic profile scoring to test for shared genetic aetiology between cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric disorders and physical health. Using information provided by many published genome-wide association study consortia, we created polygenic profile scores for 24 vascular-metabolic, neuropsychiatric, physiological-anthropometric and cognitive traits in the participants of UK Biobank, a very large population-based sample (N=112 151). Pleiotropy between cognitive and health traits was quantified by deriving genetic correlations using summary genome-wide association study statistics and to the method of linkage disequilibrium score regression. Substantial and significant genetic correlations were observed between cognitive test scores in the UK Biobank sample and many of the mental and physical health-related traits and disorders assessed here. In addition, highly significant associations were observed between the cognitive test scores in the UK Biobank sample and many polygenic profile scores, including coronary artery disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, autism, major depressive disorder, body mass index, intracranial volume, infant head circumference and childhood cognitive ability. Where disease diagnosis was available for UK Biobank participants, we were able to show that these results were not confounded by those who had the relevant disease. These findings indicate that a substantial level of pleiotropy exists between cognitive abilities and many human mental and physical health disorders and traits and that it can be used to predict phenotypic variance across samples.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26809841","10.1038/mp.2015.225"

Previous genome-wide association (GWA) studies of cognitive functions have found evidence for polygenic effects yet, to date, there are few replicated genetic associations. Here we use data from the UK Biobank sample to investigate the genetic contributions to variation in tests of three cognitive functions and in educational attainment. GWA analyses were performed for verbal-numerical reasoning (N=36 035), memory (N=112 067), reaction time (N=111 483) and for the attainment of a college or a university degree (N=111 114). We report genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based associations in 20 genomic regions, and significant gene-based findings in 46 regions. These include findings in the ATXN2, CYP2DG, APBA1 and CADM2 genes. We report replication of these hits in published GWA studies of cognitive function, educational attainment and childhood intelligence. There is also replication, in UK Biobank, of SNP hits reported previously in GWA studies of educational attainment and cognitive function. GCTA-GREML analyses, using common SNPs (minor allele frequency>0.01), indicated significant SNP-based heritabilities of 31% (s.e.m.=1.8%) for verbal-numerical reasoning, 5% (s.e.m.=0.6%) for memory, 11% (s.e.m.=0.6%) for reaction time and 21% (s.e.m.=0.6%) for educational attainment. Polygenic score analyses indicate that up to 5% of the variance in cognitive test scores can be predicted in an independent cohort. The genomic regions identified include several novel loci, some of which have been associated with intracranial volume, neurodegeneration, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27046643","10.1038/mp.2016.45"

It is strongly associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and several other psychiatric conditions. Although neuroticism is heritable, attempts to identify the alleles involved in previous studies have been limited by relatively small sample sizes. Here we report a combined meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) of neuroticism that includes 91 370 participants from the UK Biobank cohort, 6659 participants from the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) and 8687 participants from a QIMR (Queensland Institute of Medical Research) Berghofer Medical Research Institute (QIMR) cohort. All participants were assessed using the same neuroticism instrument, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R-S) Short Form's Neuroticism scale. We found a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability estimate for neuroticism of approximately 15% (s.e.=0.7%). Meta-analysis identified nine novel loci associated with neuroticism. The strongest evidence for association was at a locus on chromosome 8 (P=1.5 x 10(-15)) spanning 4 Mb and containing at least 36 genes. Other associated loci included interesting candidate genes on chromosome 1 (GRIK3 (glutamate receptor ionotropic kainate 3)), chromosome 4 (KLHL2 (Kelch-like protein 2)), chromosome 17 (CRHR1 (corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1) and MAPT (microtubule-associated protein Tau)) and on chromosome 18 (CELF4 (CUGBP elav-like family member 4)). We found no evidence for genetic differences in the common allelic architecture of neuroticism by sex. By comparing our findings with those of the Psychiatric Genetics Consortia, we identified a strong genetic correlation between neuroticism and MDD and a less strong but significant genetic correlation with schizophrenia, although not with bipolar disorder. Polygenic risk scores derived from the primary UK Biobank sample captured approximately 1% of the variance in neuroticism in the GS:SFHS and QIMR samples, although most of the genome-wide significant alleles identified within a UK Biobank-only GWAS of neuroticism were not independently replicated within these cohorts. The identification of nine novel neuroticism-associated loci will drive forward future work on the neurobiology of neuroticism and related phenotypes.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27067015","10.1038/mp.2016.49"

Univariate GCTA-GREML found that the proportion of variance explained by all common single-nucleotide polymorphisms for this tiredness question was 8.4% (s.e.=0.6%). GWAS identified one genome-wide significant hit (Affymetrix id 1:64178756_C_T; P=1.36 x 10(-11)). Linkage disequilibrium score regression and polygenic profile score analyses were used to test for shared genetic aetiology between tiredness and up to 29 physical and mental health traits from GWAS consortia. Significant genetic correlations were identified between tiredness and body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, forced expiratory volume, grip strength, HbA1c, longevity, obesity, self-rated health, smoking status, triglycerides, type 2 diabetes, waist-hip ratio, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, neuroticism, schizophrenia and verbal-numerical reasoning (absolute rg effect sizes between 0.02 and 0.78).

Well-known genetic variants in alcohol metabolizing genes, for example, ALDH2 and ADH1B, are strongly associated with alcohol consumption but have limited impact in European populations where they are found at low frequency. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of self-reported alcohol consumption in 112 117 individuals in the UK Biobank (UKB) sample of white British individuals. We report significant genome-wide associations at 14 loci. These include single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in alcohol metabolizing genes (ADH1B/ADH1C/ADH5) and two loci in KLB, a gene recently associated with alcohol consumption. We also identify SNPs at novel loci including GCKR, CADM2 and FAM69C. Gene-based analyses found significant associations with genes implicated in the neurobiology of substance use (DRD2, PDE4B). GCTA analyses found a significant SNP-based heritability of self-reported alcohol consumption of 13% (se=0.01). Sex-specific analyses found largely overlapping GWAS loci and the genetic correlation (rG) between male and female alcohol consumption was 0.90 (s.e.=0.09, P-value=7.16 x 10(-23)).

We identify 74 genome-wide significant loci associated with the number of years of schooling completed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with educational attainment are disproportionately found in genomic regions regulating gene expression in the fetal brain. Candidate genes are preferentially expressed in neural tissue, especially during the prenatal period, and enriched for biological pathways involved in neural development. Our findings demonstrate that, even for a behavioural phenotype that is mostly environmentally determined, a well-powered GWAS identifies replicable associated genetic variants that suggest biologically relevant pathways. Because educational attainment is measured in large numbers of individuals, it will continue to be useful as a proxy phenotype in efforts to characterize the genetic influences of related phenotypes, including cognition and neuropsychiatric diseases.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27225129","10.1038/nature17671"

Estimates using simple family-based statistical models were inflated on average by approximately 47% when compared with those from structural equation modeling (SEM), which specifically accounted for shared familial environmental factors.

We introduce a new phasing algorithm, Eagle2, that attains high accuracy across a broad range of cohort sizes by efficiently leveraging information from large external reference panels (such as the Haplotype Reference Consortium; HRC) using a new data structure based on the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform.

While observational studies have demonstrated an association between age at menarche and adult body mass index (BMI), confounding makes it difficult to infer causality. METHODS: The Mendelian randomization (MR) technique is not limited by traditional confounding and was used to investigate the presence of a causal effect of age at menarche on adult BMI. MR uses genetic variants as instruments under the assumption that they act on BMI only through age at menarche (no pleiotropy). Using a two-sample MR approach, heterogeneity between the MR estimates from individual instruments was used as a proxy for pleiotropy, with sensitivity analyses performed if detected. Genetic instruments and estimates of their association with age at menarche were obtained from a genome-wide association meta-analysis on 182,416 women. The genetic effects on adult BMI were estimated using data on 80,465 women from the UK Biobank. The presence of a causal effect of age at menarche on adult BMI was further investigated using data on 70,692 women from the GIANT Consortium. RESULTS: There was evidence of pleiotropy among instruments. Using the UK Biobank data, after removing instruments associated with childhood BMI that were likely exerting pleiotropy, fixed-effect meta-analysis across instruments demonstrated that a 1 year increase in age at menarche reduces adult BMI by 0.38 kg/m(2) (95% CI 0.25-0.51 kg/m(2)). However, evidence of pleiotropy remained. MR-Egger regression did not suggest directional bias, and similar estimates to the fixed-effect meta-analysis were obtained in sensitivity analyses when using a random-effect model, multivariable MR, MR-Egger regression, a weighted median estimator and a weighted mode-based estimator. The direction and significance of the causal effect were replicated using GIANT Consortium data. CONCLUSION: MR provides evidence to support the hypothesis that earlier age at menarche causes higher adult BMI. Complex hormonal and psychological factors may be responsible.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29549348","10.1038/s41366-018-0048-7"

Habitual PA appears to be heritable, motivating the search for specific genetic variants that may inform efforts to promote PA and target the best type of PA for each individual. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We used data from the UK Biobank to perform the largest genome-wide association study of PA to date, using three measures based on self-report (nmax = 377,234) and two measures based on wrist-worn accelerometry data (nmax = 91,084). We examined genetic correlations of PA with other traits and diseases, as well as tissue-specific gene expression patterns. With data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC; n = 8,556) study, we performed a meta-analysis of our top hits for moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). RESULTS: We identified ten loci across all PA measures that were significant in both a basic and a fully adjusted model (p < 5 x 10(-9)). Upon meta-analysis of the nine top hits for MVPA with results from ARIC, eight were genome-wide significant. Interestingly, among these, the rs429358 variant in the APOE gene was the most strongly associated with MVPA, whereby the allele associated with higher Alzheimer's risk was associated with greater MVPA. However, we were not able to rule out possible selection bias underlying this result. Variants in CADM2, a gene previously implicated in obesity, risk-taking behavior and other traits, were found to be associated with habitual PA. We also identified three loci consistently associated (p < 5 x 10(-5)) with PA across both self-report and accelerometry, including CADM2. We found genetic correlations of PA with educational attainment, chronotype, psychiatric traits, and obesity-related traits. Tissue enrichment analyses implicate the brain and pituitary gland as locations where PA-associated loci may exert their actions. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide new insight into the genetic basis of habitual PA, and the genetic links connecting PA with other traits and diseases.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29899525","10.1038/s41366-018-0120-3"

More recently, exome- and whole-genome sequencing of cases and families have identified rare, high penetrant variants that provide direct functional insight. There remains, however, a gap in the heritability explained by these complementary approaches. To understand how multiple genetic variants combine to modify both severity and penetrance of a highly penetrant variant, we sequenced 48 whole genomes from a family with a high loading of psychiatric disorder linked to a balanced chromosomal translocation. The (1;11)(q42;q14.3) translocation directly disrupts three genes: DISC1, DISC2, DISC1FP and has been linked to multiple brain imaging and neurocognitive outcomes in the family. Using DNA sequence-level linkage analysis, functional annotation and population-based association, we identified common and rare variants in GRM5 (minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05), PDE4D (MAF > 0.2) and CNTN5 (MAF < 0.01) that may help explain the individual differences in phenotypic expression in the family.

Fourteen genetic loci have previously been associated with smoking behaviour-related traits. We tested up to 235,116 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on the exome-array for association with smoking initiation, cigarettes per day, pack-years, and smoking cessation in a fixed effects meta-analysis of up to 61 studies (up to 346,813 participants). In a subset of 112,811 participants, a further one million SNVs were also genotyped and tested for association with the four smoking behaviour traits. SNV-trait associations with P < 5 x 10(-8) in either analysis were taken forward for replication in up to 275,596 independent participants from UK Biobank. Lastly, a meta-analysis of the discovery and replication studies was performed. Sixteen SNVs were associated with at least one of the smoking behaviour traits (P < 5 x 10(-8)) in the discovery samples. Ten novel SNVs, including rs12616219 near TMEM182, were followed-up and five of them (rs462779 in REV3L, rs12780116 in CNNM2, rs1190736 in GPR101, rs11539157 in PJA1, and rs12616219 near TMEM182) replicated at a Bonferroni significance threshold (P < 4.5 x 10(-3)) with consistent direction of effect. A further 35 SNVs were associated with smoking behaviour traits in the discovery plus replication meta-analysis (up to 622,409 participants) including a rare SNV, rs150493199, in CCDC141 and two low-frequency SNVs in CEP350 and HDGFRP2. Functional follow-up implied that decreased expression of REV3L may lower the probability of smoking initiation. The novel loci will facilitate understanding the genetic aetiology of smoking behaviour and may lead to the identification of potential drug targets for smoking prevention and/or cessation.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30617275","10.1038/s41380-018-0313-0"

Family studies have estimated substantial heritability of suicidal behavior; however, collecting the sample sizes necessary for successful genetic studies has remained a challenge. We utilized two different approaches in independent datasets to characterize the contribution of common genetic variation to suicide attempt. The first is a patient reported suicide attempt phenotype asked as part of an online mental health survey taken by a subset of participants (n = 157,366) in the UK Biobank. After quality control, we leveraged a genotyped set of unrelated, white British ancestry participants including 2433 cases and 334,766 controls that included those that did not participate in the survey or were not explicitly asked about attempting suicide. The second leveraged electronic health record (EHR) data from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC, 2.8 million patients, 3250 cases) and machine learning to derive probabilities of attempting suicide in 24,546 genotyped patients. We identified significant and comparable heritability estimates of suicide attempt from both the patient reported phenotype in the UK Biobank (h(2)SNP = 0.035, p = 7.12 x 10(-4)) and the clinically predicted phenotype from VUMC (h(2)SNP = 0.046, p = 1.51 x 10(-2)). A significant genetic overlap was demonstrated between the two measures of suicide attempt in these independent samples through polygenic risk score analysis (t = 4.02, p = 5.75 x 10(-5)) and genetic correlation (rg = 1.073, SE = 0.36, p = 0.003). Finally, we show significant but incomplete genetic correlation of suicide attempt with insomnia (rg = 0.34-0.81) as well as several psychiatric disorders (rg = 0.26-0.79). This work demonstrates the contribution of common genetic variation to suicide attempt. It points to a genetic underpinning to clinically predicted risk of attempting suicide that is similar to the genetic profile from a patient reported outcome. Lastly, it presents an approach for using EHR data and clinical prediction to generate quantitative measures from binary phenotypes that can improve power for genetic studies.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30610202","10.1038/s41380-018-0326-8"

In keeping with the Research Domain Criteria approach, it may be a useful construct for identifying biology that cuts across psychiatric categories. We aimed to investigate the biological validity of a simple measure of mood instability and evaluate its genetic relationship with several psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of mood instability in 53,525 cases and 60,443 controls from UK Biobank, identifying four independently associated loci (on chromosomes 8, 9, 14 and 18), and a common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability estimate of ~8%. We found a strong genetic correlation between mood instability and MDD (r g = 0.60, SE = 0.07, p = 8.95 x 10(-17)) and a small but significant genetic correlation with both schizophrenia (r g = 0.11, SE = 0.04, p = 0.01) and anxiety disorders (r g = 0.28, SE = 0.14, p = 0.04), although no genetic correlation with BD, ADHD or PTSD was observed. Several genes at the associated loci may have a role in mood instability, including the DCC netrin 1 receptor (DCC) gene, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit beta (eIF2B2), placental growth factor (PGF) and protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type D (PTPRD). Strengths of this study include the very large sample size, but our measure of mood instability may be limited by the use of a single question. Overall, this work suggests a polygenic basis for mood instability. This simple measure can be obtained in very large samples; our findings suggest that doing so may offer the opportunity to illuminate the fundamental biology of mood regulation.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29187730","10.1038/s41398-017-0012-7"

We sought to ascertain whether it is more informative to maximize the sample size using data from all available cases and controls, or to use a sex or recurrent stratified subset of affected individuals. To test this, we compared heritability estimates, genetic correlation with other traits, variance explained by MDD polygenic score, and variants identified by genome-wide meta-analysis for broad and narrow MDD classifications in two large British cohorts - Generation Scotland and UK Biobank. Genome-wide meta-analysis of MDD in males yielded one genome-wide significant locus on 3p22.3, with three genes in this region (CRTAP, GLB1, and TMPPE) demonstrating a significant association in gene-based tests. Meta-analyzed MDD, recurrent MDD and female MDD yielded equivalent heritability estimates, showed no detectable difference in association with polygenic scores, and were each genetically correlated with six health-correlated traits (neuroticism, depressive symptoms, subjective well-being, MDD, a cross-disorder phenotype and Bipolar Disorder). Whilst stratified GWAS analysis revealed a genome-wide significant locus for male MDD, the lack of independent replication, and the consistent pattern of results in other MDD classifications suggests that phenotypic stratification using recurrence or sex in currently available sample sizes is currently weakly justified. Based upon existing studies and our findings, the strategy of maximizing sample sizes is likely to provide the greater gain.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29317602","10.1038/s41398-017-0034-1"

In secondary analyses, we assessed sex-specific effects, trans-ethnic heterogeneity and genetic overlap with psychiatric traits. We also investigated the impact of risk-taking-associated SNPs on both gene expression and structural brain imaging. We identified 10 independent loci for risk-taking behaviour, of which eight were novel and two replicated previous findings. In addition, we found two further sex-specific risk-taking loci. There were strong positive genetic correlations between risk-taking and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Index genetic variants demonstrated effects generally consistent with the discovery analysis in individuals of non-British White, South Asian, African-Caribbean or mixed ethnicity. Polygenic risk scores comprising alleles associated with increased risk taking were associated with lower white matter integrity. Genotype-specific expression pattern analyses highlighted DPYSL5, CGREF1 and C15orf59 as plausible candidate genes. Overall, our findings substantially advance our understanding of the biology of risk-taking behaviour, including the possibility of sex-specific contributions, and reveal consistency across ethnicities.

METHODS: We used the UK Biobank resource to develop genetic predictors of height and applied these in a Mendelian randomisation framework to estimate the causal relationship between height and cancer. Up to 438,870 UK Biobank participants were considered in our analysis. We addressed two primary cancer outcomes, cancer incidence by age ~60 and cancer mortality by age ~60 (where age ~60 is the typical age of UK Biobank participants). RESULTS: We found that each genetically predicted 9 cm increase in height conferred an odds ratio of 1.10 (95% confidence interval 1.07-1.13) and 1.09 (1.02-1.16) for diagnosis of any cancer and death from any cancer, respectively. For both risk and mortality, the effect was larger in females than in males. CONCLUSIONS: Height increases the risk of being diagnosed with and dying from cancer. These findings from Mendelian randomisation analyses agree with observational studies and provide evidence that they were not likely to have been strongly affected by confounding or reporting bias.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29581483","10.1038/s41416-018-0063-4"

RESULTS: We detected 30 women with 45,X; 186 with mosaic 45,X/46,XX; and 110 with 47,XXX. The prevalence of nonmosaic 45,X (12/100,000) and 47,XXX (45/100,000) was lower than expected, but was higher for mosaic 45,X/46,XX (76/100,000).

Traditional estimates based on family or twin studies can be biased due to shared environmental or non-additive genetic variance. Alternatively, those based on genotyped or imputed variants typically underestimate narrow-sense heritability contributed by rare or otherwise poorly tagged causal variants. Identical-by-descent (IBD) segments of the genome share all variants between pairs of chromosomes except new mutations that have arisen since the last common ancestor. Therefore, relating phenotypic similarity to degree of IBD sharing among classically unrelated individuals is an appealing approach to estimating the near full additive genetic variance while possibly avoiding biases that can occur when modeling close relatives. We applied an IBD-based approach (GREML-IBD) to estimate heritability in unrelated individuals using phenotypic simulation with thousands of whole-genome sequences across a range of stratification, polygenicity levels, and the minor allele frequencies of causal variants (CVs). In simulations, the IBD-based approach produced unbiased heritability estimates, even when CVs were extremely rare, although precision was low. However, population stratification and non-genetic familial environmental effects shared across generations led to strong biases in IBD-based heritability. We used data on two traits in ~120,000 people from the UK Biobank to demonstrate that, depending on the trait and possible confounding environmental effects, GREML-IBD can be applied to very large genetic datasets to infer the contribution of very rare variants lost using other methods. However, we observed apparent biases in these real data, suggesting that more work may be required to understand and mitigate factors that influence IBD-based heritability estimates.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29588506","10.1038/s41437-018-0067-0"

The discovered CNVs are recurrent and rare (0.01-0.2%), with large effects on height (>2.4 cm), weight (>5 kg), and body mass index (BMI) (>3.5 kg/m(2)). Burden analysis shows a 0.41 cm decrease in height, a 0.003 increase in waist-to-hip ratio and increase in BMI by 0.14 kg/m(2) for each Mb of total deletion burden (P = 2.5 x 10(-10), 6.0 x 10(-5), and 2.9 x 10(-3)). Our study provides evidence that the same genes (e.g., MC4R, FIBIN, and FMO5) harbor both common and rare variants affecting body size and that anthropometric traits share genetic loci with developmental and psychiatric disorders.Individual SNPs have small effects on anthropometric traits, yet the impact of CNVs has remained largely unknown.

We applied our approach to blood pressure phenotypes in the UK Biobank data (N = 360,243), the results of which we report here.

The causes and genetic consequences of assortative mating remain un-re-solved because partner similarity can arise from different mechanisms: phenotypic assortment based on mate choice(15,16), partner interaction and convergence in phenotype over time(14,17), or social homogamy where individuals pair according to social or environmental background.

We show that KLF14 diabetes-risk alleles act in adipose tissue to reduce KLF14 expression and modulate, in trans, the expression of 385 genes. We demonstrate, in human cellular studies, that reduced KLF14 expression increases pre-adipocyte proliferation but disrupts lipogenesis, and in mice, that adipose tissue-specific deletion of Klf14 partially recapitulates the human phenotype of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and T2D. We show that carriers of the KLF14 T2D risk allele shift body fat from gynoid stores to abdominal stores and display a marked increase in adipocyte cell size, and that these effects on fat distribution, and the T2D association, are female specific. The metabolic risk associated with variation at this imprinted locus depends on the sex both of the subject and of the parent from whom the risk allele derives.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29632379","10.1038/s41588-018-0088-x"

We present the most thorough and realistic comparison of these methods to date. We used thousands of real whole-genome sequences to simulate phenotypes under varying genetic architectures and confounding variables, and we used array, imputed, or whole genome sequence SNPs to obtain 'SNP-heritability' estimates. We show that SNP-heritability can be highly sensitive to assumptions about the frequencies, effect sizes, and levels of linkage disequilibrium of underlying causal variants, but that methods that bin SNPs according to minor allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium are less sensitive to these assumptions across a wide range of genetic architectures and possible confounding factors.

Recent genome-wide meta-analyses have identified 24 genomic loci linked to variation in intelligence(3-7), but much about its genetic underpinnings remains to be discovered. Here, we present a large-scale genetic association study of intelligence (n = 269,867), identifying 205 associated genomic loci (190 new) and 1,016 genes (939 new) via positional mapping, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, chromatin interaction mapping, and gene-based association analysis. We find enrichment of genetic effects in conserved and coding regions and associations with 146 nonsynonymous exonic variants. Associated genes are strongly expressed in the brain, specifically in striatal medium spiny neurons and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Gene set analyses implicate pathways related to nervous system development and synaptic structure. We confirm previous strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization analysis results suggest protective effects of intelligence for Alzheimer's disease and ADHD and bidirectional causation with pleiotropic effects for schizophrenia. These results are a major step forward in understanding the neurobiology of cognitive function as well as genetically related neurological and psychiatric disorders.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29942086","10.1038/s41588-018-0152-6"

This method, SAIGE (Scalable and Accurate Implementation of GEneralized mixed model), provides accurate P values even when case-control ratios are extremely unbalanced.

Psychiatric diseases and traits related to mental health and ability appear to be most polygenic, involving a continuum of small effects. Most other traits, including major chronic diseases, involve clusters of SNPs that have distinct magnitudes of effects. We predict that the sample sizes needed to identify SNPs that explain most heritability found in genome-wide association studies will range from a few hundred thousand to multiple millions, depending on the underlying effect-size distributions of the traits.

We identified 42 loci associated with diverticular disease; 39 of these loci are novel. Using data-driven expression-prioritized integration for complex traits (DEPICT), we show that genes in these associated regions are significantly enriched for expression in mesenchymal stem cells and multiple connective tissue cell types and are co-expressed with genes that have a role in vascular and mesenchymal biology. Genes in these associated loci have roles in immunity, extracellular matrix biology, cell adhesion, membrane transport and intestinal motility.

A calibration set with sample size of ~200 individuals was sufficient for optimal performance. GraBLD yielded prediction R (2) of 0.239 and 0.082 using GIANT summary association statistics for height and BMI in the UK Biobank study (N = 130 K; 1.98 M SNPs), explaining 46.9% and 32.7% of the overall polygenic variance, respectively.

Domain specific analyses using available cognitive measures in the UK Biobank also did not support effects by habitual coffee intake for reaction time, pairs matching, reasoning or prospective memory (P >/= 0.05 for all). Despite the power to detect very small effects, our meta-analysis provided no evidence for causal long-term effects of habitual coffee consumption on global cognition or memory.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29760501","10.1038/s41598-018-25919-2"

Fetal growth was estimated by two-dimensional ultrasound scans at 20, 25 and 32 weeks of gestation and growth trajectories were modeled using mixed linear regression. A genetic risk score (GRS) of birth weight-raising variants was associated with intrauterine growth showing an attenuating effect on the unconditional daily reduction in proportional weight gain of 8.92 x 10(-6) percentage points/allele/day (p = 2.0 x 10(-4)), corresponding to a mean difference of 410 g at 40 weeks of gestation between a child with lowest and highest GRS. Eight variants were independently associated with intrauterine growth throughout the pregnancy, while four variants were associated with fetal growth in the periods 20-25 or 25-32 weeks of gestation, indicating that some variants may act in specific time windows during pregnancy. Four of the intrauterine growth variants were associated with type 2 diabetes, hypertension or BMI in the UK Biobank, which may provide basis for further understanding of the link between intrauterine growth and later risk of metabolic disease.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29849051","10.1038/s41598-018-26752-3"

To shed light on the relation between the two, large-scale available molecular genetic data were leveraged to gain more insight into the genetic architecture of the overlap between hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. Hence, we conducted the first genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of eudaimonic well-being (N = ~108 K) and linked it to a GWAS of hedonic well-being (N = ~222 K). We identified the first two genome-wide significant independent loci for eudaimonic well-being and six independent loci for hedonic well-being. Joint analyses revealed a moderate phenotypic correlation (r = 0.53) and a high genetic correlation (rg = 0.78) between eudaimonic and hedonic well-being. This indicates that the genetic etiology of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being is substantially shared, with divergent (environmental) factors contributing to their phenotypic divergence. Loci regulating expression showed significant enrichment in the brain cortex, brain cerebellum, frontal cortex, as well as the cerebellar hemisphere for eudaimonic well-being. No significant enrichment for hedonic well-being is observed, although brain tissues were top ranked. Genetic correlations patterns with a range of positive and negative related phenotypes were largely similar for hedonic -and eudaimonic well-being.

Higher caffeine perception was also associated with increased risk of being a heavy (>4 cups/day) coffee drinker (OR 1.207 [1.126, 1.294]).

Polygenic risk for several health-related measures were associated with neuroticism, in a positive direction in the case of bipolar disorder, borderline personality, major depressive disorder, negative affect, neuroticism (Genetics of Personality Consortium), schizophrenia, coronary artery disease, and smoking (beta between 0.009-0.043), and in a negative direction in the case of body mass index (beta=-0.0095). A high level of pleiotropy exists between neuroticism and some measures of mental and physical health, particularly major depressive disorder and schizophrenia.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27115122","10.1038/tp.2016.56"

It is characterized by low mood, psychomotor slowing and increased levels of the personality trait neuroticism; factors also associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). It is possible that some cases of MDD may have a substantial genetic loading for SCZ. The presence of SCZ-like MDD subgroups would be indicated by an interaction between MDD status and polygenic risk of SCZ on cognitive, personality and mood measures. Here, we hypothesized that higher SCZ polygenic risk would define larger MDD case-control differences in cognitive ability, and smaller differences in distress and neuroticism. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for SCZ and their association with cognitive variables, neuroticism, mood and psychological distress were estimated in a large population-based cohort (Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study, GS:SFHS). The individuals were divided into those with, and without, depression (n=2587 and n=16 764, respectively) to test for the interactions between MDD status and schizophrenia risk. Replication was sought in UK Biobank (UKB; n=6049 and n=27 476 cases and controls, respectively). In both the cohorts, we found significant interactions between SCZ-PRS and MDD status for measures of psychological distress (betaGS=-0.04, PGS=0.014 and betaUKB=-0.09, PUKB0.001 for GS:SFHS and UKB, respectively) and neuroticism (betaGS=-0.04, PGS=0.002 and betaUKB=-0.06, PUKB=0.023). In both the cohorts, there was a reduction of case-control differences on a background of higher genetic risk of SCZ. These findings suggest that depression on a background of high genetic risk for SCZ may show attenuated associations with distress and neuroticism. This may represent a causally distinct form of MDD more closely related to SCZ.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27801894","10.1038/tp.2016.207"

We used genotype data to test whether MDD and AD have an overlapping polygenic architecture in two large population-based cohorts, Generation Scotland's Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS; N=19 889) and UK Biobank (N=25 118), and whether age of depression onset influences any relationship.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) generated using summary data from International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium were used to assess potential pleiotropy between the disorders. PRS for MDD were nominally associated with participant-recalled AD family history in GS:SFHS, although this association did not survive multiple comparison testing. AD PRS were not associated with depression status or late-onset depression, and a survival analysis showed no association between age of depression onset and genetic risk for AD.

We explored this using linkage disequilibrium score regression, polygenic risk scoring (PRS) techniques, Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis and BUHMBOX. Utilising summary statistics from ENIGMA and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we demonstrated that hippocampal volume was positively genetically correlated with MDD (rG=0.46, P=0.02), although this did not survive multiple comparison testing.

Using PRS analysis, no regional volumetric PRS demonstrated a significant association with MDD or recurrent MDD. MR analysis in hippocampal volume and MDD identified no causal association, however, BUHMBOX analysis identified genetic subgrouping in GS:SFHS MDD cases only (P=0.00281). In this study, we provide some evidence that hippocampal volume and MDD may share genetic architecture in a subgroup of individuals, albeit the genetic correlation did not survive multiple testing correction and genetic subgroup heterogeneity was not replicated.

To identify DNA variants associated with IBS risk, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the large UK Biobank population-based cohort, which includes genotype and health data from 500,000 participants. METHODS: We studied 7,287,191 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms in individuals who self-reported a doctor's diagnosis of IBS (cases; n = 9576) compared to the remainder of the cohort (controls; n = 336,499) (mean age of study subjects, 40-69 years). Genome-wide significant findings were further investigated in 2045 patients with IBS from tertiary centers and 7955 population controls from Europe and the United States, and a small general population sample from Sweden (n = 249). Functional annotation of GWAS results was carried out by integrating data from multiple biorepositories to obtain biological insights from the observed associations. RESULTS: We identified a genome-wide significant association on chromosome 9q31.2 (single nucleotide polymorphism rs10512344; P = 3.57 x 10(-8)) in a region previously linked to age at menarche, and 13 additional loci of suggestive significance (P < 5.0x10(-6)). Sex-stratified analyses revealed that the variants at 9q31.2 affect risk of IBS in women only (P = 4.29 x 10(-10) in UK Biobank) and also associate with constipation-predominant IBS in women (P = .015 in the tertiary cohort) and harder stools in women (P = .0012 in the population-based sample). Functional annotation of the 9q31.2 locus identified 8 candidate genes, including the elongator complex protein 1 gene (ELP1 or IKBKAP), which is mutated in patients with familial dysautonomia. CONCLUSIONS: In a sufficiently powered GWAS of IBS, we associated variants at the locus 9q31.2 with risk of IBS in women. This observation may provide additional rationale for investigating the role of sex hormones and autonomic dysfunction in IBS.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29626450","10.1053/j.gastro.2018.03.064"

One proposed solution that recently gained popularity is the idea to use genes as instrumental variables [i.e., Mendelian randomization (MR)]. However, this approach is problematic because many variables of interest are genetically correlated, which implies the possibility that many genes could affect both the exposure and the outcome directly or via unobserved confounding factors. Thus, pleiotropic effects of genes are themselves a source of bias in nonexperimental data that would also undermine the ability of MR to correct for endogeneity bias from nongenetic sources. Here, we propose an alternative approach, genetic instrumental variable (GIV) regression, that provides estimates for the effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of pleiotropy. As a valuable byproduct, GIV regression also provides accurate estimates of the chip heritability of the outcome variable. GIV regression uses polygenic scores (PGSs) for the outcome of interest which can be constructed from genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. By splitting the GWAS sample for the outcome into nonoverlapping subsamples, we obtain multiple indicators of the outcome PGSs that can be used as instruments for each other and, in combination with other methods such as sibling fixed effects, can address endogeneity bias from both pleiotropy and the environment. In two empirical applications, we demonstrate that our approach produces reasonable estimates of the chip heritability of educational attainment (EA) and show that standard regression and MR provide upwardly biased estimates of the effect of body height on EA.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29686100","10.1073/pnas.1707388115"

This process requires the endosomal-sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery and is tightly regulated by charged multivesicular body protein 4C (CHMP4C), an ESCRT-III subunit that engages the abscission checkpoint (NoCut) in response to mitotic problems such as persisting chromatin bridges within the midbody. Importantly, a human polymorphism in CHMP4C (rs35094336, CHMP4C(T232)) increases cancer susceptibility. Here, we explain the structural and functional basis for this cancer association: The CHMP4C(T232) allele unwinds the C-terminal helix of CHMP4C, impairs binding to the early-acting ESCRT factor ALIX, and disrupts the abscission checkpoint. Cells expressing CHMP4C(T232) exhibit increased levels of DNA damage and are sensitized to several conditions that increase chromosome missegregation, including DNA replication stress, inhibition of the mitotic checkpoint, and loss of p53. Our data demonstrate the biological importance of the abscission checkpoint and suggest that dysregulation of abscission by CHMP4C(T232) may synergize with oncogene-induced mitotic stress to promote genomic instability and tumorigenesis.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30181294","10.1073/pnas.1805504115"

However, population-level evidence of ethno-racial difference in morning-evening type is limited. In an earlier study, we reported that morning type was more prevalent in Blacks compared to Whites in the United Kingdom (UK) Biobank cohort (N = 439 933). This study aimed to determine if these ethno-racial differences persisted after accounting for an even broader range of social, environmental and individual characteristics and employing an analytic approach that simulates randomization in observational data, propensity score modeling. Data from UK Biobank participants whose self-identified race/ethnicity was Black/Black British or White; who did not report daytime napping, shift work or night shift work; who provided full mental health information; and who were identified using propensity score matching were used (N = 2044). Each sample was strongly matched across all social, environmental and individual characteristics as indicated by absolute standardized mean differences <0.09 for all variables. The prevalence of reporting nocturnal short, adequate and long sleep as well as morning, intermediate and evening type among Blacks (n = 1022) was compared with a matched sample of Whites (n = 1022) using multinomial logistic regression models. Blacks had a 62% greater odds of being morning type [odds ratio (OR) = 1.620, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.336-1.964, p < .0001] and a more than threefold greater odds of reporting nocturnal short sleep (OR = 3.453, 95% CI: 2.846-4.190, p < .0001) than Whites. These data indicate that the greater prevalence of morning type and short nocturnal sleep in Blacks compared to Whites is not fully explained by a wide range of social and environmental factors. If sleep is an upstream determinant of health, these data suggest that ethno-racially targeted public health sleep intervention strategies are needed.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28488939","10.1080/07420528.2017.1317639"

However, no one has examined whether chronotype is associated with mortality risk to date. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that being an evening type is associated with increased mortality in a large cohort study, the UK Biobank. Our analysis included 433 268 adults aged 38-73 at the time of enrolment and an average 6.5-year follow-up. The primary exposure was chronotype, as assessed through a single self-reported question-defining participants as definite morning types, moderate morning types, moderate evening types or definite evening types. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and mortality due to CVD. Prevalent disease was also compared among the chronotype groups. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, body mass index, sleep duration, socioeconomic status and comorbidities. Greater eveningness, particularly being a definite evening type, was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of all comorbidities. Comparing definite evening type to definite morning type, the associations were strongest for psychological disorders (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.86-2.02, p = < 0.001), followed by diabetes (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.24-1.36, p = < 0.001), neurological disorders (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.20-1.30, p = < 0.001), gastrointestinal/abdominal disorders (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.19-1.27, p = < 0.001) and respiratory disorders (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.18-1.26, p = < 0.001). The total number of deaths was 10 534, out of which 2127 were due to CVD. Greater eveningness, based on chronotype as an ordinal variable, was associated with a small increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.004-1.05, p = 0.017) and CVD mortality (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.09, p = 0.06). Compared to definite morning types, definite evening types had significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18, p = 0.012). This first report of increased mortality in evening types is consistent with previous reports of increased levels of cardiometabolic risk factors in this group. Mortality risk in evening types may be due to behavioural, psychological and physiological risk factors, many of which may be attributable to chronic misalignment between internal physiological timing and externally imposed timing of work and social activities. These findings suggest the need for researching possible interventions aimed at either modifying circadian rhythms in individuals or at allowing evening types greater working hour flexibility.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29642757","10.1080/07420528.2018.1454458"

The objective of this study was to investigate whether shiftwork was independently associated with obesity, diabetes, poor sleep, and well-being in a large, UK general population cohort. METHODS: Participants of the UK Biobank study who were employed at the time of assessment were included. Exposure variables were self-reported shiftwork (any shiftwork and night shiftwork); and outcomes were objectively measured obesity, inflammation and physical activity and self-reported lifestyle, sleep and well-being variables, including mental health. RESULTS: Shiftwork was reported by 17% of the 277,168 employed participants. Shiftworkers were more likely to be male, socioeconomically deprived and smokers, and to have higher levels of physical activity. Univariately, and following adjustment for lifestyle and work-related confounders, shiftworkers were more likely to be obese, depressed, to report disturbed sleep, and to have neurotic traits. CONCLUSIONS: Shiftwork was independently associated with multiple indicators of poor health and wellbeing, despite higher physical activity, and even in shiftworkers that did not work nights.

METHODS: Phenotypic data on cardiometabolic and lifestyle factors were collected throughout a 4 year time period from 502,642 middle-aged participants in UK Biobank. To assess the impact of seasonal environmental changes on cardiovascular risk factors, we linked these data to the outdoor temperature and day length at the time of assessment. Self-reported information on physical activity, diet and disease status were used to adjust for confounding factors related to health and lifestyle. RESULTS: Mortality related to CVD was higher in winter, as were risk factors for this condition including blood pressure, markers of inflammation and body mass index (BMI). These seasonal rhythms were significantly related to day length after adjustment for other factors that might affect seasonality including physical activity, diet and outdoor temperature. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of CVD may be modulated by day length at temperate latitudes, and the implications of seasonality should be considered in all studies of human cardiometabolic health. Key messages In this cross-sectional study in UK Biobank, we report annual variations in cardiovascular risk factors and mortality that were associated with day length independent of environmental and lifestyle factors.

We tested for interactions with age and with the presence versus absence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypertension. RESULTS: in several instances, APOE e4 dosage interacted with older age and disease presence to affect cognitive scores.

Objective: We aimed to perform cross-sectional analyses of diet group with anthropometric and physiologic characteristics in a large cohort in the United Kingdom. Design: The UK Biobank recruited approximately 500,000 middle-aged participants throughout the United Kingdom in 2006-2010. Anthropometric indexes (height, weight, waist and hip circumference, body composition) and other physiologic characteristics (heel bone mineral density, grip strength, blood pressure, pulse rate) were measured following standardized protocols. We estimated the age-adjusted means of each characteristic in 6 diet groups (198,166 regular meat eaters, 199,784 low meat eaters, 4381 poultry eaters, 9674 fish eaters, 6366 vegetarians, and 378 vegans) in white women and men, and in 2 diet groups (3322 meat eaters and 1186 vegetarians) in British Indian women and men. Results: In white women, after adjustment for age and compared with regular meat eaters, non-red meat eaters had lower adiposity (e.g., 4.5% lower body fat in vegan women) and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure (-4.2 and -3.3 mm Hg, respectively), and generally lower heel bone mineral density t-score (-0.26). Patterns of differences by diet group were similar in white men. In the Indian population, compared with meat eaters, vegetarian women were shorter (-1.1 cm) and had lower lean mass (-0.5 kg), and both vegetarian women and men had lower grip strength (-1.3 and -1.4 kg, respectively). No significant differences in the other characteristics were observed. Conclusions: Differences in anthropometric and physiologic characteristics were observed across diet groups in white participants, but fewer differences were observed in British Indian participants.

There is currently a wealth of GWAS data collected in numerous phenotypes, and analyzing multiple traits at once can increase power to detect shared variant effects. However, traditional meta-analysis methods are not suitable for combining studies on different traits. When applied to dissimilar studies, these meta-analysis methods can be underpowered compared to univariate analysis. The degree to which traits share variant effects is often not known, and the vast majority of GWAS meta-analysis only consider one trait at a time. Results: Here, we present a flexible method for finding associated variants from GWAS summary statistics for multiple traits. Our method estimates the degree of shared effects between traits from the data. Using simulations, we show that our method properly controls the false positive rate and increases power when an effect is present in a subset of traits. We then apply our method to the North Finland Birth Cohort and UK Biobank datasets using a variety of metabolic traits and discover novel loci.

There was a significant interaction between total physical activity and grip strength (P < 0.0001) whereby the higher hazard of mortality associated with lower physical activity was greatest among participants in the lowest tertile for grip strength (hazard ratio, HR:1.11 [95% CI 1.09-1.14]) and lowest among those in the highest grip strength tertile (HR:1.04 [1.01-1.08]).

The association between physical activity and mortality was larger among those in the lowest tertile of CRF (HR:1.13 [1.02-1.26]) than those in the highest (HR:1.03 [0.91-1.16]). The pattern for CVD events was similar. Conclusions: These data provide novel evidence that strength, and possibly CRF, moderate the association between physical activity and mortality. The association between physical activity and mortality is strongest in those with the lowest strength (which is easily measured), and the lowest CRF, suggesting that these sub-groups could benefit most from interventions to increase physical activity.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28158566","10.1093/eurheartj/ehw249"

We aimed to quantify the magnitude of their associations with non-demented cognitive abilities and determine the extent to which these associations were additive. Methods and results: We examined cognitive test scores in domains of reasoning, information processing speed and memory, included as part of the baseline UK Biobank cohort assessment (N = 474 129 with relevant data), adjusting for a range of potentially confounding variables. The presence of hypertension, CAD and diabetes generally associated with poorer cognitive scores on all tests, compared with a control group that reported none of these diseases. There was evidence of an additive deleterious dose effect of an increasing number of cardiometabolic diseases, for reasoning scores (unstandardized additive dose beta per disease = -0.052 score points out of 13, 95% CI [confidence intervals] -0.063 to - 0.041, P < 0.001), log reaction time scores (exponentiated beta = 1.005, i.e. 0.5% slower, 95% CI 1.004-1.005, P < 0.001) and log memory errors (exponentiated beta = 1.005 i.e. 0.5% more errors; 95% CI 1.003-1.008). Conclusion: Cardiometabolic diseases are associated with worse cognitive abilities, and the potential effect of an increasing number of cardiometabolic conditions appears additive.

Methods and results: A total of 230 670 women and 190 057 men free from prevalent cancer and cardiovascular disease were included from UK Biobank. Usual walking pace was self-defined as slow, steady/average or brisk. Handgrip strength was assessed by dynamometer. Cox-proportional hazard models were adjusted for social deprivation, ethnicity, employment, medications, alcohol use, diet, physical activity, and television viewing time. Interaction terms investigated whether age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status modified associations. Over 6.3 years, there were 8598 deaths, 1654 from cardiovascular disease and 4850 from cancer. Associations of walking pace with mortality were modified by BMI. In women, the hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality in slow compared with fast walkers were 2.16 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.68-2.77] and 1.31 (1.08-1.60) in the bottom and top BMI tertiles, respectively; corresponding HRs for men were 2.01 (1.68-2.41) and 1.41 (1.20-1.66). Hazard ratios for cardiovascular mortality remained above 1.7 across all categories of BMI in men and women, with modest heterogeneity in men. Handgrip strength was associated with cardiovascular mortality in men only (HR tertile 1 vs. tertile 3 = 1.38; 1.18-1.62), without differences across BMI categories, while associations with all-cause mortality were only seen in men with low BMI. Associations for walking pace and handgrip strength with cancer mortality were less consistent. Conclusion: A simple self-reported measure of slow walking pace could aid risk stratification for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality within the general population.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29020281","10.1093/eurheartj/ehx449"

The aim of our study was to examine the associations of body composition (assessed by five different measures) with incident CVD outcomes in healthy individuals. Methods and results: A total of 296 535 participants (57.8% women) of white European descent without CVD at baseline from the UK biobank were included. Exposures were five different measures of adiposity. Fatal and non-fatal CVD events were the primary outcome. Low BMI (</=18.5 kg m-2) was associated with higher incidence of CVD and the lowest CVD risk was exhibited at BMI of 22-23 kg m-2 beyond, which the risk of CVD increased. This J-shaped association attenuated substantially in subgroup analyses, when we excluded participants with comorbidities. In contrast, the associations for the remaining adiposity measures were more linear; 1 SD increase in waist circumference was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.16 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.19] for women and 1.10 (95% CI 1.08-1.13) for men with similar magnitude of associations for 1 SD increase in waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, and percentage body fat mass. Conclusion: Increasing adiposity has a detrimental association with CVD health in middle-aged men and women. The association of BMI with CVD appears more susceptible to confounding due to pre-existing comorbidities when compared with other adiposity measures. Any public misconception of a potential 'protective' effect of fat on CVD risk should be challenged. Take home figureThe obesity paradox is mainly due to the effect of confounding on BMI and disappears on other adiposity measures.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29718151","10.1093/eurheartj/ehy057"

Methods and results: Community cohort participants (UK Biobank n = 502 637) aged 37-73 years were recruited between 2006 and 2010. Self-reported LTCs (n = 42) identified in people with AF at baseline. All-cause mortality was available for a median follow-up of 7 years (interquartile range 76-93 months). Hazard ratios (HRs) examined associations between number and type of co-morbid LTC and all-cause mortality, adjusting for age, sex, socio-economic status, smoking, and anticoagulation status. Three thousand six hundred fifty-one participants (0.7% of the study population) reported AF; mean age was 61.9 years. The all-cause mortality rate was 6.7% (248 participants) at 7 years. Atrial fibrillation participants with >/=4 co-morbidities had a six-fold higher risk of mortality compared to participants without any LTC. Co-morbid heart failure was associated with higher risk of mortality [HR 2.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83-4.80], whereas the presence of co-morbid stroke did not have a significant association. Among non-cardiometabolic conditions, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 3.31, 95% CI 2.14-5.11) and osteoporosis (HR 3.13, 95% CI 1.63-6.01) was associated with a higher risk of mortality. Conclusion: Survival in middle-aged to older individuals with self-reported AF is strongly correlated with level of multimorbidity. This group should be targeted for interventions to optimize their management, which in turn may potentially reduce the impact of their co-morbidities on survival. Future AF clinical guidelines need to place greater emphasis on the issue of co-morbidity.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29112751","10.1093/europace/eux322"

We tested whether individuals with low cardiovascular disease risk, aged 60-69 years old at baseline in two large cohorts, were less likely to develop aging-related adverse health outcomes. METHODS: Data were from population representative medical records (Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD] England, n = 239,591) and healthy volunteers (UK Biobank [UKB], n = 181,820), followed for </=10 years. A cardiovascular disease risk score (CRS) summarized smoking status, LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass index, fasting glucose and physical activity, grouping individuals as low (ie, all factors near ideal), moderate, or high CRS. Logistic regression, Cox models, and Fine and Grey risk models tested the associations between the CRS and health outcomes. RESULTS: Low CRS individuals had less chronic pain (UKB: baseline odds ratio = 0.52, confidence interval [CI] = 0.50-0.54), lower incidence of incontinence (CPRD: subhazard ratio [sub-HR] = 0.75, 0.63-0.91), falls (sub-HR = 0.82, CI = 0.73-0.91), fragility fractures (sub-HR = 0.78, CI = 0.65-0.93), and dementia (vs. high risks; UKB: sub-HR = 0.67, CI = 0.50-0.89; CPRD: sub-HR = 0.79, CI = 0.56-1.12). Only 5.4% in CPRD with low CRS became frail (Rockwood index) versus 24.2% with high CRS. All-cause mortality was markedly lower in the low CRS group (vs. high CRS; HR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.35-0.47). All associations showed dose-response relationships, and results were similar in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Persons aged 60-69 years with near-ideal cardiovascular risk factor profiles have substantially lower incidence of geriatric conditions and frailty. Optimizing cardiovascular disease risk factors may substantially reduce the burden of morbidity in later life.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29982474","10.1093/gerona/gly083"

Researching FIs in resources with large-scale genetic and phenotypic data will provide insights into the causes and consequences of frailty. Thus, we aimed to develop an FI using UK Biobank data, a cohort study of 500,000 middle-aged and older adults. METHODS: An FI was calculated using 49 self-reported questionnaire items on traits covering health, presence of diseases and disabilities, and mental well-being, according to standard protocol. We used multiple imputation to derive FI values for the entire eligible sample in the presence of missing item data (N = 500,336). To validate the measure, we assessed associations of the FI with age, sex, and risk of all-cause mortality (follow-up </= 9.7 years) using linear and Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Mean FI in the cohort was 0.125 (SD = 0.075), and there was a curvilinear trend toward higher values in older participants. FI values were also marginally higher on average in women than in men. In survival models, 10% higher baseline frailty (ie, a 0.1 FI increment) was associated with higher risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.65; 95% confidence interval: 1.62-1.68). Associations were stronger in younger participants than in older participants, and in men than in women (hazard ratios: 1.72 vs. 1.56, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The FI is a valid measure of frailty in UK Biobank. The cohort's data are open access for researchers to use, and we provide script for deriving this tool to facilitate future studies on frailty.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29924297","10.1093/gerona/gly094"

Restricted access to much individual-level phenotype data makes it difficult to estimate large-scale phenotypic correlation across the human phenome. Two state-of-the-art methods, metaCCA and LD score regression, provide an alternative approach to estimate phenotypic correlation using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary results. Results: Here, we present an integrated R toolkit, PhenoSpD, to use LD score regression to estimate phenotypic correlations using GWAS summary statistics and to utilize the estimated phenotypic correlations to inform correction of multiple testing for complex human traits using the spectral decomposition of matrices (SpD). The simulations suggest that it is possible to identify nonindependence of phenotypes using samples with partial overlap; as overlap decreases, the estimated phenotypic correlations will attenuate toward zero and multiple testing correction will be more stringent than in perfectly overlapping samples. Also, in contrast to LD score regression, metaCCA will provide approximate genetic correlations rather than phenotypic correlation, which limits its application for multiple testing correction. In a case study, PhenoSpD using UK Biobank GWAS results suggested 399.6 independent tests among 487 human traits, which is close to the 352.4 independent tests estimated using true phenotypic correlation. We further applied PhenoSpD to an estimated 5,618 pair-wise phenotypic correlations among 107 metabolites using GWAS summary statistics from Kettunen's publication and PhenoSpD suggested the equivalent of 33.5 independent tests for these metabolites. Conclusions: PhenoSpD extends the use of summary-level results, providing a simple and conservative way to reduce dimensionality for complex human traits using GWAS summary statistics. This is particularly valuable in the age of large-scale biobank and consortia studies, where GWAS results are much more accessible than individual-level data.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30165448","10.1093/gigascience/giy090"

One possible bias is 'index event bias' (IEB) that appears due to the stratification by, or enrichment for, disease status when testing associations between genetic variants and a disease-associated trait. We aimed to test the extent to which IEB influences some known trait associations in a range of study designs and provide a statistical framework for assessing future associations. Analyzing data from 113 203 non-diabetic UK Biobank participants, we observed three (near TCF7L2, CDKN2AB and CDKAL1) overestimated (body mass index (BMI) decreasing) and one (near MTNR1B) underestimated (BMI increasing) associations among 11 type 2 diabetes risk alleles (at P < 0.05). IEB became even stronger when we tested a type 2 diabetes genetic risk score composed of these 11 variants (-0.010 standard deviations BMI per allele, P = 5 x 10- 4), which was confirmed in four additional independent studies. Similar results emerged when examining the effect of blood pressure increasing alleles on BMI in normotensive UK Biobank samples. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, under realistic scenarios, common disease alleles would become associated at P < 5 x 10- 8 with disease-related traits through IEB alone, if disease prevalence in the sample differs appreciably from the background population prevalence. For example, some hypertension and type 2 diabetes alleles will be associated with BMI in sample sizes of >500 000 if the prevalence of those diseases differs by >10% from the background population. In conclusion, IEB may result in false positive or negative genetic associations in very large studies stratified or strongly enriched for/against disease cases.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28040731","10.1093/hmg/ddw433"

We undertook logistic regression using data from the UK Biobank and the ECLIPSE COPD cohort. Results were meta-analyzed with summary data from a further three COPD cohorts (7,519 total cases and 35,653 total controls), showing no association between Asp358Ala and COPD (OR = 1.02 [95% CI: 0.96, 1.07]). Data from the UK Biobank showed a positive association between the Asp358Ala variant and atopic asthma (OR = 1.07 [1.01, 1.13]). In a series of in vitro studies using blood samples from 37 participants, we found that shedding of sIL-6R from neutrophils was greater in carriers of the Asp358Ala minor allele than in non-carriers. Human pulmonary artery endothelial cells cultured with serum from homozygous carriers showed an increase in MCP-1 release in carriers of the minor allele, with the difference eliminated upon addition of tocilizumab. In conclusion, there is evidence that neutrophils may be an important source of sIL-6R in the lungs, and the Asp358Ala variant may have pro-inflammatory effects in lung cells.

We meta-analysed heart rate association results from 104 452 European-ancestry individuals from 30 cohorts, genotyped using the Exome Chip. Twenty-four variants were selected for follow-up in an independent dataset (UK Biobank, N = 134 251). Conditional and gene-based testing was undertaken, and variants were investigated with bioinformatics methods.We discovered five novel heart rate loci, and one new independent low-frequency non-synonymous variant in an established heart rate locus (KIAA1755). Lead variants in four of the novel loci are non-synonymous variants in the genes C10orf71, DALDR3, TESK2 and SEC31B. The variant at SEC31B is significantly associated with SEC31B expression in heart and tibial nerve tissue. Further candidate genes were detected from long-range regulatory chromatin interactions in heart tissue (SCD, SLF2 and MAPK8). We observed significant enrichment in DNase I hypersensitive sites in fetal heart and lung. Moreover, enrichment was seen for the first time in human neuronal progenitor cells (derived from embryonic stem cells) and fetal muscle samples by including our novel variants.Our findings advance the knowledge of the genetic architecture of heart rate, and indicate new candidate genes for follow-up functional studies.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28379579","10.1093/hmg/ddx113"

Here we confirmed, by a genome-wide association study within UK Biobank, the existence of two independent BP-related signals within NPR3 locus. Using human primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) from different individuals, we found that the BP-elevating alleles within one linkage disequilibrium block identified by the sentinel variant rs1173771 was associated with lower endogenous NPR3 mRNA and protein levels in VSMCs, together with reduced levels in open chromatin and nuclear protein binding. The BP-elevating alleles also increased VSMC proliferation, angiotensin II-induced calcium flux and cell contraction. However, an analogous genotype-dependent association was not observed in vascular ECs. Our study identifies novel, putative mechanisms for BP-associated variants at the NPR3 locus to elevate BP, further strengthening the case for targeting NPR-C as a therapeutic approach for hypertension and cardiovascular disease prevention.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29040610","10.1093/hmg/ddx375"

We aimed to identify maternal genetic variants associated with birth weight that could highlight potentially relevant maternal determinants of fetal growth. We meta-analysed data on up to 8.7 million SNPs in up to 86 577 women of European descent from the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) Consortium and the UK Biobank. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) and analyses of mother-child pairs to quantify the separate maternal and fetal genetic effects. Maternal SNPs at 10 loci (MTNR1B, HMGA2, SH2B3, KCNAB1, L3MBTL3, GCK, EBF1, TCF7L2, ACTL9, CYP3A7) were associated with offspring birth weight at P < 5 x 10-8. In SEM analyses, at least 7 of the 10 associations were consistent with effects of the maternal genotype acting via the intrauterine environment, rather than via effects of shared alleles with the fetus. Variants, or correlated proxies, at many of the loci had been previously associated with adult traits, including fasting glucose (MTNR1B, GCK and TCF7L2) and sex hormone levels (CYP3A7), and one (EBF1) with gestational duration. The identified associations indicate that genetic effects on maternal glucose, cytochrome P450 activity and gestational duration, and potentially on maternal blood pressure and immune function, are relevant for fetal growth. Further characterization of these associations in mechanistic and causal analyses will enhance understanding of the potentially modifiable maternal determinants of fetal growth, with the goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with low and high birth weights.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29309628","10.1093/hmg/ddx429"

Joint likelihood mapping provided evidence that the genetic variant which influenced DNA methylation levels for 348 of these associations across 47 traits was also responsible for variation in complex traits.

Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in approximately 450000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N approximately 700000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits. We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of P < 1 x 10-8), including 1185 height-associated SNPs and 751 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The near-independent genome-wide significant SNPs explain approximately 24.6% of the variance of height and approximately 6.0% of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were approximately 0.44 and approximately 0.22, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization, we identified an enrichment of eQTLs among lead height and BMI signals, prioritizing 610 and 138 genes, respectively.

Stratification by sex or cancer types did not reveal any meaningful differences albeit wider confidence intervals. Fixed-effect meta-analysis of our individual cancer risk estimates with those derived from publicly available cancer consortia data and previous studies further reinforced our null Mendelian randomization findings on prostate, lung, colorectal and breast cancers with tight confidence intervals; for ovarian and pancreatic cancers, our estimates were less precise despite being not statistically significant.

SUMMARY ANSWER: The T allele of the FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638; c.-211G>T) results in longer menstrual cycles and later menopause and, while having detrimental effects on fertility, is protective against endometriosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638; c.-211G>T) affects levels of FSHB transcription and, as a result, circulating levels of FSH. FSH is required for normal fertility and genetic variants at the FSHB locus are associated with age at menopause and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We used cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank to look at associations between the FSHB promoter polymorphism and reproductive traits, and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for length of menstrual cycle. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We included white British individuals aged 40-69 years in 2006-2010, in the May 2015 release of genetic data from UK Biobank. We tested the FSH-lowering T allele of the FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638; c.-211G>T) for associations with 29, mainly female, reproductive phenotypes in up to 63 350 women and 56 608 men. We conducted a GWAS in 9534 individuals to identify genetic variants associated with length of menstrual cycle. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The FSH-lowering T allele of the FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638; MAF 0.16) was associated with longer menstrual cycles [0.16 SD (c. 1 day) per minor allele; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.20; P = 6 x 10(-16)], later age at menopause (0.13 years per minor allele; 95% CI 0.04-0.22; P = 5.7 x 10(-3)), greater female nulliparity [odds ratio (OR) = 1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.11; P = 4.8 x 10(-3)] and lower risk of endometriosis (OR = 0.79; 95% CI 0.69-0.90; P = 4.1 x 10(-4)). The FSH-lowering T allele was not associated with other female reproductive illnesses or conditions in our study and we did not replicate associations with male infertility or PCOS. In the GWAS for menstrual cycle length, only variants near the FSHB gene reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-9)). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The data included might be affected by recall bias. Cycle length was not available for 25% of women still cycling (1% did not answer, 6% did not know and for 18% cycle length was recorded as 'irregular'). Women with a cycle length recorded were aged over 40 and were approaching menopause; however, we did not find evidence that this affected the results. Many of the groups with illnesses had relatively small sample sizes and so the study may have been under-powered to detect an effect. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: We found a strong novel association between a genetic variant that lowers FSH levels and longer menstrual cycles, at a locus previously robustly associated with age at menopause. The variant was also associated with nulliparity and endometriosis risk. These findings should now be verified in a second independent group of patients. We conclude that lifetime differences in circulating levels of FSH between individuals can influence menstrual cycle length and a range of reproductive outcomes, including menopause timing, infertility, endometriosis and PCOS.

We aimed to use the UK Biobank data to study the well-established, but poorly understood, association between low birthweight and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We used logistic regression to calculate the odds ratio for participants' risk of type 2 diabetes given a one standard deviation increase in birthweight. To test for an association between parental diabetes and birthweight, we performed linear regression of self-reported parental diabetes status against birthweight. We performed path and mediation analyses to test the hypothesis that birthweight partly mediates the association between parental diabetes and participant type 2 diabetes status. RESULTS: Of the UK Biobank participants, 277 261 reported their birthweight. Of 257 715 individuals of White ethnicity and singleton pregnancies, 6576 had type 2 diabetes, 19 478 reported maternal diabetes (but not paternal), 20 057 reported paternal diabetes (but not maternal) and 2754 participants reported both parents as having diabetes. Lower birthweight was associated with type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank participants. A one kilogram increase in birthweight was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.76; P = 2 x 10(-57)). Paternal diabetes was associated with lower birthweight (45 g lower; 95% CI: 36, 54; P = 2 x 10(-23)) relative to individuals with no parental diabetes. Maternal diabetes was associated with higher birthweight (59 g increase; 95% CI: 50, 68; P = 3 x 10(-37)). Participants' lower birthweight was a mediator of the association between reported paternal diabetes and participants' type 2 diabetes status, explaining 1.1% of the association, and participants' higher birthweight was a mediator of the association between reported maternal diabetes and participants' type 2 diabetes status, explaining 1.2% of the association. CONCLUSIONS: Data from the UK Biobank provides the strongest evidence by far that paternal diabetes is associated with lower birthweight, whereas maternal diabetes is associated with increased birthweight. Our findings with paternal diabetes are consistent with a role for the same genetic factors influencing foetal growth and type 2 diabetes.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24336895","10.1093/ije/dyt220"

A dataset from UK Biobank was used to evaluate the impact of pre-analytical variability on the power of association studies. METHODS: First, we estimated the proportion of the variance in analyte concentration that may be attributed to delay in processing using variance component analysis. Then, we captured the proportion of heterogeneity between subjects that is due to variability in the rate of degradation of analytes, by fitting a mixed model. Finally, we evaluated the impact of delay in processing on the power of a nested case-control study using a power calculator that we developed and which takes into account uncertainty in outcome and explanatory variables measurements. RESULTS: The results showed that (i) the majority of the analytes investigated in our analysis, were stable over a period of 36 h and (ii) some analytes were unstable and the resulting pre-analytical variation substantially decreased the power of the study, under the settings we investigated. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to specify a limited delay in processing for analytes that are very sensitive to delayed assay. If the rate of degradation of an analyte varies between individuals, any delay introduces a bias which increases with increasing delay. If pre-analytical variation occurring due to delays in sample processing is ignored, it affects adversely the power of the studies that use the data.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25085103","10.1093/ije/dyu127"

Longitudinally, baseline MVPA was not associated with grip strength at follow-up {difference between quintile [Q] 5 and Q1 = 0.40 [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.14, 0.94]kg}, whereas baseline grip strength was associated with MVPA at follow-up [Q5 vs Q1 = 7.15 (1.18, 13.12) min/day]. People who maintained/increased time spent in MVPA did not experience any benefit in grip strength [0.08 (-0.20, 0.37) kg] whereas those who increased their grip strength spent 3.69 (0.20, 7.17) min/day extra in MVPA. Conclusion: Promotion of strength-training activities may enable and maintain participation in regular physical activity among older adults.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27209633","10.1093/ije/dyw054"

We examined the extent to which sugar, relative to other macronutrients, was associated with adiposity. Methods: We used baseline data from UK Biobank to examine the associations between energy intake (total and individual macronutrients) and adiposity [body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat and waist circumference]. Linear regression models were conducted univariately and adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity and physical activity. Results: Among 132 479 participants, 66.3% of men and 51.8% of women were overweight/obese. There was a weak correlation (r = 0.24) between energy from sugar and fat; 13% of those in the highest quintile for sugar were in the lowest for fat, and vice versa. Compared with normal BMI, obese participants had 11.5% higher total energy intake and 14.6%, 13.8%, 9.5% and 4.7% higher intake from fat, protein, starch and sugar, respectively. Hence, the proportion of energy derived from fat was higher (34.3% vs 33.4%, P < 0.001) but from sugar was lower (22.0% vs 23.4%, P < 0.001). BMI was more strongly associated with total energy [coefficient 2.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.36-2.55] and energy from fat (coefficient 1.96, 95% CI 1.91-2.06) than sugar (coefficient 0.48, 95% CI 0.41-0.55). The latter became negative after adjustment for total energy. Conclusions: Fat is the largest contributor to overall energy. The proportion of energy from fat in the diet, but not sugar, is higher among overweight/obese individuals. Focusing public health messages on sugar may mislead on the need to reduce fat and overall energy consumption.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27407038","10.1093/ije/dyw173"

Twin studies indicate SRH has a heritability of up to 60% and that its genetic architecture may overlap with that of personality and cognition. Methods: We carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of SRH on 111 749 members of the UK Biobank sample. Univariate genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA)-GREML analyses were used to estimate the proportion of variance explained by all common autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for SRH. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression and polygenic risk scoring, two complementary methods, were used to investigate pleiotropy between SRH in the UK Biobank and up to 21 health-related and personality and cognitive traits from published GWAS consortia. Results: The GWAS identified 13 independent signals associated with SRH, including several in regions previously associated with diseases or disease-related traits. The strongest signal was on chromosome 2 (rs2360675, P = 1.77 x 10 -10 ) close to KLF7 . A second strong peak was identified on chromosome 6 in the major histocompatibility region (rs76380179, P = 6.15 x 10 -10 ). The proportion of variance in SRH that was explained by all common genetic variants was 13%. Polygenic scores for the following traits and disorders were associated with SRH: cognitive ability, education, neuroticism, body mass index (BMI), longevity, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, lung function, blood pressure, coronary artery disease, large vessel disease stroke and type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: Individual differences in how people respond to a single item on SRH are partly explained by their genetic propensity to many common psychiatric and physical disorders and psychological traits.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27864402","10.1093/ije/dyw219"

However, these studies have proven controversial as to which, if any, measures of the environment accentuate genetic susceptibility to high body mass index (BMI). Methods: We used up to 120 000 adults from the UK Biobank study to test the hypothesis that high-risk obesogenic environments and behaviours accentuate genetic susceptibility to obesity. We used BMI as the outcome and a 69-variant genetic risk score (GRS) for obesity and 12 measures of the obesogenic environment as exposures. These measures included Townsend deprivation index (TDI) as a measure of socio-economic position, TV watching, a 'Westernized' diet and physical activity. We performed several negative control tests, including randomly selecting groups of different average BMIs, using a simulated environment and including sun-protection use as an environment. Results: We found gene-environment interactions with TDI (Pinteraction = 3 x 10 -10 ), self-reported TV watching (Pinteraction = 7 x 10 -5 ) and self-reported physical activity (Pinteraction = 5 x 10 -6 ). Within the group of 50% living in the most relatively deprived situations, carrying 10 additional BMI-raising alleles was associated with approximately 3.8 kg extra weight in someone 1.73 m tall. In contrast, within the group of 50% living in the least deprivation, carrying 10 additional BMI-raising alleles was associated with approximately 2.9 kg extra weight. The interactions were weaker, but present, with the negative controls, including sun-protection use, indicating that residual confounding is likely. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the obesogenic environment accentuates the risk of obesity in genetically susceptible adults. Of the factors we tested, relative social deprivation best captures the aspects of the obesogenic environment responsible.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28073954","10.1093/ije/dyw337"

However, without a proper biological understanding of the pleiotropic working of genetic variants, a fundamental assumption of Mendelian randomization (the exclusion restriction) can always be contested. Methods: We build upon and synthesize recent advances in the literature on instrumental variables (IVs) estimation that test and relax the exclusion restriction. Our pleiotropy-robust Mendelian randomization (PRMR) method first estimates the degree of pleiotropy, and in turn corrects for it. If (i) a subsample exists for which the genetic variants do not affect the exposure; (ii) the selection into this subsample is not a joint consequence of the IV and the outcome; (iii) pleiotropic effects are homogeneous, PRMR obtains unbiased estimates of causal effects. Results: Simulations show that existing MR methods produce biased estimators for realistic forms of pleiotropy. Under the aforementioned assumptions, PRMR produces unbiased estimators. We illustrate the practical use of PRMR by estimating the causal effect of: (i) tobacco exposure on body mass index (BMI); (ii) prostate cancer on self-reported health; and (iii) educational attainment on BMI in the UK Biobank data. Conclusions: PRMR allows for instrumental variables that violate the exclusion restriction due to pleiotropy, and it corrects for pleiotropy in the estimation of the causal effect. If the degree of pleiotropy is unknown, PRMR can still be used as a sensitivity analysis.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28338774","10.1093/ije/dyx002"

This study examined whether a more precise measure of PA relelvant to bone was associated with meaures of bone health in pre- and post-menopausal women in UK Biobank. Methods: Time spent at intensities specific to bone health [>/=750 milli-gravitational units (mg) and >/=1000 mg] were analysed from raw tri-axial acceleration data averaged over 1-second epochs from 7-day monitoring of habitual PA using accelerometry-based activity monitors (100 Hz; AX3, Axivity, UK) of 1218 pre- and 1316 post-menopausal healthy women. In a cross-sectional analysis, associations between categories of time (<1, 1-2 and >/=2 minutes) spent above the intensity thresholds and calcaneal quantitative ultrasound measures of bone health (bone mineral density T-score, BMDT-score; speed of sound, SOS; and broadband ultrasound attenuation, BUA) were examined. Results: Compared with <1 minute, spending 1-2 or >/=2 minutes/day at intensities >/=1000 mg in pre-menopausal and >/=750 mg in post-menopausal women was positively associated with BMDT-score, SOS and BUA. Conclusion: Brief bursts of high-intensity PA relevant to bone health can be captured by applying bone-specific thresholds of intensity to raw tri-axial accelerations averaged over 1-second epochs. Accumulating 1-2 minutes/day of high-intensity PA, equivalent to running in pre-menopausal women and slow jogging in post-menopausal women, is associated with better bone health.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29106579","10.1093/ije/dyx080"

Methods: We performed Mendelian randomization analyses in the UK Biobank (N = 114 029), the Norwegian HUNT study (N = 56 664) and the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) (N = 78 650). We used the rs16969968 genetic variant as a proxy for smoking heaviness in all studies and rs4410790 and rs2472297 as proxies for coffee consumption in UK Biobank and CGPS. Analyses were conducted using linear regression and meta-analysed across studies. Results: Each additional cigarette per day consumed by current smokers was associated with higher coffee consumption (0.10 cups per day, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.17). There was weak evidence for an increase in tea consumption per additional cigarette smoked per day (0.04 cups per day, 95% CI: -0.002, 0.07). There was strong evidence that each additional copy of the minor allele of rs16969968 (which increases daily cigarette consumption) in current smokers was associated with higher coffee consumption (0.16 cups per day, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.20), but only weak evidence for an association with tea consumption (0.04 cups per day, 95% CI: -0.01, 0.09). There was no clear evidence that rs16969968 was associated with coffee or tea consumption in never or former smokers or that the coffee-related variants were associated with cigarette consumption. Conclusions: Higher cigarette consumption causally increases coffee intake. This is consistent with faster metabolism of caffeine by smokers, but could also reflect a behavioural effect of smoking on coffee drinking.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29025033","10.1093/ije/dyx147"

It is unclear whether these associations represent the effect of an individual's own genotype on their birthweight, their mother's genotype, or both. Methods: We demonstrate how structural equation modelling (SEM) can be used to estimate both maternal and fetal effects when phenotype information is present for individuals in two generations and genotype information is available on the older individual. We conduct an extensive simulation study to assess the bias, power and type 1 error rates of the SEM and also apply the SEM to birthweight data in the UK Biobank study. Results: Unlike simple regression models, our approach is unbiased when there is both a maternal and a fetal effect. The method can be used when either the individual's own phenotype or the phenotype of their offspring is not available, and allows the inclusion of summary statistics from additional cohorts where raw data cannot be shared. We show that the type 1 error rate of the method is appropriate, and that there is substantial statistical power to detect a genetic variant that has a moderate effect on the phenotype and reasonable power to detect whether it is a fetal and/or a maternal effect. We also identify a subset of birthweight-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have opposing maternal and fetal effects in the UK Biobank. Conclusions: Our results show that SEM can be used to estimate parameters that would be difficult to quantify using simple statistical methods alone.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29447406","10.1093/ije/dyy015"

Methods: Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and UK Biobank, we used observational methods to test the hypothesis that smoking heaviness increases alcohol consumption. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were then used to test the causal relationship between smoking heaviness and alcohol consumption using 55 967 smokers from four European studies [ALSPAC, The Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT), the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) and UK Biobank]. MR analyses used rs1051730/rs16969968 as a genetic proxy for smoking heaviness. Results: Observational results provided evidence of an association between cigarettes per day and weekly alcohol consumption (increase in units of alcohol per additional cigarette smoked per day = 0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.15, P </= 0.001 in ALSPAC; and 0.48, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.52, P </= 0.001 in UK Biobank). However, there was little evidence for an association between rs1051730/rs16969968 and units of alcohol consumed per week across ALSPAC, HUNT, CGPS and UK Biobank (standard deviation increase in units of alcohol per additional copy of the risk allele = -0.004, 95% CI -0.023 to 0.016, P=0.708, I2 = 51.9%). We had 99% and 88% power to detect a change of 0.03 and 0.02 standard deviation units of alcohol per additional copy of the risk allele, respectively. Conclusions: Previously reported associations between smoking and alcohol are unlikely to be causal, and may be the result of confounding and/or reverse causation.

However, genetic instruments remain controversial, as horizontal pleiotropic effects can introduce bias into causal estimates. Recent work has highlighted the potential of gene-environment interactions in detecting and correcting for pleiotropic bias in MR analyses. METHODS: We introduce MR using Gene-by-Environment interactions (MRGxE) as a framework capable of identifying and correcting for pleiotropic bias. If an instrument-covariate interaction induces variation in the association between a genetic instrument and exposure, it is possible to identify and correct for pleiotropic effects. The interpretation of MRGxE is similar to conventional summary MR approaches, with a particular advantage of MRGxE being the ability to assess the validity of an individual instrument. RESULTS: We investigate the effect of adiposity, measured using body mass index (BMI), upon systolic blood pressure (SBP) using data from the UK Biobank and a single weighted allelic score informed by data from the GIANT consortium. We find MRGxE produces findings in agreement with two-sample summary MR approaches. Further, we perform simulations highlighting the utility of the approach even when the MRGxE assumptions are violated. CONCLUSIONS: By utilizing instrument-covariate interactions in MR analyses implemented within a linear-regression framework, it is possible to identify and correct for horizontal pleiotropic bias, provided the average magnitude of pleiotropy is constant across interaction-covariate subgroups.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30462199","10.1093/ije/dyy204"

Our objective was to examine the independent and combined association of maternal and own smoking with adult lung function and COPD. Methods: We used UK Biobank to examine associations of maternal smoking around delivery, and pack-years of own smoking, with lung function (n = 502 626) and hospitalization/death from COPD (n = 433 863). We calculated the additive interaction between maternal and own smoking on the outcomes of interest, and estimated the association with maternal smoking within categories of own smoking. Results: There was no strong evidence that maternal smoking influenced adult lung health among never smokers. Exposure to both maternal and own smoking was associated with lower Forced expiratory volume (FEV1)/ forced vital capacity (FVC) and greater risk of hospitalization/death from COPD than expected from their independent associations. For FEV1/FVC, the mean difference according to maternal smoking was -0.02 (-0.06, 0.02), -0.01 (-0.05, 0.03), -0.11 (-0.16, -0.05) and -0.11 (-0.19, -0.04) among women who smoked </=10, 11-20, 21-30 and >30 pack-years, respectively.

Previous studies have used genetic variants associated with BMI to provide evidence that higher body mass index (BMI) causes depression, but have not tested whether this relationship is driven by the metabolic consequences of BMI nor for differences between men and women. METHODS: We performed a Mendelian randomization study using 48 791 individuals with depression and 291 995 controls in the UK Biobank, to test for causal effects of higher BMI on depression (defined using self-report and Hospital Episode data). We used two genetic instruments, both representing higher BMI, but one with and one without its adverse metabolic consequences, in an attempt to 'uncouple' the psychological component of obesity from the metabolic consequences. We further tested causal relationships in men and women separately, and using subsets of BMI variants from known physiological pathways. RESULTS: Higher BMI was strongly associated with higher odds of depression, especially in women. Mendelian randomization provided evidence that higher BMI partly causes depression. Using a 73-variant BMI genetic risk score, a genetically determined one standard deviation (1 SD) higher BMI (4.9 kg/m2) was associated with higher odds of depression in all individuals [odds ratio (OR): 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09, 1.28, P = 0.00007) and women only (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.39, P = 0.0001). Meta-analysis with 45 591 depression cases and 97 647 controls from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) strengthened the statistical confidence of the findings in all individuals. Similar effect size estimates were obtained using different Mendelian randomization methods, although not all reached P < 0.05. Using a metabolically favourable adiposity genetic risk score, and meta-analysing data from the UK biobank and PGC, a genetically determined 1 SD higher BMI (4.9 kg/m2) was associated with higher odds of depression in all individuals (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.50], P = 0.010), but with weaker statistical confidence.

This has been extended to multivariable MR (MVMR) to estimate the effect of two or more exposures on an outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: We use simulations and theory to clarify the interpretation of estimated effects in a MVMR analysis under a range of underlying scenarios, where a secondary exposure acts variously as a confounder, a mediator, a pleiotropic pathway and a collider. We then describe how instrument strength and validity can be assessed for an MVMR analysis in the single-sample setting, and develop tests to assess these assumptions in the popular two-sample summary data setting. We illustrate our methods using data from UK Biobank to estimate the effect of education and cognitive ability on body mass index. CONCLUSION: MVMR analysis consistently estimates the direct causal effect of an exposure, or exposures, of interest and provides a powerful tool for determining causal effects in a wide range of scenarios with either individual- or summary-level data.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535378","10.1093/ije/dyy262"

A 2007 World Health Organization review concluded, mainly from animal evidence, that shift work involving circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic to humans. We therefore aimed to generate prospective epidemiological evidence on night shift work and breast cancer incidence. METHODS: Overall, 522 246 Million Women Study, 22 559 EPIC-Oxford, and 251 045 UK Biobank participants answered questions on shift work and were followed for incident cancer. Cox regression yielded multivariable-adjusted breast cancer incidence rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for night shift work vs no night shift work, and likelihood ratio tests for interaction were used to assess heterogeneity. Our meta-analyses combined these and relative risks from the seven previously published prospective studies (1.4 million women in total), using inverse-variance weighted averages of the study-specific log RRs. RESULTS: In the Million Women Study, EPIC-Oxford, and UK Biobank, respectively, 673, 28, and 67 women who reported night shift work developed breast cancer, and the RRs for any vs no night shift work were 1.00 (95% CI = 0.92 to 1.08), 1.07 (95% CI = 0.71 to 1.62), and 0.78 (95% CI = 0.61 to 1.00). In the Million Women Study, the RR for 20 or more years of night shift work was 1.00 (95% CI = 0.81 to 1.23), with no statistically significant heterogeneity by sleep patterns or breast cancer risk factors. Our meta-analysis of all 10 prospective studies included 4660 breast cancers in women reporting night shift work; compared with other women, the combined relative risks were 0.99 (95% CI = 0.95 to 1.03) for any night shift work, 1.01 (95% CI = 0.93 to 1.10) for 20 or more years of night shift work, and 1.00 (95% CI = 0.87 to 1.14) for 30 or more years. CONCLUSIONS: The totality of the prospective evidence shows that night shift work, including long-term shift work, has little or no effect on breast cancer incidence.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27758828","10.1093/jnci/djw169"

However, it is largely unknown whether these associations are due to shared (genetic) risk factors and/or causal effects (which may be bidirectional). METHODS: We obtained summary-level data of genome-wide association studies of smoking (smoking initiation [n = 74 035], cigarettes per day [n = 38 181], and smoking cessation [n = 41 278]) and sleep behaviors (sleep duration and chronotype, or ""morningness"" [n = 128 266] and insomnia [n = 113 006]). Using linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression, we calculated genetic correlations between smoking and sleep behaviors. To investigate causal effects, we employed Mendelian randomization (MR), both with summary-level data and individual-level data (n = 333 581 UK Biobank participants). For MR with summary-level data, individual genetic variants were combined with inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis, weighted median regression, MR-Robust Adjusted Profile Score, and MR Egger methods. RESULTS: We found negative genetic correlations between smoking initiation and sleep duration (rg = -.14, 95% CI = -0.26 to -0.01) and smoking cessation and chronotype (rg = -.18, 95% CI = -0.31 to -0.06), and positive genetic correlations between smoking initiation and insomnia (rg = .27, 95% CI = 0.06 to 0.49) and cigarettes per day and insomnia (rg = .15, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.28). MR provided strong evidence that smoking more cigarettes causally decreases the odds of being a morning person, (RAPS) and weak evidence that insomnia causally increases smoking heaviness and decreases smoking cessation odds. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking and sleep behaviors show moderate genetic correlation. Heavier smoking seems to causally affect circadian rhythm and there is some indication that insomnia increases smoking heaviness and hampers cessation. Our findings point to sleep as a potentially interesting smoking treatment target. IMPLICATIONS: Using LD score regression, we found evidence that smoking and different sleep behaviors (sleep duration, chronotype (morningness), and insomnia) are moderately genetically correlated-genetic variants associated with less or poorer sleep also increased the odds of smoking (more heavily). MR analyses suggested that heavier smoking causally affects circadian rhythm (decreasing the odds of being a morning person) and there was some indication that insomnia increases smoking heaviness and hampers smoking cessation. Our findings indicate a complex, bidirectional relationship between smoking and sleep behaviors and point to sleep as a potentially interesting smoking treatment target.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30365022","10.1093/ntr/nty230"

Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the UK Biobank: a cohort study of 502 655 participants, of whom 498 208 provided self-reported data on smoking and sleep characteristics. Multivariable multinomial and logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between smoking and sleep disturbance. Results: Long-sleep duration (>9 h) was more common among current smokers [odds ratio (OR): 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-1.85; probability value (P) = 0.001] than never smokers, especially heavy (>20/day) smokers (OR: 2.85; 95% CI: 1.66-4.89; P < 0.001).

Methods: Data from 13 342 men and women, aged between 40 and 73 years were used in regression analysis that tested the functional relationship and impact of alcohol on cognitive performance. Performance was measured using mean reaction time (RT) and intra-individual variation (IIV) in RT, collected in response to a perceptual matching task. Covariates included body mass index, physical activity, tobacco use, socioeconomic status, education and baseline cognitive function. Results: A restricted cubic spline regression with three knots showed how the linear (beta1 = -0.048, 95% CI: -0.105 to -0.030) and non-linear effects (beta2 = 0.035, 95% CI: 0.007-0.059) of alcohol use on mean RT and IIV in RT (beta1 = -0.055, 95% CI: -0.125 to -0.034; beta2 = 0.034, 95% CI: 0.002-0.064) were significant adjusting for covariates. Cognitive function declined as alcohol use increased beyond 10 g/day. Decline was more apparent as age increased. Conclusions: The relationship between alcohol use and cognitive function is non-linear. Consuming more than one UK standard unit of alcohol per day is detrimental to cognitive performance and is more pronounced in older populations.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29325150","10.1093/pubmed/fdx186"

The associations were explored using chi-square tests for trend and binary logistic regression. Results: Of the 386 493 participants who drove, 153 717 (39.8%) drove <1 h/day; 140 140 (36.3%) 1 h/day; 60 973 (15.8%) 2 h/day; and 31 663 (8.2%) >/=3 h/day.

In the present study, our objective was to determine the frequency and effect on gout of common and rare non-synonymous and other functional allelic variants in the ABCG2 gene. Methods: The main cohort recruited from the Czech Republic consisted of 145 gout patients; 115 normouricaemic controls were used for comparison. We amplified, directly sequenced and analysed 15 ABCG2 exons. The associations between genetic variants and clinical phenotype were analysed using the t-test, Fisher's exact test and a logistic and linear regression approach. Data from a New Zealand Polynesian sample set and the UK Biobank were included for the p.V12M analysis. Results: In the ABCG2 gene, 18 intronic (one dysfunctional splicing) and 11 exonic variants were detected: 9 were non-synonymous (2 common, 7 rare including 1 novel), namely p.V12M, p.Q141K, p.R147W, p.T153M, p.F373C, p.T434M, p.S476P, p.D620N and p.K360del. The p.Q141K (rs2231142) variant had a significantly higher minor allele frequency (0.23) in the gout patients compared with the European-origin population (0.09) and was significantly more common among gout patients than among normouricaemic controls (odds ratio = 3.26, P < 0.0001). Patients with non-synonymous allelic variants had an earlier onset of gout (42 vs 48 years, P = 0.0143) and a greater likelihood of a familial history of gout (41% vs 27%, odds ratio = 1.96, P = 0.053). In a meta-analysis p.V12M exerted a protective effect from gout (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Genetic variants of ABCG2, common and rare, increased the risk of gout. Non-synonymous allelic variants of ABCG2 had a significant effect on earlier onset of gout and the presence of a familial gout history. ABCG2 should thus be considered a common and significant risk factor for gout.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28968913","10.1093/rheumatology/kex295"

Methods: Participants were recruited to the UK Biobank; a population-based cohort. Data were collected about demographics, physical activity, iRMDs (RA, PsA, AS, SLE) and other chronic conditions, including angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, pulmonary disease, diabetes and depression. The standardized prevalence of co-morbidities in people with iRMDs was calculated. Cox regression was used to determine the relationship between the presence of an iRMD and an incident co-morbidity. The relationship between the presence (versus absence) of a (co-)morbidity and physical activity level (low, moderate, high) in people with iRMDs and in those without was assessed using multinomial logistic regression. Results: A total of 488 991 participants were included. The estimated prevalence of each co-morbidity was increased in participants with an iRMD, compared with in those without, particularly for stroke in participants with SLE (standardized morbidity ratio (95% CI), 4.9 (3.6, 6.6). Compared with people with no iRMD and no morbidity, the odds ratios (95% CI) for moderate physical activity were decreased for: no iRMD and morbidity, 0.87 (0.85, 0.89); iRMD and no co-morbidity, 0.71 (0.64, 0.80); and iRMD and co-morbidity, 0.58 (0.54, 0.63).

However, the accuracy of this method is questionable. Obtaining accurate measurements, and determining what may influence PA levels in schizophrenia, is essential to understand physical inactivity in this population. This study examined differences in self-reported and objectively measured PA in people with schizophrenia and the general population using a large, population-based dataset from the UK Biobank. Methods: Baseline data from the UK Biobank (2007-2010) were analyzed; including 1078 people with schizophrenia (54.19 +/- 8.39 years; 55% male) and 450549 without (56.44 +/- 8.11; 46% male). We compared self-reported PA with objectively measured accelerometry data in schizophrenia and comparison samples. We also examined correlations between self-report and objective measures. Results: People with schizophrenia reported the same PA levels as those without, with no differences in low, moderate, or vigorous intensity activity. However, accelerometry data showed a large and statistically significant reduction of PA in schizophrenia; as people with schizophrenia, on average, engaged in less PA than 80% of the general population. Nonetheless, within the schizophrenia sample, total self-reported PA still held significant correlations with objective measures. Conclusions: People with schizophrenia are significantly less active than the general population. However, self-report measures in epidemiological studies fail to capture the reduced activity levels in schizophrenia. This also has implications for self-report measures of other lifestyle factors which may contribute toward the poor health outcomes observed in schizophrenia. Nonetheless, self-report measures may still be useful for identifying how active individuals with schizophrenia relative to other patients.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29069474","10.1093/schbul/sbx149"

However, further population-scale research examining relationships between grip strength and cognitive performance across multiple domains is needed.

Methods: Baseline data from the UK Biobank (2007-2010) was analyzed; including 475397 individuals from the general population, and 1162 individuals with schizophrenia. Linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models were used to assess the relationship between grip strength and 5 cognitive domains (visual memory, reaction time, reasoning, prospective memory, and number memory), controlling for age, gender, bodyweight, education, and geographical region. Results: In the general population, maximal grip strength was positively and significantly related to visual memory (coefficient [coeff] = -0.1601, standard error [SE] = 0.003), reaction time (coeff = -0.0346, SE = 0.0004), reasoning (coeff = 0.2304, SE = 0.0079), number memory (coeff = 0.1616, SE = 0.0092), and prospective memory (coeff = 0.3486, SE = 0.0092: all P < .001). In the schizophrenia sample, grip strength was strongly related to visual memory (coeff = -0.155, SE = 0.042, P < .001) and reaction time (coeff = -0.049, SE = 0.009, P < .001), while prospective memory approached statistical significance (coeff = 0.233, SE = 0.132, P = .078), and no statistically significant association was found with number memory and reasoning (P > .1). Conclusions: Grip strength is significantly associated with cognitive functioning in the general population and individuals with schizophrenia, particularly for working memory and processing speed. Future research should establish directionality, examine if grip strength also predicts functional and physical health outcomes in schizophrenia, and determine whether interventions which improve muscular strength impact on cognitive and real-world functioning.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29684174","10.1093/schbul/sby034"

The present study is the first to report such data. Prevalence of tinnitus and use of hearing aids is also reported. DESIGN: The research was conducted using the UK Biobank resource. The better-ear unaided speech reception threshold was measured adaptively using the Digit Triplet Test (n = 164,770). Self-report data on tinnitus, hearing aid use, noise exposure, as well as demographic variables were collected. RESULTS: Overall, 10.7% of adults (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.5-10.9%) had significant hearing impairment. Prevalence of tinnitus was 16.9% (95%CI 16.6-17.1%) and hearing aid use was 2.0% (95%CI 1.9-2.1%). Odds of hearing impairment increased with age, with a history of work- and music-related noise exposure, for lower socioeconomic background and for ethnic minority backgrounds. Males were at no higher risk of hearing impairment than females. CONCLUSIONS: Around 1 in 10 adults aged 40 to 69 years have substantial hearing impairment. The reasons for excess risk of hearing impairment particularly for those from low socioeconomic and ethnic minority backgrounds require identification, as this represents a serious health inequality.

DESIGN: The authors used cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank to compare 1376 self-reported Meniere's participants with over 500,000 without Meniere's. The data set has comprehensive anthropometric measures, questionnaire data investigating health, well-being, diet, and medical and drug-prescribing history for each participant. The authors used logistic regression models to investigate the relationship of Meniere's disease with: demographic factors; symptoms and conditions that are known or hypothesized to be associated with Meniere's disease; other physical diseases; and mental health. RESULTS: Meniere's disease was more common in participants who were older (adjusted odds ratio per 10-year increase: 1.5 [95% confidence interval:1.4-1.6]), white (odds ratio: 1.7;1.2-2.3), female (1.4;1.3-1.6), and having higher body mass index categories (p < 0.001). The Meniere's group had greater odds of hearing difficulty (10.9;9.6-12.5), current tinnitus (68.3;47.8-97.5), and had fallen more than once in the last year (2.1;1.8-2.5). Meniere's participants had greater odds of reporting at least one disease from each grouping of allergic, immune dysfunction, or autonomic dysfunction (2.2;1.8-2.6), and poor mental health (2.1;1.8-2.5). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an evidence base that improves understanding of Meniere's disease.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank were used to compare 1,327 self-reported Meniere's cases with 479,500 controls. The authors used logistic regression models to investigate the relation of Meniere's disease with the components of adult height. Models were adjusted for a range of potential confounders including age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: In the UK Biobank, Meniere's was inversely associated with overall stature (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation increase in height, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.94) and leg length (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.94) in fully adjusted models.

This study aimed to determine the effect of functional hearing on verbal reasoning when controlling for age, gender, and education. In addition, the study investigated whether hearing aid usage mitigated the effect and examined different routes from hearing to verbal reasoning. DESIGN: Cross-sectional data on 40- to 70-year-old community-dwelling participants from the UK Biobank resource were accessed. Data consisted of behavioral and subjective measures of functional hearing, assessments of numerical and linguistic verbal reasoning, measures of executive function, and demographic and lifestyle information. Data on 119,093 participants who had completed hearing and verbal reasoning tests were submitted to multiple regression analyses, and data on 61,688 of these participants, who had completed additional cognitive tests and provided relevant lifestyle information, were submitted to structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Poorer performance on the behavioral measure of functional hearing was significantly associated with poorer verbal reasoning in both the numerical and linguistic domains (p < 0.001). There was no association between the subjective measure of functional hearing and verbal reasoning. Functional hearing significantly interacted with education (p < 0.002), showing a trend for functional hearing to have a greater impact on verbal reasoning among those with a higher level of formal education. Among those with poor hearing, hearing aid usage had a significant positive, but not necessarily causal, effect on both numerical and linguistic verbal reasoning (p < 0.005). The estimated effect of hearing aid usage was less than the effect of poor functional hearing. Structural equation modeling analyses confirmed that controlling for education reduced the effect of functional hearing on verbal reasoning and showed that controlling for executive function eliminated the effect. However, when computer usage was controlled for, the eliminating effect of executive function was weakened. CONCLUSIONS: Poor functional hearing was associated with poor verbal reasoning in a 40- to 70-year-old community-dwelling population after controlling for age, gender, and education. The effect of functional hearing on verbal reasoning was significantly reduced among hearing aid users and completely overcome by good executive function skills, which may be enhanced by playing computer games.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26244401","10.1097/AUD.0000000000000196"

DESIGN: The authors utilized a multidata approach to provide the first estimate of the cost of Meniere's. Data from the UK Biobank (a study of 500,000 individuals collected between 2007 and 2012), the Hospital Episode Statistics (data on all hospital admissions in England from 2008 to 2012) and the UK Meniere's Society (2014) were used to estimate the cost of Meniere's. Cases were self-reported in the UK Biobank and UK Meniere's Society, within the Hospital Episode Statistics cases were clinician diagnosed. The authors estimated the direct and indirect costs of the condition, using count data to represent numbers of individuals reporting specific treatments, operations etc. and basic statistical analyses (chi tests, linear and logistic regression) to compare cases and controls in the UK Biobank. RESULTS: Meniere's was estimated to cost between pound541.30 million and pound608.70 million annually (equivalent to US $829.9 to $934.2 million), equating to pound3,341 to pound3,757 ($5112 to $5748) per person per annum. The indirect costs were substantial, with loss of earnings contributing to over pound400 million per annum. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, the authors were able to estimate the economic burden of Meniere's disease. In the UK, the annual cost of this condition is substantial. Further research is required to develop cost-effective treatments and management strategies for Meniere's to reduce the economic burden of the disease.

DESIGN: The study was conducted using the UK Biobank resource, a population-based cohort of 40- to 69-year olds. Self-report data on hearing, tinnitus, sleep difficulties, and demographic variables were collected from cochlear implant users (n = 194) and individuals identified as potential candidates for cochlear implantation (n = 211). These ""candidates"" were selected based on (i) impaired hearing sensitivity, inferred from self-reported hearing aid use and (ii) impaired hearing function, inferred from an inability to report words accurately at negative signal to noise ratios on an unaided closed-set test of speech perception. Data on tinnitus (presence, persistence, and related distress) and on sleep difficulties were analyzed using logistic regression models controlling for gender, age, deprivation, and neuroticism. RESULTS: The prevalence of tinnitus was similar among implant users (50%) and candidates (52%; p = 0.39). However, implant users were less likely to report that their tinnitus was distressing at its worst (41%) compared with candidates (63%; p = 0.02). The logistic regression model suggested that this difference between the two groups could be explained by the fact that tinnitus was less persistent in implant users (46%) compared with candidates (72%; p < 0.001). Self-reported difficulties with sleep were similar among implant users (75%) and candidates (82%; p = 0.28), but participants with tinnitus were more likely to report sleep difficulties than those without (p < 0.001). The prevalence of sleep difficulties was not related to tinnitus persistence (p = 0.28) or the extent to which tinnitus was distressing (p = 0.55). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of association between tinnitus persistence and sleep difficulties is compatible with the notion that tinnitus is suppressed in implant users primarily during active electrical stimulation and may return when the implant is switched off at night time. This explanation is supported by the similar prevalence of sleep problems among implant users and potential candidates for cochlear implantation, despite differences between the groups in tinnitus persistence and related emotional distress. Cochlear implantation may therefore not be an appropriate intervention where the primary aim is to alleviate sleep difficulties.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27438865","10.1097/AUD.0000000000000341"

METHODS: We studied 180,626 women and 133,259 men participating in the UK Biobank cohort who were free of CVD at baseline. CVD events were obtained from hospital and death registers. Analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: The incidence rates of overall CVD were six per 1000 person-years for women and nine per 1000 person-years for men. Number of children showed an association with risk of CVD among women; the adjusted HR (95% CI) was 1.2 (1.1, 1.3) for one, 1.1 (1.0, 1.2) for two, 1.2 (1.1, 1.3) for three, and 1.2 (1.1, 1.4) for four or more as compared to none.

There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the associations between sexes (Pinteraction = 0.80).

BACKGROUND: Meniere's disease is an unpredictable illness that impacts on mental health. The symptom triad of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss all contribute to the disabling nature of the condition. To date, limited research has investigated the mental health and SWB impact of Meniere's disease. METHODS: We investigated the mental health and SWB of 1,376 Meniere's sufferers in the UK Biobank and compared this to over 500,000 controls. Participants in the Biobank were asked 38 questions pertaining to mental health and SWB. We utilized crude and adjusted linear and logistic regression to investigate the association between Meniere's and mental health and SWB. We also investigated how mental health and SWB might be related to length of diagnosis to see whether people might adapt to Meniere's over time. RESULTS: Meniere's was associated with increased frequency of depression, tiredness, tenseness, and unenthusiasm in the 2 weeks before recruitment. Meniere's was associated with longer periods of depression than controls (10.2 wk [95% CI: 5.2-15.2 wk]). Reduced health satisfaction was associated with Meniere's, but in other aspects of life (general happiness, work, family, friends, financial), individuals with Meniere's were as happy as controls. Mental health and SWB in individuals diagnosed for longer was better than in those who were recently diagnosed suggesting at least partial adaptation. DISCUSSION: This is the largest population study investigating the mental health impact of Meniere's. Our findings suggest that Meniere's adversely impacts on mental health, an individual's emotional state, and their life satisfaction. However, our findings raise the importance of supporting social relations for people with Meniere's and that although a cure is not currently available, we can still learn much about the adaptation strategies developed by long-term sufferers to help individuals with new diagnoses.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25730447","10.1097/MAO.0000000000000732"

Full coverage of the left ventricle (LV), from base to apex, is a basic criterion for CMR image quality and necessary for accurate measurement of cardiac volume and functional assessment. Incomplete coverage of the LV is identified through visual inspection, which is time-consuming and usually done retrospectively in the assessment of large imaging cohorts. This paper proposes a novel automatic method for determining LV coverage from CMR images by using Fisher-discriminative three-dimensional (FD3D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In contrast to our previous method employing 2D CNNs, this approach utilizes spatial contextual information in CMR volumes, extracts more representative high-level features and enhances the discriminative capacity of the baseline 2D CNN learning framework, thus achieving superior detection accuracy. A two-stage framework is proposed to identify missing basal and apical slices in measurements of CMR volume. First, the FD3D CNN extracts high-level features from the CMR stacks. These image representations are then used to detect the missing basal and apical slices. Compared to the traditional 3D CNN strategy, the proposed FD3D CNN minimizes within-class scatter and maximizes between-class scatter. We performed extensive experiments to validate the proposed method on more than 5,000 independent volumetric CMR scans from the UK Biobank study, achieving low error rates for missing basal/apical slice detection (4.9%/4.6%). The proposed method can also be adopted for assessing LV coverage for other types of CMR image data.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30475705","10.1109/TBME.2018.2881952"

It is then tested on the 756 different cases from the U.K. Biobank and three other state-of-the-art cohorts (ACDC with 100 cases, Sunnybrook with 30 cases, and RVSC with 16 cases). Results comparable or even better than the state of the art in terms of distance measures are achieved. They also emphasize the assets of our method, namely, enhanced spatial consistency (currently neither considered nor achieved by the state of the art), and the generalization ability to unseen cases even from other databases.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29994087","10.1109/TMI.2018.2820742"

In the clinical practice, a quality control step is performed by visual assessment of the acquired images; however, this procedure is strongly operator-dependent, cumbersome, and sometimes incompatible with the time constraints in clinical settings and large-scale studies. We propose a fast, fully automated, and learning-based quality control pipeline for CMR images, specifically for short-axis image stacks. Our pipeline performs three important quality checks: 1) heart coverage estimation; 2) inter-slice motion detection; 3) image contrast estimation in the cardiac region. The pipeline uses a hybrid decision forest method-integrating both regression and structured classification models-to extract landmarks and probabilistic segmentation maps from both long- and short-axis images as a basis to perform the quality checks. The technique was tested on up to 3000 cases from the UK Biobank and on 100 cases from the UK Digital Heart Project and validated against manual annotations and visual inspections performed by expert interpreters. The results show the capability of the proposed pipeline to correctly detect incomplete or corrupted scans (e.g., on UK Biobank, sensitivity and specificity, respectively, 88% and 99% for heart coverage estimation and 85% and 95% for motion detection), allowing their exclusion from the analyzed dataset or the triggering of a new acquisition.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30403623","10.1109/TMI.2018.2878509"

METHOD: Cross-sectional study using UK Biobank data (n = 502 642). Psychiatric and neurological exposure status was ascertained via self-reported diagnoses, hospital records and questionnaires. Impairment on reasoning, reaction time and memory tests was defined with reference to a single unexposed comparison group. Results were standardised for age and gender. Sensitivity analyses examined the influence of comorbidity, education, information sources and missing data. RESULTS: Relative to the unexposed group, cognitive impairment was least common in major depression (standardised prevalence ratios across tests = 1.00 [95% CI 0.98, 1.02] to 1.49 [95% CI 1.24, 1.79]) and most common in schizophrenia (1.89 [95% CI 1.47, 2.42] to 3.92 [95% CI 2.34, 6.57]). Prevalence in mania/bipolar was similar to that in multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Estimated population attributable prevalence of cognitive impairment was higher for major depression (256 per 100 000 [95% CI 130, 381]) than for all other disorders. CONCLUSION: Although the relative prevalence of cognitive impairment was lowest in major depression, the population attributable prevalence was highest overall for this group.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28387438","10.1111/acps.12733"

We sought to: (1) determine whether coffee consumption influences cigarette smoking causally, (2) estimate the magnitude of any association and (3) explore potential mechanisms. DESIGN: We used Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses of observational data, using publicly available summarized data from the Tobacco and Genetics (TAG) consortium, individual-level data from the UK Biobank and in-vitro experiments of candidate compounds. SETTING: The TAG consortium includes data from studies in several countries. The UK Biobank includes data from men and women recruited across England, Wales and Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: The TAG consortium provided data on n </= 38 181 participants. The UK Biobank provided data on 8072 participants. MEASUREMENTS: In MR analyses, the exposure was coffee consumption (cups/day) and the outcome was heaviness of smoking (cigarettes/day). In our in-vitro experiments we assessed the effect of caffeic acid, quercetin and p-coumaric acid on the rate of nicotine metabolism in human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed human CYP2A6. FINDINGS: Two-sample MR analyses of TAG consortium data indicated that heavier coffee consumption might lead to reduced heaviness of smoking [beta = -1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -2.88 to -0.09]. However, in-vitro experiments found that the compounds investigated are unlikely to inhibit significantly the rate of nicotine metabolism following coffee consumption. Further MR analyses in UK Biobank found no evidence of a causal relationship between coffee consumption and heaviness of smoking (beta = 0.20, 95% CI = -1.72 to 2.12). CONCLUSIONS: Amount of coffee consumption is unlikely to have a major causal impact upon amount of cigarette smoking. If it does influence smoking, this is not likely to operate via effects of caffeic acid, quercetin or p-coumaric acid on nicotine metabolism. The observational association between coffee consumption and cigarette smoking may be due to smoking impacting on coffee consumption or confounding.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28556459","10.1111/add.13888"

DESIGN: Observational study of the association of genetic risk scores for coffee consumption with different types of non-alcoholic beverage consumption. SETTING: UK general population. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals of European ancestry aged 40-73 years from the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010 (n = 114 316). MEASUREMENTS: Genetic risk scores were constructed using two, four and eight independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of coffee consumption. Drinks were self-reported in a baseline questionnaire (all participants) and in detailed 24 dietary recall questionnaires in a subset (n = 48 692). FINDINGS: Genetic risk scores explained up to 0.38, 0.19 and 0.76% of the variance in coffee, tea and combined coffee and tea consumption, respectively. Genetic risk scores demonstrated positive associations with both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and tea consumption, and with most subtypes of coffee consumption, but only with standard tea consumption. There was no clear evidence for positive associations with most other non-alcoholic beverages, but higher genetic risk for coffee consumption was associated with lower daily water consumption. The genetic risk scores were associated with increased alcohol consumption, but not consistently with other socio-demographic and life-style factors. CONCLUSIONS: Coffee-related genetic risk scores could be used as instruments for combined coffee and tea consumption in Mendelian randomization studies. However, associations observed with alcohol consumption require further investigation to determine whether these are due to causal effects of coffee and tea consumption or biological pleiotropy.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28793181","10.1111/add.13975"

We examined the causal effect of BMI on asthma, hay fever, allergic sensitization, serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE), forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). METHODS: We included 490 497 participants in the observational and 162 124 participants in the genetic analyses. A genetic risk score (GRS) was created using 26 BMI-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Results were pooled in meta-analyses and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) or beta-estimates with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The GRS was significantly associated with asthma (OR=1.009; 95% CI: 1.004, 1.013), but not with hay fever (OR= 0.998; 95% CI: 0.994, 1.002) or allergic sensitization (OR=0.999; 95% CI: 0.986, 1.012) per BMI-increasing allele.

METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study within the Primary Care Clinical Informatics Unit (PCCIU) database in which up to five controls were matched to cases with primary liver cancer, recorded by General Practitioners. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations with prescribed PPIs and H2RAs were calculated using conditional logistic regression. We also conducted a prospective cohort study within the UK Biobank using self-reported medication use and cancer-registry recorded primary liver cancer. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated using Cox regression. RESULTS: In the PCCIU case-control analysis, 434 liver cancer cases were matched to 2103 controls.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study used baseline data from the UK Biobank study on 418 656 white European, black and South-Asian participants, aged 40-69 years, who had complete data on diabetes status and hand-grip strength. Associations between hand-grip strength and diabetes were assessed using logistic regression and were adjusted for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Lower grip strength was associated with higher prevalence of diabetes, independent of confounding factors, across all ethnicities in both men and women. Diabetes prevalence was approximately three- to fourfold higher in South-Asian and two- to threefold higher in black participants compared with white European participants across all levels of grip strength, but grip strength in South-Asian men and women was ~ 5-6 kg lower than in the other ethnic groups. Thus, the attributable risk for diabetes associated with low grip strength was substantially higher in South-Asian participants (3.9 and 4.2 cases per 100 men and women, respectively) than in white participants (2.0 and 0.6 cases per 100 men and women, respectively). Attributable risk associated with low grip strength was also high in black men (4.3 cases) but not in black women (0.4 cases). CONCLUSIONS: Low strength is associated with a disproportionately large number of diabetes cases in South-Asian men and women and in black men.

A previous study analysed the dietary intake in people consuming a reduced-carbohydrate diet (<40% calories). However, it is not clear what foods people consume when carbohydrate is reduced to below 26% of total calories. METHODS: In the present cross-sectional study, the dietary and nutrient intake collected via up to five consecutive 24-h dietary recalls and a food frequency questionnaire of 444 individuals (aged 46-79 years) consuming <26% of calories from carbohydrate (LCHO) was compared with that of 131 897 individuals consuming >/=45% calories from carbohydrate (NCHO) using the UK Biobank Dataset. Absolute cut-offs to define the low-carbohydrate group (<130 g day(-1) ; n = 1953 versus >/=225 g day(-1) , n = 113 036) were also used. RESULTS: Both NCHO (>45% calories and >/=225 g) groups consumed significantly more high-sugar, high-fat snacks [median 6.0, interquartile range (IQR) = 2.0-11.0 and median 6.0, IQR = 3.0-11.8, respectively) compared to the LCHO (<26% calories and <130 g) groups (median 0, IQR = 0-2.8 and median 1, IQR = 0-3.8, respectively) (P < 0.0001). Both LCHO groups reported consuming significantly more red meat, oily fish, nuts and seeds but fewer fruits, vegetables and pulses compared to the NCHO groups. In general, the consumption of oily fish, nuts, seeds and pulses was low across the whole cohort and differences in intake between the LCHO and NCHO groups were small. After adjusting for socio-economic status, most differences remained. CONCLUSIONS: Carbohydrate restriction is associated with both beneficial and potentially deleterious dietary changes compared to a normal carbohydrate intake.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29235157","10.1111/jhn.12527"

In this study we describe the prevalence of vision impairment and dual sensory impairment in UK adults aged 40-69 years in a very large and recently ascertained data set. The associations between vision impairment, age, sex, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity are reported. METHODS: This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource, with subsets of UK Biobank data analysed with respect to self-report of eye problems and glasses use. Better-eye visual acuity with habitually worn refractive correction was assessed with a logMAR chart (n = 116,682). Better-ear speech reception threshold was measured with an adaptive speech in noise test, the Digit Triplet Test (n = 164,770). Prevalence estimates were weighted with respect to UK 2001 Census data. RESULTS: Prevalence of mild visual impairment (VA >0.1 logMAR (6/7.5, 20/25) and >/=0.48 (6/18, 20/60)) and low vision (VA >0.48 (6/18, 20/60) and >/=1.3 (6/120, 20/400)) was estimated at 13.1% (95% CI 12.9-13.4) and 0.8% (95% CI 0.7-0.9), respectively. Use of glasses was 88.0% (95% CI 87.9-88.1). The prevalence of dual sensory impairment was 3.1% (95% CI 3.0-3.2) and there was a nine-fold increase in the prevalence of dual sensory problems between the youngest and oldest age groups. Older adults, those from low socioeconomic and ethnic minority backgrounds were most at risk for vision problems. CONCLUSIONS: Mild vision impairment is common in middle aged UK adults, despite widespread use of spectacles. Increased likelihood of vision impairment with older age and with ethnic minorities is of concern given ageing and more ethnically diverse populations. Possible barriers to optometric care for those from low socioeconomic and ethnic minority backgrounds may require attention. A higher than expected prevalence of dual impairment suggests that hearing and vision problems share common causes. Optometrists should consider screening for hearing problems, particularly among older adults.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888710","10.1111/opo.12138"

The UK Biobank cohort was used for this nested case-control study (N = 3732). Primary, incident esophageal and gastric cancer cases diagnosed after recruitment were identified via linkage to National Cancer Registries. Tropospheric Emissions Monitoring Internet Service database was used to calculate ambient annual UVB dose (D-UVB). Conditional logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between annual ambient D-UVB and risk of esophageal and gastric cancer, and odds ratios (ORs) are reported. In total, 373 esophageal and 249 gastric cancer cases and 3110 age- and gender-matched controls were included in the study. We found a strong inverse association between annual ambient D-UVB and odds of developing esophageal or gastric cancer: Compared to the lowest tertile, OR for the highest tertile was 0.64 (95%CI:0.51-0.79) in adjusted analysis. The association was strengthened when restricted to esophageal cancer (OR = 0.60; 95%CI:0.45-0.80) and esophageal adenocarcinoma cases (OR = 0.48; 95%CI: 0.34-0.68). Similar results were found in unadjusted and stratified analysis. In conclusion, ambient UVB radiation is inversely associated with the development of esophageal and gastric cancer, even in a high-latitude country.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29485201","10.1111/php.12915"

Using the largest study conducted, we determine whether such a relationship exists, estimate its magnitude and establish what factors mediate any relationship. METHODS: UK Biobank, a cohort study of 0.5 million people aged 40-69 years, recruited throughout Great Britain in 2006-2010. Participants reporting 'pain all over the body' for >3 months were compared with persons without chronic pain. Information on death (with cause) was available until mid-2015. We incorporated these results in a meta-analysis with other published reports to calculate a pooled estimate of excess risk. RESULTS: 7130 participants reported CWP and they experienced excess mortality (mortality risk ratio 2.43, 95%CI 2.17 to 2.72). Specific causes of death in excess were cancer (1.73adjusted age and sex, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.05), cardiovascular (3.24adjusted age and sex, 95% CI 2.55 to 4.11), respiratory (5.66adjusted age and sex, 95% CI 4.00 to 8.03) and other disease-related causes (4.04adjusted age and sex, 95% CI 3.05 to 5.34). Excess risk was substantially reduced after adjustment for low levels of physical activity, high body mass index, poor quality diet and smoking. In meta-analysis, all studies showed significant excess all-cause (combined estimate 1.59 (95% CI 1.05 to 2.42)), cardiovascular and cancer mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is now clear that persons with CWP experience excess mortality. UK Biobank results considerably reduce uncertainty around the magnitude of excess risk and are consistent with the excess being explained by adverse lifestyle factors, which could be targeted in the management of such patients.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28733474","10.1136/annrheumdis-2017-211476"

To identify novel susceptibility loci for OA, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in individuals from the largest UK-based OA collections to date. METHODS: We carried out a discovery GWAS in 5414 OA individuals with knee and/or hip total joint replacement (TJR) and 9939 population-based controls. We followed-up prioritised variants in OA subjects from the interim release of the UK Biobank resource (up to 12 658 cases and 50 898 controls) and our lead finding in operated OA subjects from the full release of UK Biobank (17 894 cases and 89 470 controls). We investigated its functional implications in methylation, gene expression and proteomics data in primary chondrocytes from 12 pairs of intact and degraded cartilage samples from patients undergoing TJR. RESULTS: We detect a genome-wide significant association at rs10116772 with TJR (P=3.7x10(-8); for allele A: OR (95% CI) 0.97 (0.96 to 0.98)), an intronic variant in GLIS3, which is expressed in cartilage. Variants in strong correlation with rs10116772 have been associated with elevated plasma glucose levels and diabetes.

METHODS: We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to identify disease outcomes associated with SUA genetic risk loci. We then implemented conventional Mendelianrandomisation (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relevance between SUA level and disease outcomes identified from PheWAS. We next applied MR Egger analysis to detect and account for potential pleiotropy, which conventional MR analysis might mistake for causality, and used the HEIDI (heterogeneity in dependent instruments) test to remove cross-phenotype associations that were likely due to genetic linkage. RESULTS: Our PheWAS identified 25 disease groups/outcomes associated with SUA genetic risk loci after multiple testing correction (P<8.57e-05). Our conventional MR analysis implicated a causal role of SUA level in three disease groups: inflammatory polyarthropathies (OR=1.22, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.34), hypertensive disease (OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.14) and disorders of metabolism (OR=1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14); and four disease outcomes: gout (OR=4.88, 95% CI 3.91 to 6.09), essential hypertension (OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.14), myocardial infarction (OR=1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.30) and coeliac disease (OR=1.41, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.89). After balancing pleiotropic effects in MR Egger analysis, only gout and its encompassing disease group of inflammatory polyarthropathies were considered to be causally associated with SUA level. Our analysis highlighted a locus (ATXN2/S2HB3) that may influence SUA level and multiple cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases via pleiotropy. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated SUA level is convincing to cause gout and inflammatory polyarthropathies, and might act as a marker for the wider range of diseases with which it associates. Our findings support further investigation on the clinical relevance of SUA level with cardiovascular, metabolic, autoimmune and respiratory diseases.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29437585","10.1136/annrheumdis-2017-212534"

Our secondary objective was to assess the statistical power of nested case-control studies of these eye diseases. We aimed to provide quantitative information relevant to UK Biobank's eye disease case ascertainment efforts and to the potential for UK Biobank-based research into the causes of eye disease. METHODS: We constructed a Markov discrete-time state transition model to simulate the population dynamics of the eye disorders within the UK Biobank cohort, using prevalence data from population-based epidemiological studies to derive incidence, and Office for National Statistics data on mortality and migration overseas. RESULTS: By 2023, >900 new cases of each of 'wet' (neovascular) and 'dry' age-related macular degeneration, >1200 cases of primary open angle glaucoma and almost 15 000 cases of cataracts are expected to have accrued in the subcohort of 68 500 participants who had ocular assessment at baseline, with around seven times as many cases of each disease in the whole cohort of 500 000 participants. These predicted incident case numbers generate good or substantial statistical power for a range of nested case-control studies of potential genetic, lifestyle and environmental determinants of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Over the next few years, UK Biobank is expected to generate sufficient numbers of new cases for statistically well-powered studies of the determinants of the major causes of sight loss: age-related macular degeneration, vision-impairing cataract and glaucoma.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29437582","10.1136/bjophthalmol-2017-311289"

DESIGN: Mendelian randomisation study to test for causal effects of differences in stature and BMI on five measures of socioeconomic status. Mendelian randomisation exploits the fact that genotypes are randomly assigned at conception and thus not confounded by non-genetic factors. SETTING: UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 119,669 men and women of British ancestry, aged between 37 and 73 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age completed full time education, degree level education, job class, annual household income, and Townsend deprivation index. RESULTS: In the UK Biobank study, shorter stature and higher BMI were observationally associated with several measures of lower socioeconomic status. The associations between shorter stature and lower socioeconomic status tended to be stronger in men, and the associations between higher BMI and lower socioeconomic status tended to be stronger in women. For example, a 1 standard deviation (SD) higher BMI was associated with a pound210 (euro276; $300; 95% confidence interval pound84 to pound420; P=6 x 10(-3)) lower annual household income in men and a pound1890 ( pound1680 to pound2100; P=6 x 10(-15)) lower annual household income in women. Genetic analysis provided evidence that these associations were partly causal. A genetically determined 1 SD (6.3 cm) taller stature caused a 0.06 (0.02 to 0.09) year older age of completing full time education (P=0.01), a 1.12 (1.07 to 1.18) times higher odds of working in a skilled profession (P=6 x 10(-7)), and a pound1130 ( pound680 to pound1580) higher annual household income (P=4 x 10(-8)). Associations were stronger in men. A genetically determined 1 SD higher BMI (4.6 kg/m(2)) caused a pound2940 ( pound1680 to pound4200; P=1 x 10(-5)) lower annual household income and a 0.10 (0.04 to 0.16) SD (P=0.001) higher level of deprivation in women only. CONCLUSIONS: These data support evidence that height and BMI play an important partial role in determining several aspects of a person's socioeconomic status, especially women's BMI for income and deprivation and men's height for education, income, and job class. These findings have important social and health implications, supporting evidence that overweight people, especially women, are at a disadvantage and that taller people, especially men, are at an advantage.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26956984","10.1136/bmj.i582"

RESULTS: Of the participants included in analyses, 13 322 (2.7%) died over a mean of 7.1 (range 5.3-9.9) years' follow-up. In women and men, respectively, hazard ratios per 5 kg lower grip strength were higher (all at P<0.05) for all cause mortality (1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.23, and 1.16, 1.15 to 1.17) and cause specific mortality from cardiovascular disease (1.19, 1.13 to 1.25, and 1.22, 1.18 to 1.26), all respiratory disease (1.31, 1.22 to 1.40, and 1.24, 1.20 to 1.28), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.24, 1.05 to 1.47, and 1.19, 1.09 to 1.30), all cancer (1.17, 1.13 to 1.21, 1.10, 1.07 to 1.13), colorectal cancer (1.17, 1.04 to 1.32, and 1.18, 1.09 to 1.27), lung cancer (1.17, 1.07 to 1.27, and 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), and breast cancer (1.24, 1.10 to 1.39) but not prostate cancer (1.05, 0.96 to 1.15). Several of these relations had higher hazard ratios in the younger age group. Muscle weakness (defined as grip strength <26 kg for men and <16 kg for women) was associated with a higher hazard for all health outcomes, except colon cancer in women and prostate cancer and lung cancer in both men and women. The addition of handgrip strength improved the prediction ability, based on C index change, of an office based risk score (age, sex, diabetes diagnosed, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and smoking) for all cause (0.013) and cardiovascular mortality (0.012) and incidence of cardiovascular disease (0.009). CONCLUSION: Higher grip strength was associated with a range of health outcomes and improved prediction of an office based risk score. Further work on the use of grip strength in risk scores or risk screening is needed to establish its potential clinical utility.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29739772","10.1136/bmj.k1651"

DESIGN: Mendelian randomisation study. SETTING: UK Biobank, with replication of results from the Tobacco and Genetics (TAG) consortium. PARTICIPANTS: European descent participants from the UK Biobank cohort (n=372 791) and the TAG consortium (n=74 035). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of current and past smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day, age of smoking initiation. RESULTS: The Mendelian randomisation analysis indicated that each standard deviation increment in body mass index (4.6) increased the risk of being a smoker (odds ratio 1.18 (95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.23), P<0.001). This association was replicated in the TAG consortium data (1.19 (1.06 to 1.33), P=0.003). Furthermore, each standard deviation increment in body mass index was estimated to increase smoking intensity by 0.88 cigarettes per day (95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.26, P<0.001) in UK Biobank and 1.27 cigarettes per day in the TAG consortium (0.46 to 2.07, P=0.002).

DESIGN: Bidirectional, two sample mendelian randomisation study. SETTING: Publically available genetic data from two consortiums applied to a large, independent population cohort. Genetic variants used as proxies for myopia and years of education were derived from two large genome wide association studies: 23andMe and Social Science Genetic Association Consortium (SSGAC), respectively. PARTICIPANTS: 67 798 men and women from England, Scotland, and Wales in the UK Biobank cohort with available information for years of completed education and refractive error. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mendelian randomisation analyses were performed in two directions: the first exposure was the genetic predisposition to myopia, measured with 44 genetic variants strongly associated with myopia in 23andMe, and the outcome was years in education; and the second exposure was the genetic predisposition to higher levels of education, measured with 69 genetic variants from SSGAC, and the outcome was refractive error. RESULTS: Conventional regression analyses of the observational data suggested that every additional year of education was associated with a more myopic refractive error of -0.18 dioptres/y (95% confidence interval -0.19 to -0.17; P<2e-16). Mendelian randomisation analyses suggested the true causal effect was even stronger: -0.27 dioptres/y (-0.37 to -0.17; P=4e-8). By contrast, there was little evidence to suggest myopia affected education (years in education per dioptre of refractive error -0.008 y/dioptre, 95% confidence interval -0.041 to 0.025, P=0.6). Thus, the cumulative effect of more years in education on refractive error means that a university graduate from the United Kingdom with 17 years of education would, on average, be at least -1 dioptre more myopic than someone who left school at age 16 (with 12 years of education). Myopia of this magnitude would be sufficient to necessitate the use of glasses for driving. Sensitivity analyses showed minimal evidence for genetic confounding that could have biased the causal effect estimates. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that exposure to more years in education contributes to the rising prevalence of myopia. Increasing the length of time spent in education may inadvertently increase the prevalence of myopia and potential future visual disability.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29875094","10.1136/bmj.k2022"

DESIGN: Two sample, bidirectional mendelian randomisation study. SETTING: Genetic data taken from various cohorts comprised of the general population (mostly individuals of European ancestry, plus a small proportion of other ancestries); follow-up analysis included individuals from the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Summary data were used from previous genome wide association studies (number of participants ranging from 83 198 to 339 224), which investigated traits related to cardiovascular or metabolic health, had the largest sample sizes, and consisted of the most similar populations while minimising sample overlap. A follow-up analysis included 337 112 individuals from the UK Biobank (54% female (n=181 363), mean age 56.87 years (standard deviation 8.00) at recruitment). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjective wellbeing and 11 measures of cardiometabolic health (coronary artery disease; myocardial infarction; total, high density lipoprotein, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol; diastolic and systolic blood pressure; body fat; waist to hip ratio; waist circumference; and body mass index). RESULTS: Evidence of a causal effect of body mass index on subjective wellbeing was seen; each 1 kg/m(2) increase in body mass index caused a -0.045 (95% confidence interval -0.084 to -0.006, P=0.02) standard deviation reduction in subjective wellbeing. Follow-up analysis of this association in an independent sample from the UK Biobank provided strong evidence of an effect of body mass index on satisfaction with health (beta=-0.035 unit decrease in health satisfaction (95% confidence interval -0.043 to -0.027) per standard deviation increase in body mass index, P<0.001). No clear evidence of a causal effect was seen between subjective wellbeing and the other cardiometabolic health measures, in either direction. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a higher body mass index is associated with a lower subjective wellbeing. A follow-up analysis confirmed this finding, suggesting that the effect in middle aged people could be driven by satisfaction with health. Body mass index is a modifiable determinant, and therefore, this study provides further motivation to tackle the obesity epidemic because of the knock-on effects of higher body mass index on subjective wellbeing.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30254091","10.1136/bmj.k3788"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hazard ratios for a first stroke, estimated using Cox regression. A polygenic risk score of 90 single nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with stroke was constructed at P<1x10(-5) to test for an association with incident stroke. Adherence to a healthy lifestyle was determined on the basis of four factors: non-smoker, healthy diet, body mass index <30 kg/m(2), and regular physical exercise. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.1 years (2 138 443 person years), 2077 incident strokes (1541 ischaemic stroke, 287 intracerebral haemorrhage, and 249 subarachnoid haemorrhage) were ascertained. The risk of incident stroke was 35% higher among those at high genetic risk (top third of polygenic score) compared with those at low genetic risk (bottom third): hazard ratio 1.35 (95% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.50), P=3.9x10(-8). Unfavourable lifestyle (0 or 1 healthy lifestyle factors) was associated with a 66% increased risk of stroke compared with a favourable lifestyle (3 or 4 healthy lifestyle factors): 1.66 (1.45 to 1.89), P=1.19x10(-13). The association with lifestyle was independent of genetic risk stratums. CONCLUSION: In this cohort study, genetic and lifestyle factors were independently associated with incident stroke.

DESIGN: Prospective population based study. SETTING: UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 471 998 participants (56% women; mean age 56.2) with no history of cardiovascular disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident (fatal and non-fatal) MI. RESULTS: 5081 participants (1463 (28.8%) of whom were women) had MI over seven years' mean follow-up, resulting in an incidence per 10 000 person years of 7.76 (95% confidence interval 7.37 to 8.16) for women and 24.35 (23.57 to 25.16) for men. Higher blood pressure indices, smoking intensity, body mass index, and the presence of diabetes were associated with an increased risk of MI in men and women, but associations were attenuated with age. In women, systolic blood pressure and hypertension, smoking status and intensity, and diabetes were associated with higher hazard ratios for MI compared with men: ratio of hazard ratios 1.09 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.16) for systolic blood pressure, 1.55 (1.32 to 1.83) for current smoking, 2.91 (1.56 to 5.45) for type 1 diabetes, and 1.47 (1.16 to 1.87) for type 2 diabetes. There was no evidence that any of these ratios of hazard ratios decreased with age (P>0.2). With the exception of type 1 diabetes, the incidence of MI was higher in men than in women for all risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of MI was higher in men than in women, several risk factors were more strongly associated with MI in women compared with men. Sex specific associations between risk factors and MI declined with age, but, where it occurred, the higher relative risk in women remained. As the population ages and the prevalence of lifestyle associated risk factors increase, the incidence of MI in women will likely become more similar to that in men.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404896","10.1136/bmj.k4247"

The reasons for this excess risk of smoking in women are unclear, yet sex differences in smoking habits may play a role. We, thus, characterised sex differences in smoking habits in a contemporary Western population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional population-based study. SETTING: UK Biobank Resource. PARTICIPANTS: 499,797 (54% women) individuals with data on smoking habits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women-to-men prevalence ratios in smoking status, and the women-minus-men mean difference in age at smoking initiation, number of cigarettes smoked daily and age at smoking cessation in 5-year birth cohort bands. RESULTS: The women-to-men ever-smoking ratio ranged from 0.57 in the oldest to 0.87 in the youngest birth cohort. In the oldest cohort, born 1935-1939, women started smoking 1.9 years (95% CI 1.7 to 2.1) later than did men, but in those born after 1959 there was no difference in the age at initiation. The oldest women smoked 5.3 (95% CI 4.7 to 5.9) cigarettes per day fewer than did the oldest men, compared with 2.0 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.3) fewer cigarettes smoked per day in the youngest, born 1965-1969. Among quitters, women born before 1945 were, on average, 1.5 years older than their male contemporaries, but this differential was 1 year or less among people born after 1949. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in smoking behaviour between women and men have decreased over time. Even past differentials are unlikely to explain the increased susceptibility to smoking-related chronic disease in women compared with men that has previously been observed. Future studies are required to determine whether sex differences in the physiological and biological effects of smoking are responsible for the differential impact of smoking on health in women and men.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25550291","10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005663"

METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 480,813 participants from the UK Biobank without history of CVD was conducted to assess whether the difference in body size in people with and without diabetes was greater in women than in men. Age-adjusted linear regression analyses were used to obtain the mean difference in women minus men in the difference in body size measures, separately for type I and II diabetes. RESULTS: Body size was higher in individuals with diabetes than in individuals without diabetes, particularly in type II diabetes. Differences in body size between individuals with and without type II diabetes were more extreme in women than in men; compared to those without type II diabetes, body mass index and waist circumference were 1.94 (95% CI 1.82 to 2.07) and 4.84 (4.53 to 5.16) higher in women than in men, respectively. In type I diabetes, body size differed to a similar extent between those with and without diabetes in women as in men. This pattern was observed across all prespecified subgroups.

Models were adjusted for gender, age, body mass index, Townsend Deprivation Index, ethnicity, alcohol intake, smoking and meeting fruit/vegetable guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Low physical activity, high TV and poor sleep duration are prominent unaddressed high-risk characteristics of both CVD and type 2 diabetes, and are likely to be clustered together.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27008686","10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010038"

DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of participants recruited into UK Biobank in 2006-2010. SETTING: UK Biobank assessment centres throughout the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 119 230 men and 140 578 women aged 40-69 years, with complete physical activity information, and without a self-reported long-term illness, disability or infirmity. EXPOSURES: Physical activity measured as excess metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours per week, estimated from a combination of walking, and moderate and vigorous physical activity. BMI from measured height and weight. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Body fat percentage estimated from bioimpedance. RESULTS: BMI and body fat percentage were highly correlated (r=0.85 in women; r=0.79 in men), and both were inversely associated with physical activity. Compared with <5 excess MET-hours/week at baseline, >/=100 excess MET-hours/week were associated with a 1.1 kg/m(2) lower BMI (27.1 vs 28.2 kg/m(2)) and 2.8 percentage points lower body fat (23.4% vs 26.3%) in men, and 2.2 kg/m(2) lower BMI (25.6 vs 27.7 kg/m(2)) and 4.0 percentage points lower body fat (33.9% vs 37.9%) in women. For a given BMI, greater physical activity was associated with lower average body fat percentage (for a BMI of 22.5-24.99 kg/m(2): 2.0 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.2), percentage points lower body fat in men and 1.8 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.0) percentage points lower body fat in women, comparing >/=100 excess MET-hours per week with <5 excess MET-hours/week). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of middle-aged adults, drawn from the general population, physical activity was inversely associated with BMI and body fat percentage.

DESIGN: Population-based cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: UK Biobank participants aged 37-73 years who completed cognitive tests at the baseline visit in 2006-2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive test outcomes on verbal-numerical reasoning test (n=165 493), memory test (n=482 766) and reaction time test (n=496 813). RESULTS: Most drugs (262 of 368) were not associated with any cognitive tests after adjusting for age, gender, education, household income, smoking, alcohol status, psychostimulant/nootropic medication use, assessment centre, and concurrent diagnoses and medications. Drugs used for nervous system disorders were associated with poorer cognitive performance (antiepileptics, eg, topiramate breasoning(score) -0.65 (95% CI -1.05 to -0.24), bmemory(score) -1.41 (-1.79 to -1.04); antipsychotics, eg, risperidone breaction time(ms) -33 (-46 to -20), negative values indicate poor cognitive performance and vice versa). Drugs used for non-nervous system conditions also showed significant negative association with cognitive score, including those where such an association might have been predicted (antihypertensives, eg, amlodipine breasoning -0.1 (-0.15 to -0.06), bmemory -0.08 (-0.13 to -0.03), breaction time -3 (-5 to -2); antidiabetics, eg, insulin breaction time -13 (-17 to -10)) and others where such an association was a surprising observation (proton pump inhibitors, eg, omeprazole breasoning -0.11 (-0.15 to -0.06), bmemory -0.08 (-0.12 to -0.04), breaction time -5 (-6 to -3); laxatives, eg, contact laxatives breaction time -13 (-19 to -8)).

CONCLUSIONS: In this large volunteer study, some commonly prescribed medications were associated with poor cognitive performance. Some associations may reflect underlying diseases for which the medications were prescribed, although the analysis controlled for the possible effect of diagnosis.

We sought to verify this in lifelong non-smokers, among whom confounding by active smoking can be excluded, and investigate associations with circulatory and cancer deaths. METHODS: In UK Biobank, among 149 343 white never-smokers aged 40-69 years at entry, 2401 deaths occurred over a mean of 6.5-year follow-up. In the Health Surveys for England (HSE) 1995, 1996, 2001 and Scottish Health Surveys (SHS) 1998 and 2003 combined, there were 500 deaths among 6579 white never-smokers aged 40-69 years at entry, followed for a mean of 13.9 years. SD (z) scores for forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were derived using Global Lung Initiative 2012 reference equations. These z-scores were related to deaths from all causes, circulatory disease and cancers using proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, height, socioeconomic status, region and survey. RESULTS: In the HSE-SHS data set, decreasing z-scores for FEV1 (zFEV1) and FVC (zFVC) were each associated to a similar degree with increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratios per unit decrement 1.17, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25 for zFEV1 and 1.19, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.28 for zFVC). This was replicated in Biobank (HRs 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.26 and 1.24, 1.19 to 1.29, respectively). zFEV1 and zFVC were less strongly associated with mortality from circulatory diseases in HSE-SHS (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.40 for zFVC) than in Biobank (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.60 for zFVC). For cancer mortality, HRs were more consistent between cohorts (for zFVC: HRs 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.24 in HSE-SHS and 1.10, 1.05 to 1.15 in Biobank). The strongest associations were with respiratory mortality (for zFVC: HRs 1.61, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.08 in HSE-SHS and 2.15, 1.77 to 2.61 in Biobank). CONCLUSIONS: Spirometric indices predicted mortality more strongly than systolic blood pressure or body mass index, emphasising the importance of promoting lung health in the general population, even among lifelong non-smokers.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28706094","10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015381"

Social and environmental correlates of AC will also be explored. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a cohort study. SETTINGS: This is a population cohort of over 500 000 people recruited from 22 centres across the UK. Participants aged between 37 and 73 years were recruited between 2006 and 2010. PARTICIPANTS: 6896 participants with a self-reported type 2 diabetes diagnosis who reported commuting to work and had complete covariate data were included in the analysis. EXPOSURE MEASURES: Exposure measures were AC to work, measured as usual mode of transport. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), hours/day of sedentary time and participation in active travel. RESULTS: AC (reporting walking or cycling to work only) was reported by 5.5% of participants, with the great majority using the car to commute (80%). AC was associated with an additional 73 (95% CI 10.8 to 134.9) and 105 (95% CI 41.7 to 167.2) weekly minutes of MVPA for men and women, respectively. AC was associated with reduced sedentary time (beta -1.1, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7 hours/day for men; and beta -0.8, 95% CI -1.2 to -0.3 hours/day for women). Deprivation and distance from home to work were identified as correlates of AC behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of AC are very low in adults with type 2 diabetes. However, AC offers a potentially sustainable solution to increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour. Therefore, strategies to improve the environment and encourage AC may help to increase population levels of physical activity and reduce the disease burden associated with type 2 diabetes.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28993386","10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017132"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Community cohort. PARTICIPANTS: UK Biobank participants comparing self-reported COPD (n=8317) with no COPD (n=494 323). OUTCOMES: Multimorbidity (>/=4 conditions) and polypharmacy (>/=5 medications) in participants with COPD versus those without. Risk of ADRs (taking >/=3 medications associated with falls, constipation, urinary retention, central nervous system (CNS) depression, bleeding or renal injury) in relation to the presence of COPD and individual comorbidities. RESULTS: Multimorbidity was more common in participants with COPD than those without (17% vs 4%).

Adjusting for age, sex and socioeconomic status, those with COPD were significantly more likely than those without to be prescribed >/=3 medications contributing to falls (OR 2.27, 95% CI 2.13 to 2.42), constipation (OR 3.42, 95% CI 3.10 to 3.77), urinary retention (OR 3.38, 95% CI 2.94 to 3.87), CNS depression (OR 3.75, 95% CI 3.31 to 4.25), bleeding (OR 4.61, 95% CI 3.35 to 6.19) and renal injury (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.62). Concomitant cardiovascular disease was associated with the greatest risk of taking >/=3 medications associated with falls/renal injury. Concomitant mental health conditions were most strongly associated with medications linked with CNS depression/urinary retention/bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity is common in COPD and associated with high levels of polypharmacy. Co-prescription of drugs with various ADRs is common. Future research should examine the effects on healthcare outcomes of co-prescribing multiple drugs with similar potential ADRs. Clinical guidelines should emphasise assessment of multimorbidity and ADR risk.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29332840","10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018404"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data collected as part of the UK Biobank. The UK Biobank is a population cohort recruited from 22 centres across the UK. Participants aged between 37 and 73 years were recruited between 2006 and 2010. METHODS: Decision tree models were generated for the sedentary behaviour outcomes of hours/day spent television viewing, recreational computer use and all driving; a sum of time spent in these sedentary behaviours ('overall') was computed. Age, sex, race, college attendance, employment, shift-work, urban versus rural residence as well as physical activity were considered as predictors. RESULTS: The analytic sample comprised 415 666 adults who were mostly female (54.2%), white (95.2%), non-college attendee (64.5%), employed (61.7%), lived in an urban centre (85.5%), with a mean age of 56.6 (SD=8.1) years. Television viewing was most common sedentary behaviour (2.7 hour/day vs 1.1 for recreational computer use and 1.0 for all driving). Males (tier 1), who did not attend college (tier 2) were the highest risk group for overall sedentary time. Adults with no college attendance (tier 1) and were retired (tier 2) were the most high-risk demographic group for television viewing. College attendees (tier 1) were highest risk for recreational computer use. Adults who were employed (tier 1), male (tier 2) and did not attend college (tier 3) were most at risk for driving CONCLUSIONS: Daily time spent in different sedentary behaviours varies by sex, employment status and college attendance status.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women-to-men mean differences in nutrient intake in grams and as a percentage of energy and women-to-men ORs in non-adherence, adjusting for age, socioeconomic status and ethnicity. RESULTS: There were sex differences in energy intake and distribution. Men had greater intakes of energy and were less likely to have energy intakes above the estimated average requirement compared with women. Small, but significant, sex differences were found in the intakes of all macronutrients. For all macronutrients, men had greater absolute intakes while women had greater intakes as a percentage of energy. Women were more likely to have intakes that exceeded recommendations for total fat, saturated fat and total sugar. Men were less likely to achieve the minimum recommended intakes for protein, polyunsaturated fat and total carbohydrate. Over 95% of men and women were non-adherent to fibre recommendations. Sex differences in dietary intakes were moderated by age and to some extent by socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant sex differences in adherence to dietary recommendations, particularly for sugar. However, given the increased focus on food groups and dietary patterns for nutritional policy, these differences alone may not be sufficient for policy and health promotion. Future studies that are able to explore the sex differences in intakes of different food groups that are risk factors for diet-related diseases are warranted to improve the current understanding of the differential impact of diet on health in women and men.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29691247","10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020017"

The prevalence and contribution of VRIA to visual impairment was determined and multinomial logistic regression models were used to investigate association with known risk factors and other predetermined socioeconomic, biometric, lifestyle and medical variables for cases and matched controls. Results: The minimum prevalence of any VRIA was 17.6% and 8.1% in the eyes with and without visual impairment, respectively. VRIA were identified as the primary cause of visual impairment in 3.6% of eyes.

DESIGN: Models were identified through an update of a published systematic review and validated in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and the UK Biobank. The performance of the models to predict the occurrence of colorectal cancer within 5 or 10 years after study enrolment was assessed by discrimination (C-statistic) and calibration (plots of observed vs predicted probability). RESULTS: The systematic review and its update identified 16 models from 8 publications (8 colorectal, 5 colon and 3 rectal). The number of participants included in each model validation ranged from 41 587 to 396 515, and the number of cases ranged from 115 to 1781. Eligible and ineligible participants across the models were largely comparable. Calibration of the models, where assessable, was very good and further improved by recalibration. The C-statistics of the models were largely similar between validation cohorts with the highest values achieved being 0.70 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.72) in the UK Biobank and 0.71 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.74) in EPIC. CONCLUSION: Several of these non-invasive models exhibited good calibration and discrimination within both external validation populations and are therefore potentially suitable candidates for the facilitation of risk stratification in population-based colorectal screening programmes. Future work should both evaluate this potential, through modelling and impact studies, and ascertain if further enhancement in their performance can be obtained.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29615487","10.1136/gutjnl-2017-315730"

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a population approach with a polypill including a statin (simvastatin 20 mg) and three antihypertensive agents (amlodipine 2.5 mg, losartan 25 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) and periodic risk assessment with different risk thresholds. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model for lifetime predictions of CVD events, diabetes, and death in 259 146 asymptomatic UK Biobank participants aged 40-69 years. We assessed incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for polypill scenarios with the same combination of agents and doses but differing for starting age, and periodic risk assessment with 10-year CVD risk thresholds of 10% and 20%. RESULTS: Restrictive risk assessment, in which statins and antihypertensives were prescribed when risk exceeded 20%, was the optimal strategy gaining 123 QALYs (95% credible interval (CI) -173 to 387) per 10 000 individuals at an extra cost of pound1.45 million (95% CI 0.89 to 1.94) as compared with current practice. Although less restrictive risk assessment and polypill scenarios prevented more CVD events and attained larger survival gains, these benefits were offset by the additional costs and disutility of daily medication use. Lowering the risk threshold for prescription of statins to 10% was economically unattractive, costing pound40 000 per QALY gained. Starting the polypill from age 60 onwards became the most cost-effective scenario when annual drug prices were reduced below pound240. All polypill scenarios would save costs at prices below pound50. CONCLUSIONS: Periodic risk assessment using lower risk thresholds is unlikely to be cost-effective. The polypill would become cost-effective if drug prices were reduced.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077465","10.1136/heartjnl-2016-310529"

METHODS: The UK Biobank data were used to conduct two investigations: a cross-sectional study to estimate cardiometabolic risk and a prospective cohort study to estimate mortality risk. Binary regression analyses were used to model the association between coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, venous thromboembolism and peripheral artery disease diagnoses with seven inflammatory disorders (eg, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), systemic vasculitis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC)). Cox proportional hazards was used to estimate all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality. RESULTS: About 4% (n=19, 082) of the study population (n=5 02 641) were diagnosed with a chronic inflammatory disorder. The most common inflammatory disorder was psoriasis (n=6286), and the least common was SLE (n=654). SLE showed the strongest association with multiple (relative risk (RR) 6.36, 95% CI 4.37 to 9.25) risk of cardiometabolic diseases, followed by the RA (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.59 to 1.83), UC (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.51 to 1.89), AS (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.52), vasculitis (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.42-1.90) and psoriasis (RR 1.25, 95% 1.16 to 1.35) disorders. The magnitude of the association was higher among participants prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids drugs, with multiple cardiometabolic risk being greater within SLE (RR 12.35, 95% CI 7.18 to 21.24), followed by UC (RR 3.81, 95% CI 2.69 to 5.38), Crohn's disease (RR 3.07, 95% CI 1.85 to 5.11), RA (RR 3.06, 95% CI 2.44 to 3.85), psoriasis (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.95), AS (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.48 to 3.41) and vasculitis (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.79). Similar pattern was observed with respect to the cumulative cardiometabolic risk. CONCLUSION: Inflammatory disorders are associated with heightened risk of cardiometabolic events, which may vary by anti-inflammatory therapy and duration. All-cause mortality was also higher among specific inflammatory disorders compared with the absence of inflammatory disorders.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28601812","10.1136/heartjnl-2017-311214"

We assessed the relationship between reproductive factors and incident CVD in the UK Biobank. METHODS: Between 2006 and 2010, the UK Biobank recruited over 500 000 participants aged 40-69 years across the UK. During 7 years of follow-up, 9054 incident cases of CVD (34% women), 5782 cases of coronary heart disease (CHD) (28% women), and 3489 cases of stroke (43% women) were recorded among 267 440 women and 215 088 men without a history of CVD at baseline. Cox regression models yielded adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD, CHD and stroke associated with reproductive factors. RESULTS: Adjusted HRs (95% CI) for CVD were 1.10 (1.01 to 1.30) for early menarche (<12 years), 0.97 (0.96 to 0.98) for each year increase in age at first birth, 1.04 (1.00 to 1.09) for each miscarriage, 1.14 (1.02 to 1.28) for each stillbirth, and 1.33 (1.19 to 1.49) for early menopause (<47 years). Hysterectomy without oophorectomy or with previous oophorectomy had adjusted HRs of 1.16 (1.06 to 1.28) and 2.30 (1.20 to 4.43) for CVD. Each additional child was associated with a HR for CVD of 1.03 (1.00 to 1.06) in women and 1.03 (1.02 to 1.05) in men. CONCLUSIONS: Early menarche, early menopause, earlier age at first birth, and a history of miscarriage, stillbirth or hysterectomy were each independently associated with a higher risk of CVD in later life. The relationship between the number of children and incident CVD was similar for men and women.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29335253","10.1136/heartjnl-2017-312289"

METHODS: Adults (n=171 125) aged 40-70 years from the UK Biobank who were cardiovascular disease (CVD) free and who had their arterial stiffness assessed at the time of study recruitment between 2006 and 2010 were included. The main exposure was represented by a global measure of chronic inflammatory disorders. Two inflammatory biomarker measures (eg, leucocytes count, granulocytes count) were included as markers of inflammation severity. The arterial stiffness index assessed by a non-invasive technique represented the study primary outcome measure. RESULTS: A total of 5976 (3%) participants diagnosed with inflammatory disorders and 165 149 participants without an inflammatory disorder had data on arterial stiffness. Adjusted linear regression analyses revealed a 14% increment in mean arterial stiffness for chronic inflammatory disorders (beta coefficient (beta) 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.24, P=0.002) compared with no chronic inflammatory disorder. Arterial stiffness tended to increase (P value=0.031) with tertiles of leucocytes and granulocytes count. For instance, mean arterial stiffness values increased from 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29) in the first tertile to 1.17 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.34) in the second tertile, and 1.21 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.39) in the third tertile of leucocytes count. There was evidence for similar associations with some of the most common individual inflammatory disorders, including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. CONCLUSION: Arterial stiffness was associated with multiple chronic inflammatory disorders. An increasing trend in mean arterial stiffness was also documented with increasing tertiles of different inflammatory biomarkers. Future studies are needed to investigate the discriminant value of arterial stiffness to predict major CVD events within various inflammatory disorders.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29305563","10.1136/heartjnl-2017-312610"

METHODS: Participants were 479 054 individuals from the UK Biobank. The exposures were self-reported social isolation and loneliness. AMI, stroke and mortality were the outcomes. RESULTS: Over 7.1 years, 5731 had first AMI, and 3471 had first stroke.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study using data from 3 58 799 participants, aged 37-73 years, from UK Biobank. Commute and non-commute travel were assessed at baseline in 2006-2010. We classified participants according to whether they relied exclusively on the car or used alternative modes of transport that were more active at least some of the time. The main outcome measures were incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, and CVD, cancer and all-cause mortality. We excluded events in the first 2 years and conducted analyses separately for those who regularly commuted and those who did not. RESULTS: In maximally adjusted models, regular commuters with more active patterns of travel on the commute had a lower risk of incident (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.00) and fatal (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.95) CVD. Those regular commuters who also had more active patterns of non-commute travel had an even lower risk of fatal CVD (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.85). Among those who were not regular commuters, more active patterns of travel were associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: More active patterns of travel were associated with a reduced risk of incident and fatal CVD and all-cause mortality in adults.

This study examines the relationship with self-reported health (SRH) and happiness. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of the 163 066 UK Biobank participants who completed the happiness rating. The association between adiposity and SRH and happiness was examined using logistic regression. SRH was defined as good (excellent, good), or poor (fair, poor). Self-reported happiness was defined as happy (extremely, very, moderately) or unhappy (moderately, very, extremely). RESULTS: Poor health was reported by 44 457 (27.3%) participants. The adjusted ORs for poor health were 3.86, 2.92, 2.60 and 6.41 for the highest, compared with lowest, deciles of Body Mass Index, waist circumference, waist to hip ratio and body fat percent, respectively. The associations were stronger in men (p<0.001). Overall, 7511 (4.6%) participants felt unhappy, and only class III obese participants were more likely to feel unhappy (adjusted OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.53, p<0.001) but the associations differed by sex (p<0.001). Among women, there was a significant association between unhappiness and all levels of obesity. By contrast, only class III obese men had significantly increased risk and overweight and class I obese men were less likely to be unhappy. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity impacts adversely on happiness as well as health, but the association with unhappiness disappeared after adjustment for self-reported health, indicating this may be mediated by health. Compared with obese men, obese women are less likely to report poor health, but more likely to feel unhappy.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24336235","10.1136/jech-2013-203077"

The personality trait of neuroticism, reflecting a relatively stable tendency towards negative emotions, has also been associated with elevated rates of death in some studies. Accordingly, we tested the possibility that it is the neuroticism trait itself, rather than the distress state, that is generating an increased risk of mortality. METHODS: We used data from the UK Biobank study, a UK-wide prospective cohort study (2006-2010) in which distress was ascertained using the Patient Health Questionnaire and neuroticism using the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised Short Form. RESULTS: A mean of 6.2 years of follow-up of 308 721 study members gave rise to 4334 deaths. Higher neuroticism was weakly associated with total mortality (age-adjusted and sex-adjusted HR per SD increase; 95% CI 1.05; 1.02 to 1.09), and moderately strongly correlated with distress symptoms (r=0.55, p<0.0001). Distress symptoms were positively related to risk of total mortality (age-adjusted and sex-adjusted HR per SD increase in distress; 95% CI 1.23; 1.20 to 1.26). This gradient was, in fact, slightly strengthened after adding neuroticism to the multivariable model (1.30; 1.26 to 1.34) but markedly attenuated after taking into account other covariates which included health behaviours and somatic disease (1.16; 1.12 to 1.20). Similar results were apparent when cardiovascular disease, cancer and external cause of death were the end points of interest. CONCLUSIONS: While there was good a priori reasons to anticipate the neuroticism would at least partially explain the relation between distress symptoms and cause-specific mortality, we found no such evidence in the present study.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27520533","10.1136/jech-2016-207267"

The additional ability of MRI to also measure muscle volumes, muscle AT infiltration and ectopic fat, in combination with rapid scanning protocols and efficient image analysis tools, makes quantitative MRI a powerful tool for advanced body composition assessment.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29581385","10.1136/jim-2018-000722"

In this study, we applied a multitrait GWAS approach to discover additional factor of the missing heritability of human anthropometric variation. METHODS: We analysed 205 traits, including diseases identified at baseline in the GCAT cohort (Genomes For Life- Cohort study of the Genomes of Catalonia) (n=4988), a Mediterranean adult population-based cohort study from the south of Europe. We estimated SNP heritability contribution and single-trait GWAS for all traits from 15 million SNP variants. Then, we applied a multitrait-related approach to study genome-wide association to anthropometric measures in a two-stage meta-analysis with the UK Biobank cohort (n=336 107). RESULTS: Heritability estimates (eg, skin colour, alcohol consumption, smoking habit, body mass index, educational level or height) revealed an important contribution of SNP variants, ranging from 18% to 77%. Single-trait analysis identified 1785 SNPs with genome-wide significance threshold. From these, several previously reported single-trait hits were confirmed in our sample with LINC01432 (p=1.9x10(-9)) variants associated with male baldness, LDLR variants with hyperlipidaemia (ICD-9:272) (p=9.4x10(-10)) and variants in IRF4 (p=2.8x10(-57)), SLC45A2 (p=2.2x10(-130)), HERC2 (p=2.8x10(-176)), OCA2 (p=2.4x10(-121)) and MC1R (p=7.7x10(-22)) associated with hair, eye and skin colour, freckling, tanning capacity and sun burning sensitivity and the Fitzpatrick phototype score, all highly correlated cross-phenotypes.

The UK Biobank allows us to study the medical consequences of CNVs in middle and old age in half a million well-phenotyped adults. METHODS: We analysed all Biobank participants for the presence of 54 CNVs associated with genomic disorders or clinical phenotypes, including their reciprocal deletions or duplications. After array quality control and exclusion of first-degree relatives, we compared 381 452 participants of white British or Irish origin who carried no CNVs with carriers of each of the 54 CNVs (ranging from 5 to 2843 persons). We used logistic regression analysis to estimate the risk of developing 58 common medical phenotypes (3132 comparisons). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Many of the CNVs have profound effects on medical health and mortality, even in people who have largely escaped early neurodevelopmental outcomes. Forty-six CNV-phenotype associations were significant at a false discovery rate threshold of 0.1, all in the direction of increased risk. Known medical consequences of CNVs were confirmed, but most identified associations are novel. Deletions at 16p11.2 and 16p12.1 had the largest numbers of significantly associated phenotypes (seven each).

Exposure to occupational hazards is an important preventable risk factor but the contribution of specific occupations to COPD risk in a general population is uncertain. Our aim was to investigate the association of COPD with occupation in the UK population. METHODS: In 2006-2010, the UK Biobank cohort recruited 502 649 adults aged 40-69 years. COPD cases were identified by prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity<lower limit of normal according to American Thoracic Society (ATS)/ European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines. Current occupations were coded using the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) 2000. Prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% CIs of COPD for each SOC-coded job were estimated using a robust Poisson model adjusted for sex, age, recruitment centre and lifetime tobacco smoking. Analyses restricted to never-smokers and non-asthmatics were also performed. RESULTS: Of the 353 occupations reported by 228 614 current working participants, several showed significantly increased COPD risk. Those at highest COPD risk were seafarers (PR=2.64; 95% CI 1.59 to 4.38), coal mine operatives (PR=2.30; 95% CI 1.00 to 5.31), cleaners (industrial: PR=1.96; 95% CI 1.16 to 3.31 and domestic: PR=1.43; 95% CI 1.28 to 1.59), roofers/tilers (PR=1.86; 95% CI 1.29 to 2.67), packers/bottlers/canners/fillers (PR=1.60; 95% CI 1.15 to 2.22), horticultural trades (PR=1.55; 95% CI 0.97 to 2.50), food/drink/tobacco process operatives (PR=1.46; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.93), floorers/wall tilers (PR=1.41; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.00), chemical/related process operatives (PR=1.39; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.97), postal workers/couriers (PR=1.35; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.59), labourers in building/woodworking trades (PR=1.32; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.68), school mid-day assistants (PR=1.32; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.74) and kitchen/catering assistants (PR=1.30; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.53). Associations were similar in analyses restricted to never-smokers and non-asthmatics. CONCLUSIONS: Selected occupations are associated with increased COPD risk in a large cross-sectional population-based UK study.

METHODS: We undertook a cross-sectional study using baseline data from the unique UK Biobank resource (n=502 649). RA was based on self-report, and type of medication was used as a proxy measure of valid diagnosis. Participants with and without RA were compared in terms of sociodemographic, lifestyle and other disease-related risk factors. Logistic regression models were used to determine whether participants with RA were more likely to report comorbid conditions, and whether this varied by RA severity. The models were adjusted for potential confounders and lifestyle risk factors. RESULTS: At baseline, 5657 (1.13%) eligible UK Biobank participants reported RA of whom 2849 (0.57%) had medically treated RA (median duration=10 years). Prevalence was significantly higher among female, South Asian and socioeconomically deprived participants. Participants with RA were significantly more likely to report diabetes (covariate-adjusted OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.32, p<0.01), hypertension (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.27, p<0.001) and cardiovascular disease (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.67, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: UK Biobank provides extensive data concerning RA population-level comorbidity and risk factors. The frequency, distribution and characteristics of participants reporting RA in UK Biobank are largely consistent with other studies. It provides a unique opportunity to interrogate biomarkers, genetic data, detailed imaging and linkage to clinical records at the population level across primary and secondary care.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27403335","10.1136/rmdopen-2016-000267"

OBJECTIVE: To determine rare and potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of COPD and severity of airflow limitation. METHODS: 3226 current or former smokers of European ancestry with lung function measures indicative of Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2 COPD or worse were genotyped using an exome array. An analysis of risk of COPD was carried out using ever smoking controls (n=4784). Associations with %predicted FEV1 were tested in cases. We followed-up signals of interest (p<10(-5)) in independent samples from a subset of the UK Biobank population and also undertook a more powerful discovery study by meta-analysing the exome array data and UK Biobank data for variants represented on both arrays. RESULTS: Among the associated variants were two in regions previously unreported for COPD; a low frequency non-synonymous SNP in MOCS3 (rs7269297, pdiscovery=3.08x10(-6), preplication=0.019) and a rare SNP in IFIT3, which emerged in the meta-analysis (rs140549288, pmeta=8.56x10(-6)). In the meta-analysis of % predicted FEV1 in cases, the strongest association was shown for a splice variant in a previously unreported region, SERPINA12 (rs140198372, pmeta=5.72x10(-6)). We also confirmed previously reported associations with COPD risk at MMP12, HHIP, GPR126 and CHRNA5. No associations in novel regions reached a stringent exome-wide significance threshold (p<3.7x10(-7)). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several associations with the risk of COPD and severity of airflow limitation, including novel regions MOCS3, IFIT3 and SERPINA12, which warrant further study.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26917578","10.1136/thoraxjnl-2015-207876"

The frequency of mLOY increases with age and may reflect poor genomic maintenance as well as clonal imbalances in normal immune function, making mLOY an attractive candidate marker for cancer risk. Here, we investigated the relationship between mLOY and incident cancer in a large sample of 207,603 cancer-free men from the UK Biobank, in which 13,895 men developed an incident solid tumor during follow-up. We identified mLOY by scanning for deviations in genotyping array log R intensity ratios across the male-specific chromosome Y region. Overall, we detected low proportions of cells with mLOY in 3,358 (1.6%) men and high proportions of mLOY in 524 (0.3%) men. We found an association of mLOY with overall solid tumor incidence using both low and high mLOY thresholds [HRlow = 1.18; 95% confidence interval (CI) low, 1.07-1.30; P-low = 0.001; HRhigh = 1.36; 95% CIhigh, 1.09-1.71; P-high = 0.007] and more specifically we observed an association with lung cancer (HRhigh = 2.25; 95% CIhigh, 1.36-3.71; P-high = 0.002). Stronger associations were observed without adjustment for smoking, suggesting that smoking is an important confounder of tumor incidence. It is unlikely that mLOY is a major mediator of the effect of cigarette smoking on cancer risk, as mLOY was observed in only a small fraction of smokers who developed cancer. In summary, mLOY was modestly associated with incidence of solid tumors in the UK Biobank, although for some cancer subtypes these findings may reflect residual confounding by smoking.///Significance: Evidence from the UK Biobank indicates mosaic chromosome Y loss in leukocytes is moderately associated with increased incidence of select solid tumors.","<Go to ISI>://WOS:000457394600007","10.1158/0008-5472.Can-18-2566"

Models aimed at predicting future disease risk that contains lifestyle factors may be of particular use for targeting health promotion activities at an individual level. This type of cancer risk prediction is not yet available in the UK. We have adopted the approach used by the well-established U.S.-derived ""YourCancerRisk"" model for use in the UK population, which allow users to quantify their individual risk of developing individual cancers relative to the population average risk. The UK version of ""YourCancerRisk"" computes 10-year cancer risk estimates for 11 cancers utilizing UK figures for prevalence of risk factors and cancer incidence. Because the prevalence of risk factors and the incidence rates for cancer are different between the U.S. and the UK population, this UK model provides more accurate estimates of risks for a UK population. Using an example of breast cancer and data from UK Biobank cohort, we demonstrate that the individual risk factor estimates are similar for the U.S. and UK populations. Assessment of the performance and validation of the multivariate model predictions based on a binary score confirm the model's applicability. The model can be used to estimate absolute and relative cancer risk for use in Primary Care and community settings and is being used in the community to guide lifestyle change.

We aimed to investigate whether specific leukocyte subpopulations, which may more closely indicate a specific inflammatory pathway, are specifically associated with CVD. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Participants (478 259) from UK Biobank with data for white blood cell count were included. Death because of CVD (n=1377) and non-CVD causes (n=8987) occurred during median follow-up time of 7.0 years (interquartile range, 6.3-7.6). In Cox models, deciles of leukocyte counts (lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) were examined using the fifth decile as the referent group. Models were stratified by sex and adjusted for a range of classical risk factors. A sensitivity analysis excluded participants with baseline comorbidites and the first 2 years of follow-up. Men (hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-2.08) and women (HR, 2.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-3.35) in the highest decile of neutrophil count were at higher risk of CVD mortality and nonfatal CVD (men HR, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.42 and women HR, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.38). In the sensitivity analysis, the power to investigate CVD mortality was limited, but for both sexes combined, the linear HRs for a 1x10(9)/L cell count increase in white blood cell count and neutrophils, respectively, was 1.05 (1.03-1.07) and 1.07 (1.04-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: Among circulating leukocyte subpopulations, neutrophil count in men was most consistently associated with fatal and nonfatal CVD.

We hypothesized that some individuals with EOCAD carry a high number of common genetic risk variants, with a combined effect similar to Mendelian forms of coronary artery disease, such as familial hypercholesterolemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: To confirm the polygenic contribution to EOCAD (age of </=40 years for men and </=45 years for women), we calculated in 111 418 British participants from the UK Biobank cohort a genetic risk score (GRS) based on the presence of 182 independent variants associated with coronary artery disease (GRS182). Participants with a diagnosis of EOCAD who underwent a revascularization procedure (n=96) had a significantly higher GRS182 (P=3.21x10(-9)) than those without EOCAD. An increase of 1 SD in GRS182 corresponded to an odds ratio of 1.84 (1.52-2.24) for EOCAD. The prevalence of a polygenic contribution that increased EOCAD risk similar to what is observed in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia was estimated at 1 in 53. In a local cohort of individuals with EOCAD (n=30), GRS182 was significantly increased compared with UK Biobank controls (P=0.001). Seven participants (23%) had a GRS182 corresponding to an estimated 2-fold increase in EOCAD risk; none had a rare mutation involved in monogenic dyslipidemia or EOCAD. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a significant polygenic contribution in individuals presenting with EOCAD, which could be more prevalent than familial hypercholesterolemia.

The Barker hypothesis posits that intrauterine growth restriction resulting in lower birthweight is causal for these diseases, but causality is difficult to infer from observational studies. METHODS: We performed regression analyses to assess associations of birthweight with cardiovascular disease and T2D in 237 631 individuals from the UK Biobank. Further, we assessed the causal relationship of such associations using Mendelian randomization. RESULTS: In the observational analyses, birthweight showed inverse associations with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (beta, -0.83 and -0.26; per raw unit in outcomes and SD change in birthweight; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.90 to -0.75 and -0.31 to -0.22, respectively), T2D (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.79-0.87), lipid-lowering treatment (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.86), and coronary artery disease (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.94), whereas the associations with adult body mass index and body fat (beta, 0.04 and 0.02; per SD change in outcomes and birthweight; 95% CI, 0.03-0.04 and 0.01-0.02, respectively) were positive. The Mendelian randomization analyses indicated inverse causal associations of birthweight with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 2-hour glucose, coronary artery disease, and T2D and positive causal association with body mass index but no associations with blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that lower birthweight, used as a proxy for intrauterine growth retardation, is causally related with increased susceptibility to coronary artery disease and T2D.

Although short-term clinical trial results have not demonstrated major adverse effects, long-term data will not be available for some time. Genetic studies in large biobanks offer a unique opportunity to predict drug effects and provide context for the evaluation of future clinical trial outcomes. METHODS: We tested the association of the PCSK9 missense variant rs11591147 with predefined phenotypes and phenome-wide, in 337 536 individuals of British ancestry in the UK Biobank, with independent discovery and replication. Using a Bayesian statistical method, we leveraged phenotype correlations to evaluate the phenome-wide impact of PCSK9 inhibition with higher power at a finer resolution. RESULTS: The T allele of rs11591147 showed a protective effect on hyperlipidemia (odds ratio, 0.63+/-0.04; P=2.32x10(-38)), coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 0.73+/-0.09; P=1.05x10(-6)), and ischemic stroke (odds ratio, 0.61+/-0.18; P=2.40x10(-3)) and was associated with increased type 2 diabetes mellitus risk adjusted for lipid-lowering medication status (odds ratio, 1.24+/-0.10; P=1.98x10(-7)). We did not observe associations with cataracts, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and cognitive dysfunction. Leveraging phenotype correlations, we observed evidence of a protective association with cerebral infarction and vascular occlusion. These results explore the effects of direct PCSK9 inhibition; off-target effects cannot be predicted using this approach. CONCLUSIONS: This result represents the first genetic evidence in a large cohort for the protective effect of PCSK9 inhibition on ischemic stroke and corroborates exploratory evidence from clinical trials.

Our earlier studies identified and validated 56 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with BP from meta-analyses of exome chip genotype data. An additional 100 variants yielded suggestive evidence of association. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we augment the sample with 140 886 European individuals from the UK Biobank, in whom 77 of the 100 suggestive SNVs were available for association analysis with systolic BP or diastolic BP or pulse pressure. We performed 2 meta-analyses, one in individuals of European, South Asian, African, and Hispanic descent (pan-ancestry, approximately 475 000), and the other in the subset of individuals of European descent ( approximately 423 000). Twenty-one SNVs were genome-wide significant (P<5x10(-)(8)) for BP, of which 4 are new BP loci: rs9678851 (missense, SLC4A1AP), rs7437940 (AFAP1), rs13303 (missense, STAB1), and rs1055144 (7p15.2). In addition, we identified a potentially independent novel BP-associated SNV, rs3416322 (missense, SYNPO2L) at a known locus, uncorrelated with the previously reported SNVs. Two SNVs are associated with expression levels of nearby genes, and SNVs at 3 loci are associated with other traits. One SNV with a minor allele frequency <0.01, (rs3025380 at DBH) was genome-wide significant. CONCLUSIONS: We report 4 novel loci associated with BP regulation, and 1 independent variant at an established BP locus. This analysis highlights several candidate genes with variation that alter protein function or gene expression for potential follow-up.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030403","10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.117.001778"

METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the contribution of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism variation to AF risk (single-nucleotide polymorphism heritability, h(2)g ) using data from 120 286 unrelated individuals of European ancestry (2987 with AF) in the population-based UK Biobank. We ascertained AF based on self-report, medical record billing codes, procedure codes, and death records. We estimated h(2)g using a variance components method with variants having a minor allele frequency >/=1%. We evaluated h(2)g in age, sex, and genomic strata of interest. The h(2)g for AF was 22.1% (95% confidence interval, 15.6%-28.5%) and was similar for early- versus older-onset AF (</=65 versus >65 years of age), as well as for men and women. The proportion of AF variance explained by genetic variation was mainly accounted for by common (minor allele frequency, >/=5%) variants (20.4%; 95% confidence interval, 15.1%-25.6%). Only 6.4% (95% confidence interval, 5.1%-7.7%) of AF variance was attributed to variation within known AF susceptibility, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy gene regions. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation contributes substantially to AF risk. The risk for AF conferred by genomic variation is similar to that observed for several other cardiovascular diseases. Established AF loci only explain a moderate proportion of disease risk, suggesting that further genetic discovery, with an emphasis on common variation, is warranted to understand the causal genetic basis of AF.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29237688","10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.117.001838"

Ninety-seven genetic risk loci have been identified to date, but the identification of additional susceptibility loci might be important to enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of CAD. OBJECTIVE: To expand the number of genome-wide significant loci, catalog functional insights, and enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of CAD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a genome-wide association study in 34 541 CAD cases and 261 984 controls of UK Biobank resource followed by replication in 88 192 cases and 162 544 controls from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D. We identified 75 loci that replicated and were genome-wide significant (P<5x10(-8)) in meta-analysis, 13 of which had not been reported previously. Next, to further identify novel loci, we identified all promising (P<0.0001) loci in the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D data and performed reciprocal replication and meta-analyses with UK Biobank. This led to the identification of 21 additional novel loci reaching genome-wide significance (P<5x10(-8)) in meta-analysis. Finally, we performed a genome-wide meta-analysis of all available data revealing 30 additional novel loci (P<5x10(-8)) without further replication. The increase in sample size by UK Biobank raised the number of reconstituted gene sets from 4.2% to 13.9% of all gene sets to be involved in CAD. For the 64 novel loci, 155 candidate causal genes were prioritized, many without an obvious connection to CAD. Fine mapping of the 161 CAD loci generated lists of credible sets of single causal variants and genes for functional follow-up. Genetic risk variants of CAD were linked to development of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and death. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 64 novel genetic risk loci for CAD and performed fine mapping of all 161 risk loci to obtain a credible set of causal variants. The large expansion of reconstituted gene sets argues in favor of an expanded omnigenic model view on the genetic architecture of CAD.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29212778","10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312086"

Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular diseases, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy. METHODS: We analyzed the association of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [NOS3] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [GUCY1A3]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in NOS3 and rs7692387 in GUCY1A3) known to associate with increased NOS3 and GUCY1A3 expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a genetic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other diseases. We also examined whether rare loss-of-function mutations in NOS3 and GUCY1A3 were associated with coronary heart disease using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (n=27 815). RESULTS: A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; P=5.5*10(-26)], peripheral arterial disease (odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; P=0.0005), and stroke (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; P=0.0006). In a mediation analysis, the effect of the genetic score on decreased coronary heart disease risk extended beyond its effect on blood pressure. Conversely, rare variants that inactivate the NOS3 or GUCY1A3 genes were associated with a 23 mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (95% CI, 12-34; P=5.6*10(-5)) and a 3-fold higher risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.29-7.12; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling is associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke.

Both heritable and lifestyle risk factors contribute to elevated BP levels. We aimed to investigate the extent to which lifestyle factors could offset the effect of an adverse BP genetic profile and its effect on CVD risk. METHODS: We constructed a genetic risk score for high BP by using 314 published BP loci in 277 005 individuals without previous CVD from the UK Biobank study, a prospective cohort of individuals aged 40 to 69 years, with a median of 6.11 years of follow-up. We scored participants according to their lifestyle factors including body mass index, healthy diet, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol consumption, smoking, and urinary sodium excretion levels measured at recruitment. We examined the association between tertiles of genetic risk and tertiles of lifestyle score with BP levels and incident CVD by using linear regression and Cox regression models, respectively. RESULTS: Healthy lifestyle score was strongly associated with BP (P<10(-320)) for systolic and diastolic BP and CVD events regardless of the underlying BP genetic risk. Participants with a favorable in comparison with an unfavorable lifestyle (bottom versus top tertile lifestyle score) had 3.6, 3.5, and 3.6 mm Hg lower systolic BP in low, middle, and high genetic risk groups, respectively (P for interaction=0.0006). Similarly, favorable in comparison with unfavorable lifestyle showed 30%, 31%, and 33% lower risk of CVD among participants in low, middle, and high genetic risk groups, respectively (P for interaction=0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Our data further support population-wide efforts to lower BP in the population via lifestyle modification.

Then we further examined these associations in individuals with different genetic burden by stratifying individuals based on their genetic risk scores for coronary heart disease and atrial fibrillation. We compared disease risk among individuals in different tertiles of fitness, physical activity, and genetic risk using lowest tertiles as reference. RESULTS: Grip strength, physical activity, and cardiorespiratory fitness showed inverse associations with incident cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease: hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.81; HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.97; and HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.63-0.74, per SD change, respectively; atrial fibrillation: HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.73-0.76; HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91-0.95; and HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.56-0.65, per SD change, respectively). Higher grip strength and cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with lower risk of incident coronary heart disease and atrial fibrillation in each genetic risk score group (Ptrend <0.001 in each genetic risk category). In particular, high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with 49% lower risk for coronary heart disease (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38-0.69) and 60% lower risk for atrial fibrillation (HR, 0.40; 95%, CI 0.30-0.55) among individuals at high genetic risk for these diseases.

Little is known about the influence of air pollutants on cardiac structure and function. We aim to investigate the relationship between chronic past exposure to traffic-related pollutants and the cardiac chamber volume, ejection fraction, and left ventricular remodeling patterns after accounting for potential confounders. Methods: Exposure to ambient air pollutants including particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide was estimated from the Land Use Regression models for the years between 2005 and 2010. Cardiac parameters were measured from cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging studies of 3920 individuals free from pre-existing cardiovascular disease in the UK Biobank population study. The median (interquartile range) duration between the year of exposure estimate and the imaging visit was 5.2 (0.6) years. We fitted multivariable linear regression models to investigate the relationship between cardiac parameters and traffic-related pollutants after adjusting for various confounders. Results: The studied cohort was 62+/-7 years old, and 46% were men. In fully adjusted models, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mum concentration was significantly associated with larger left ventricular end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume (effect size = 0.82%, 95% CI, 0.09-1.55%, P=0.027; and effect size = 1.28%, 95% CI, 0.15-2.43%, P=0.027, respectively, per interquartile range increment in particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mum) and right ventricular end-diastolic volume (effect size = 0.85%, 95% CI, 0.12-1.58%, P=0.023, per interquartile range increment in particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mum). Likewise, higher nitrogen dioxide concentration was associated with larger biventricular volume. Distance from the major roads was the only metric associated with lower left ventricular mass (effect size = -0.74%, 95% CI, -1.3% to -0.18%, P=0.01, per interquartile range increment). Neither left and right atrial phenotypes nor left ventricular geometric remodeling patterns were influenced by the ambient pollutants. Conclusions: In a large asymptomatic population with no prevalent cardiovascular disease, higher past exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mum and nitrogen dioxide was associated with cardiac ventricular dilatation, a marker of adverse remodeling that often precedes heart failure development.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524134","10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034856"

Although it is believed that varicose vein pathogenesis is multifactorial, there is limited understanding of the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to their formation. Large-scale studies of risk factors for varicose veins may highlight important aspects of pathophysiology and identify groups at increased risk for disease. METHODS: We applied machine learning to agnostically search for risk factors of varicose veins in 493 519 individuals in the UK Biobank. Predictors were further studied with univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses (2441 incident events). A genome-wide association study of varicose veins was also performed among 337 536 unrelated individuals (9577 cases) of white British descent, followed by expression quantitative loci and pathway analyses. Because height emerged as a new candidate risk factor, we performed mendelian randomization analyses to assess a potential causal role for height in varicose vein development. RESULTS: Machine learning confirmed several known (age, sex, obesity, pregnancy, history of deep vein thrombosis) and identified several new risk factors for varicose vein disease, including height. After adjustment for traditional risk factors in Cox regression, greater height remained independently associated with varicose veins (hazard ratio for upper versus lower quartile, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.51-2.01; P<0.0001). A genome-wide association study identified 30 new genome-wide significant loci, identifying pathways involved in vascular development and skeletal/limb biology. Mendelian randomization analysis provided evidence that increased height is causally related to varicose veins (inverse-variance weighted: odds ratio, 1.26; P=2.07x10(-16)). CONCLUSIONS: Using data from nearly a half-million individuals, we present a comprehensive genetic and epidemiological study of varicose veins. We identified novel clinical and genetic risk factors that provide pathophysiological insights and could help future improvements of treatment of varicose vein disease.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30566020","10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035584"

We therefore examined genetic associations with HF in a large national biobank, and assessed whether refined phenotypic classification would facilitate genetic discovery. METHODS: We defined all-cause HF among 488010 participants from the UK Biobank and performed a genome-wide association analysis. We refined the HF phenotype by classifying individuals with left ventricular dysfunction and without coronary artery disease as having nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM), and repeated a genetic association analysis. We then pursued replication of lead HF and NICM variants in independent cohorts, and performed adjusted association analyses to assess whether identified genetic associations were mediated through clinical HF risk factors. In addition, we tested rare, loss-of-function mutations in 24 known dilated cardiomyopathy genes for association with HF and NICM. Finally, we examined associations between lead variants and left ventricular structure and function among individuals without HF using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (n=4158) and echocardiographic data (n=30201). RESULTS: We identified 7382 participants with all-cause HF in the UK Biobank. Genome-wide association analysis of all-cause HF identified several suggestive loci ( P<1x10(-6)), the majority linked to upstream HF risk factors, ie, coronary artery disease ( CDKN2B-AS1 and MAP3K7CL) and atrial fibrillation ( PITX2). Refining the HF phenotype yielded a subset of 2038 NICM cases. In contrast to all-cause HF, genetic analysis of NICM revealed suggestive loci that have been implicated in dilated cardiomyopathy ( BAG3, CLCNKA-ZBTB17). Dilated cardiomyopathy signals arising from our NICM analysis replicated in independent cohorts, persisted after HF risk factor adjustment, and were associated with indices of left ventricular dysfunction in individuals without clinical HF. In addition, analyses of loss-of-function variants implicated BAG3 as a disease susceptibility gene for NICM (loss-offunction variant carrier frequency=0.01%; odds ratio,12.03; P=3.62x10(-5)). CONCLUSIONS: We found several distinct genetic mechanisms of all-cause HF in a national biobank that reflect well-known HF risk factors. Phenotypic refinement to a NICM subtype appeared to facilitate the discovery of genetic signals that act independently of clinical HF risk factors and that are associated with subclinical left ventricular dysfunction.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586722","10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.035774"

Observational studies have shown associations of their circulating levels with stroke. Our objective was to explore whether genetically determined circulating levels of cytokines and growth factors are associated with stroke and its etiologic subtypes by conducting a 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. METHODS: Genetic instruments for 41 cytokines and growth factors were obtained from a genome-wide association study of 8293 healthy adults. Their associations with stroke and stroke subtypes were evaluated in the MEGASTROKE genome-wide association study data set (67 162 cases; 454 450 controls) applying inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis, weighted-median analysis, Mendelian randomization-Egger regression, and multivariable Mendelian randomization. The UK Biobank cohort was used as an independent validation sample (4985 cases; 364 434 controls). Genetic instruments for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) were further tested for association with etiologically related vascular traits by using publicly available genome-wide association study data. RESULTS: Genetic predisposition to higher MCP-1 levels was associated with higher risk of any stroke (odds ratio [OR] per 1 SD increase, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09; P=0.0009), any ischemic stroke (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; P=0.002), large-artery stroke (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09-1.30; P=0.0002), and cardioembolic stroke (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06-1.23; P=0.0004), but not with small-vessel stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage.

A meta-analysis of observational studies showed higher circulating MCP-1 levels in patients with stroke in comparison with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic predisposition to elevated circulating levels of MCP-1 is associated with higher risk of stroke, in particular with large-artery stroke and cardioembolic stroke.

During a median mortality follow-up of 6.1 years (interquartile range 5.8-6.3), 3678 participants died, of which 1180 of CVD. Higher ASI was associated with increased risk of overall CVD (unadjusted hazard ratio 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-1.28), myocardial infarction (1.38; 95% CI, 1.32-1.44), coronary heart disease (1.31; 95% CI, 1.27-1.34), and heart failure (1.31; 95% CI 1.24-1.37). ASI also predicted mortality (all-cause, CVD, other). Higher PP was associated with overall CVD (1.57; 95% CI, 1.55-1.59), myocardial infarction (1.48; 95% CI, 1.42-1.54), coronary heart disease (1.47; 95% CI, 1.43-1.50), heart failure (1.47; 95% CI, 1.40-1.55), and CVD mortality (1.47; 95% CI, 1.40-1.55). PP improved risk reclassification of CVD in a non-laboratory-based Framingham Risk Score by 5.4%, ASI by 2.3%. CONCLUSIONS: ASI and PP are independent predictors of CVD and mortality outcomes. Although both improved risk prediction for new-onset disease, PP appears to have a larger clinical value than ASI.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29358193","10.1161/JAHA.117.007621"

However, HRR at earlier time intervals after cessation has not been well evaluated and might better reflect PNS reactivation. We hypothesize that early HRR indices within the first minute is better associated with all-cause and coronary artery disease mortality compared with HRR at 1 minute. METHODS AND RESULTS: The prognostic value of HRR at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 seconds after cessation of exercise was investigated in 40 727 selected UK Biobank participants (mean age 56 years, 45% male) free from cardiovascular disease. During a median follow-up period of 6 years, 536 participants died (including 39 of coronary artery disease). In multivariable analyses, including adjustments for aerobic exercise capacity, cardiovascular risk factors, and factors associated with mortality in general, only HRR at 10 seconds remained predictive of both all-cause and coronary artery disease mortality. Effects of HRR were larger and more significant when measured early after exercise cessation. Moreover, the association of change in heart rate between 10 seconds and 1 minute after exercise cessation with mortality was dependent on HRR at 10 seconds. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that decreased HRR at 10 seconds after cessation of exercise is a superior predictor of outcome compared with HRR at later time intervals. This observation might have important implications for the future reporting and interpretation of exercise tests.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29622586","10.1161/JAHA.117.008341"

We assessed the sex-specific relationships and their differences between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2010, the UK Biobank recruited over 500 000 participants aged 40 to 69 years across the United Kingdom. During 7 years of follow-up, 5710 cases of MI (28% women) were recorded among 265 988 women and 213 622 men without a history of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Cox regression models yielded adjusted hazard ratios for MI associated with body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio. There was an approximate log-linear relationship between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of MI in both sexes. A 1-SD higher in body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio, respectively, were associated with hazard ratios (confidence intervals) for MI of 1.22 (1.17; 1.28), 1.35 (1.28; 1.42), 1.49 (1.39; 1.59), and 1.34 (1.27; 1.40) in women and of 1.28 (1.23; 1.32), 1.28 (1.23; 1.33), 1.36 (1.30; 1.43), and 1.33 (1.28; 1.38) in men.

CONCLUSIONS: Although general and central adiposity measures each have profound deleterious effects on the risk of MI in both sexes, a higher waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio conferred a greater excess risk of MI in women than in men. Waist-to-hip ratio was more strongly associated with the risk of MI than body mass index in both sexes, especially in women.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29490971","10.1161/JAHA.117.008507"

We aimed to establish new risk factors of heart failure, which potentially could enable early diagnosis and preemptive treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: We applied machine learning in the UK Biobank in an agnostic search of risk factors for heart failure in 500 451 individuals, excluding individuals with prior heart failure. Novel factors were then subjected to several in-depth analyses, including multivariable Cox models of incident heart failure, and assessment of discrimination and calibration. Machine learning confirmed many known and putative risk factors for heart failure and identified several novel candidates. Mean reticulocyte volume appeared as one novel factor and leg bioimpedance another, the latter appearing as the most important new marker. Leg bioimpedance was lower in those who developed heart failure during an up to 9.8-year follow-up. When adjusting for known heart failure risk factors, leg bioimpedance was inversely related to heart failure (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.60 [0.48-0.73] and 0.75 [0.59-0.94], in age- and sex-adjusted and fully adjusted models, respectively, comparing the upper versus lower quartile). A model including leg bioimpedance, age, sex, and self-reported history of myocardial infarction showed good discrimination for future heart failure hospitalization (Concordance index [C-index]=0.82) and good calibration. CONCLUSIONS: Leg bioimpedance is inversely associated with heart failure incidence in the general population. A simple model of exclusively noninvasive measures, combining leg bioimpedance with history of myocardial infarction, age, and sex provides accurate predictive capacity.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29959136","10.1161/JAHA.118.008970"

We aimed to examine the causal effect of T2D, fasting glucose levels, and higher insulin resistance on CSVD using Mendelian randomization. METHODS: Five CSVD phenotypes were studied; 2 were clinical outcomes associated with CSVD (lacunar stroke: n=2191/27 297 and intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH]: n=2254/8195 [deep and lobar ICH]), whereas 3 were radiological markers of CSVD (white matter hyperintensities: n=8429; fractional anisotropy [FA]: n=8357; and mean diffusivity: n=8357). We applied 2 complementary analyses to evaluate the association of T2D with CSVD. First, we used summarized data from genome-wide association study to calculate the effects of T2D-related variants on CSVD with inverse-variance weighted and weighted median approaches. Second, we performed a genetic risk score approach to test the effects of T2D-associated variants on white matter hyperintensities, FA, and mean diffusivity using individual-level data in UK Biobank. RESULTS: T2D was associated with higher risk of lacunar stroke (odds ratio [OR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.28; P=0.007) and lower mean FA (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.92; P=0.004) but not white matter hyperintensities volume (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.97-1.04; P=0.626), higher mean diffusivity (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.89-1.23; P=0.612), ICH (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.95-1.20; P=0.269), lobar ICH (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.89-1.28; P=0.466), or deep ICH (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.99-1.36; P=0.074). Weighted median and penalized median weighted analysis showed similar effect estimates of T2D on lacunar stroke and FA, but with wider CIs, meaning they were not significant. The genetic score on individual-level data was significantly associated with FA (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.89; P=0.008) after adjusting for potential confounders.

Genetic studies provide a way to obtain novel insights in the disease mechanism underlying cerebral small vessel disease. The aim was to identify common variants associated with microstructural integrity of the white matter and to elucidate the relationships of white matter structural integrity with stroke, major depressive disorder, and Alzheimer disease. METHODS: This genome-wide association analysis included 8448 individuals from UK Biobank-a population-based cohort study that recruited individuals from across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010, aged 40 to 69 years. Microstructural integrity was measured as fractional anisotropy- (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)-derived parameters on diffusion tensor images. White matter hyperintensity volumes (WMHV) were assessed on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. RESULTS: We identified 1 novel locus at genome-wide significance (VCAN [versican]: rs13164785; P=3.7x10(-18) for MD and rs67827860; P=1.3x10(-14) for FA). LD score regression showed a significant genome-wide correlation between FA, MD, and WMHV (FA-WMHV rG 0.39 [SE, 0.15]; MD-WMHV rG 0.56 [SE, 0.19]). In polygenic risk score analysis, FA, MD, and WMHV were significantly associated with lacunar stroke, MD with major depressive disorder, and WMHV with Alzheimer disease. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants within the VCAN gene may play a role in the mechanisms underlying microstructural integrity of the white matter in the brain measured as FA and MD. Mechanisms underlying white matter alterations are shared with cerebrovascular disease, and inherited differences in white matter microstructure impact on Alzheimer disease and major depressive disorder.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29752348","10.1161/STROKEAHA.118.020811"

OBJECTIVES: To examine sex differences in the risk of airflow obstruction (a COPD hallmark) in relation to smoking history. METHODS: We analyzed 149,075 women and 100,252 men taking part in the UK Biobank who had provided spirometry measurements and information on smoking. The association of airflow obstruction with smoking characteristics was assessed by sex using regression analysis. The shape of this relationship was examined using restricted cubic splines. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The association of airflow obstruction with smoking status was stronger in women (odds ratio for ex-smokers [ORex], 1.44; ORcurrent, 3.45) than in men (ORex, 1.25; ORcurrent, 3.06) (P for interaction = 5.6 x 10(-4)). In both sexes, the association of airflow obstruction with cigarettes per day, smoking duration, and pack-years did not follow a linear pattern, with the increase in risk at lower doses being steeper among women. For equal doses of exposure, sex differences were present in both ex-smokers and current smokers for cigarettes per day (P for interactionex = 6.0 x 10(-8); P for interactioncurrent = 1.1 x 10(-5)), smoking duration (P for interactionex = 7.9 x 10(-4); P for interactioncurrent = 0.004), and pack-years (P for interactionex = 6.6 x 10(-18); P for interactioncurrent = 1.3 x 10(-6)). Overall, those who started smoking before age 18 years were more likely to have airflow obstruction, but a sex difference in this association was not clear. For equal time since quitting, the reduction in risk among women seemed less marked than among men. CONCLUSIONS: Exposed to the same dose of smoking, women showed a higher risk of airflow obstruction than men. This could partly explain the increasingly smaller sex difference in the prevalence of COPD, especially in countries where smoking patterns have become similar between women and men.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28075609","10.1164/rccm.201608-1545OC"

Methods: Retinal fundus images used in this study were 45- and 30-degree field of view images from the UK Biobank and Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) clinical trials, respectively. Refractive error was measured by autorefraction in UK Biobank and subjective refraction in AREDS. We trained a deep learning algorithm to predict refractive error from a total of 226,870 images and validated it on 24,007 UK Biobank and 15,750 AREDS images. Our model used the ""attention"" method to identify features that are correlated with refractive error. Results: The resulting algorithm had a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.56 diopters (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55-0.56) for estimating spherical equivalent on the UK Biobank data set and 0.91 diopters (95% CI: 0.89-0.93) for the AREDS data set. The baseline expected MAE (obtained by simply predicting the mean of this population) was 1.81 diopters (95% CI: 1.79-1.84) for UK Biobank and 1.63 (95% CI: 1.60-1.67) for AREDS. Attention maps suggested that the foveal region was one of the most important areas used by the algorithm to make this prediction, though other regions also contribute to the prediction. Conclusions: To our knowledge, the ability to estimate refractive error with high accuracy from retinal fundus photos has not been previously known and demonstrates that deep learning can be applied to make novel predictions from medical images.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30025129","10.1167/iovs.18-23887"

Among several possible explanations for this, it has been postulated that individuals who carry risk alleles but are unaffected are at some reproductive advantage, offsetting the effects of negative selection among those who are affected. The authors sought to test this hypothesis, isolating the effects of risk alleles on fecundity from the effects that are contingent on expressing schizophrenia. METHODS: The burden of schizophrenia risk alleles, as indexed by a polygenic risk score (PRS), carried by 139,679 participants in the UK Biobank study who did not have schizophrenia was compared with the number of offspring of these individuals. RESULTS: Higher schizophrenia liability in study subjects without manifest disorder was weakly but significantly associated with having more children (B=0.006, 95% CI=0.002, 0.010). The relationship was dependent on sex, with a positive correlation between number of children and liability among females (B=0.011, 95% CI=0.006, 0.016), whereas among males, higher liability was associated with being childless (odds ratio=0.96, 95% CI=0.94, 0.98). The negative effect on number of children associated with schizophrenia itself was twofold to 15-fold greater than the positive effect associated with PRS in unaffected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a complex relationship between liability and fecundity is consistent with sexual selection. Although the overall pattern of a weak positive correlation with liability may contribute to the persistence of schizophrenia risk alleles, these results indicate that the negative selection acting on individuals affected by schizophrenia in the general population is larger than any advantage conferred by genetic loading in unaffected individuals.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30606050","10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.18020140"

Genome-wide association analyses were performed to identify genetic variants associated with a proxy measure of alcohol consumption and alcohol misuse and to explore the shared genetic basis between these measures and other substance use, psychiatric, and behavioral traits. METHOD:: This study used quantitative measures from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) from two population-based cohorts of European ancestry (UK Biobank [N=121,604] and 23andMe [N=20,328]) and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis. Two additional GWAS analyses were performed, a GWAS for AUDIT scores on items 1-3, which focus on consumption (AUDIT-C), and for scores on items 4-10, which focus on the problematic consequences of drinking (AUDIT-P). RESULTS:: The GWAS meta-analysis of AUDIT total score identified 10 associated risk loci. Novel associations localized to genes including JCAD and SLC39A13; this study also replicated previously identified signals in the genes ADH1B, ADH1C, KLB, and GCKR. The dimensions of AUDIT showed positive genetic correlations with alcohol consumption (rg=0.76-0.92) and DSM-IV alcohol dependence (rg=0.33-0.63). AUDIT-P and AUDIT-C scores showed significantly different patterns of association across a number of traits, including psychiatric disorders. AUDIT-P score was significantly positively genetically correlated with schizophrenia (rg=0.22), major depressive disorder (rg=0.26), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (rg=0.23), whereas AUDIT-C score was significantly negatively genetically correlated with major depressive disorder (rg=-0.24) and ADHD (rg=-0.10). This study also used the AUDIT data in the UK Biobank to identify thresholds for dichotomizing AUDIT total score that optimize genetic correlations with DSM-IV alcohol dependence. Coding individuals with AUDIT total scores </=4 as control subjects and those with scores >/=12 as case subjects produced a significant high genetic correlation with DSM-IV alcohol dependence (rg=0.82) while retaining most subjects. CONCLUSIONS:: AUDIT scores ascertained in population-based cohorts can be used to explore the genetic basis of both alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorders.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30336701","10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.18040369"

We conducted a preregistered study of the relationship between brain volume and cognitive performance using a new sample of adults from the United Kingdom that is about 70% larger than the combined samples of all previous investigations on this subject ( N = 13,608). Our analyses systematically controlled for sex, age, height, socioeconomic status, and population structure, and our analyses were free of publication bias. We found a robust association between total brain volume and fluid intelligence ( r = .19), which is consistent with previous findings in the literature after controlling for measurement quality of intelligence in our data.

These relationships were mainly driven by gray matter (rather than white matter or fluid volume), and effect sizes were similar for both sexes and across age groups.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30499747","10.1177/0956797618808470"

Design Cross-sectional studies of carotid artery atherosclerosis in 24,822 Chinese adults from the China Kadoorie Biobank and 2579 Europeans from the UK Biobank. Methods Mean intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries and presence of carotid artery plaque were examined in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. The carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) findings in Chinese (mean age 59 years) were compared with a European population (mean age 62 years). Results Overall, the mean cIMT in Chinese was 0.70 mm (SD 0.16) and increased with age by 0.08 mm (SE 0.008) per 10-years older age. About 31% of the Chinese had carotid plaques and the prevalence varied 10-fold with age (6% at 40-49 to 63% at 70-89 years) and four-fold by region (range, 14%-57%). After adjustment for age, sex and region, plaque prevalence was higher in smokers than in non-smokers (36% vs. 28%) and two-fold higher in individuals with systolic blood pressure >/=160 mmHg than those with systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg (44% vs. 22%) in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. Mean cIMT was similar in the younger Chinese and European adults, but increased more steeply with age in the Chinese ( p = 0.002). Conclusions About one-third of Chinese adults had carotid plaques. The rate of progression of carotid atherosclerosis with age was more extreme in the Chinese compared with the European population, highlighting the need for more intensive strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention in China.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28128654","10.1177/2047487317689973"

It has been suggested that these studies may provide biased estimates of prevalence but are likely to provide valid estimates of association. We test these hypotheses using data collected on pain in a large Biobank study in the United Kingdom. METHODS: UK Biobank recruited 503,325 persons aged 40-69 years (participation rate 5.5%). Participants completed questionnaires, including pain, lifestyle and environment factors. As a comparison, we used both a large population study of pain (MUSICIAN: n = 8847, aged: 40-69 years) conducted 2008-2009 and the National Child Development study (NCDS) which recruited all persons in Great Britain born during one week of 1958 and followed them up at age 44 years (n = 9377). RESULTS: 'Any pain' (UK Biobank 61.0%; MUSICIAN 63.9%), chronic pain (42.9%, 52.2%) and site-specific musculoskeletal pain (back 26.2%, 29.7%; shoulder/neck 23.3%, 25.3%) were generally similar in UK Biobank and MUSICIAN. The prevalence of chronic pain and most regional musculoskeletal pains in UK Biobank were all within 2% of that in NCDS. CONCLUSION: UK Biobank has provided estimates of the prevalence of pain which are similar to those from previous large-scale studies, although a formal comparison of the estimates cannot be made. It has also confirmed known associations with the reporting of pain. Despite its very low participation rate, such a study provides the opportunity to investigate novel exposure-pain relationships and investigate rarer exposures and characteristics to further our knowledge of the epidemiology of pain.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26526341","10.1177/2049463715569806"

Objective: This prospective cohort study aimed to assess the association between physical activity and risk of oesophageal or gastric cancer. Methods: A cohort of 359,033 adults aged 40-69 years were identified from the UK Biobank, which recruited participants between 2006 and 2010. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between self-reported levels of physical activity and screen-based sedentary behaviour and risk of oesophageal and gastric cancer were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: During eight years of follow-up (mean = 5.5), 294 oesophageal cancer and 217 gastric cancer cases were identified. Physical activity and screen-based sedentary behaviour levels were not associated with overall oesophago-gastric cancer risk. However, when compared with low levels, high physical activity levels were associated with a significantly reduced risk of gastric non-cardia cancer (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.95). Moderate physical activity levels were associated with a 38% reduced risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.89), although no dose-response association was apparent. Conclusion: Moderate, rather than high, physical activity levels were associated with the strongest reductions in oesophageal adenocarcinoma risk in this large UK prospective cohort.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30288276","10.1177/2050640618783558"

There are also suggestions that the relation may be more evident in specific subgroups; that is, other factors may influence a relationship between hearing and depression in different subgroups. Using cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank on 134,357 community-dwelling people and structural equation modelling, this study examined the potential mediating influence of social isolation and unemployment and the confounding influence of physical illness and cardiovascular conditions on the relation between a latent hearing variable and both a latent depressive episodes variable and a latent depressive symptoms variable. The models were stratified by age (40s, 50s, and 60s) and gender and further controlled for physical illness and professional support in associations involving social isolation and unemployment. The latent hearing variable was primarily defined by reported hearing difficulty in noise. For all subgroups, poor hearing was significantly related to both more depressive episodes and more depressive symptoms. In all models, the direct and generally small association exceeded the indirect associations via physical health and social interaction. Significant (depressive episodes) and near significant (depressive symptoms) higher direct associations were estimated for males in their 40s and 50s than for males in their 60s. There was at each age-group no significant difference in estimated associations across gender. Irrespective of the temporal order of variables, findings suggest that audiological services should facilitate psychosocial counselling.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28752806","10.1177/2331216517706395"

We examined the association between probable major depression and several measurements of adiposity: BMI, waist circumference (WC), waist-hip-ratio (WHR), and body fat percentage (BF%). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using baseline data on the sub-group of UK Biobank participants who were assessed for mood disorder. Multivariate logistic regression models were used, adjusting for potential confounders including: demographic and life-style factors, comorbidity and psychotropic medication. RESULTS: Of the 140,564 eligible participants, evidence of probable major depression was reported by 30,145 (21.5%). The fully adjusted odds ratios (OR) for obese participants were 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12, 1.20) using BMI, 1.15 (95% CI 1.11, 1.19) using WC, 1.09 (95% CI 1.05, 1.13) using WHR and 1.18 (95% CI 1.12, 1.25) using BF% (all p < 0.001). There was a significant interaction between adiposity and gender (p = 0.001). Overweight women were at increased risk of depression with a dose response relationship across the overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), obese I (30.0-34.9 kg/m2), II (35.0-39.9 kg/m2) and III (>/=40.0 kg/m2) categories; fully adjusted ORs 1.14, 1.20, 1.29 and 1.48, respectively (all p < 0.001).

Some of them have been associated with changes in weight, height, and other physical traits. As most studies have been performed on children and young people, these effects of CNVs in middle-aged and older people are not well established. The UK Biobank recruited half a million adults who provided a variety of physical measurements. We called all CNVs from the Affymetrix microarrays and selected a set of 54 CNVs implicated as pathogenic (including their reciprocal deletions/duplications) and that were found in five or more persons. Linear regression analysis was used to establish their association with 16 physical traits relevant to human health. RESULTS: 396,725 participants of white British or Irish descent (excluding first-degree relatives) passed our quality control filters. Out of the 864 CNV/trait associations, 214 were significant at a false discovery rate of 0.1, most of them novel. Many of these traits increase risk for adverse health outcomes: e.g. increases in weight, waist-to-hip ratio, pulse rate and body fat composition. Deletions at 16p11.2, 16p12.1, NRXN1 and duplications at 16p13.11 and 22q11.2 produced the highest numbers of significant associations. Five CNVs produced average changes of over one standard deviation for the 16 traits, compared to controls: deletions at 16p11.2 and 22q11.2, and duplications at 3q29, the Williams-Beuren and Potocki-Lupski regions. CNVs at 1q21.1, 2q13, 16p11.2 and 16p11.2 distal, 16p12.1, 17p12 and 17q12 demonstrated one or more mirror image effects of deletions versus duplications. CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of many CNVs should be monitored for physical traits that increase morbidity and mortality. Genes within these CNVs can give insights into biological processes and therapeutic interventions.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30509170","10.1186/s12864-018-5292-7"

Whether the relationship between depression and chronic pain varies by ethnicity is unclear. This study aims to explore chronic pain and depression reporting across ethnic groups and examine whether this association differs, independently of potential confounding factors. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of UK Biobank participants with complete data on chronic pain and probable lifetime history of depression, who reported their ethnic group as White, Asian/Asian British or Black/Black British. Chronic pain classification: present if participants had >/= 1 site of body pain (up to seven sites or ""pain all over the body"" could be selected) that lasted >/= 3 months; extent of chronic pain categories: 0, 1, 2-3, 4-7 sites or pain all over the body. Probable depression classification: an algorithm of low mood, anhedonia and help-seeking behaviour. Relationship between depression and presence/extent of chronic pain assessed using logistic/multinomial regression models (odds ratio (OR); relative risk ratio (RRR), 95 % confidence intervals), adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and morbidity factors; and a final adjustment for current depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The number of participants eligible for inclusion was 144,139: 35,703 (94 %) White, 4539 (3 %) Asian, and 3897 (3 %) Black. Chronic pain was less (40.5 %, 45.8 %, 45.0 %, respectively) and depression more (22.1 %, 12.9 %, 13.8 %, respectively) commonly reported in White participants than Asian and Black participants. Statistically significant associations between depression and presence/extent of chronic pain persisted following adjustment for potential confounding variables; this relationship was strongest for Black participants (presence of chronic pain: OR 1.86 (1.52, 2.27); RRR 1 site 1.49 (1.16, 1.91), 2-3 sites 1.98 (1.53, 2.56), 4-7 sites 3.23 (2.09, 4.99), pain all over the body 3.31 (2.05, 5.33). When current depressive symptoms were considered these relationships were attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pain and depression reporting varies across ethnic groups. Differences in health seeking behaviour between ethnic groups may impact on the results reported.

Such studies are required to help elucidate the complex biological and psychological overlap between pain and mood disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between chronic multisite pain and mood disorder across the unipolar-bipolar spectrum. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 149,611 UK Biobank participants. Self-reported depressive and bipolar features were used to categorise participants into MDD and BD groups and a non-mood disordered comparison group. Multinomial logistic regression was used to establish whether there was an association between extent of chronic pain (independent variable) and mood disorder category (dependent variable), using no pain as the referent category, and adjusting for a wide range of potential sociodemographic, lifestyle and comorbidity confounders. RESULTS: Multisite pain was significantly more prevalent in participants with BD and MDD, for example, 4-7 pain sites: BD 5.8%, MDD 4.5%, and comparison group 1.8% (p < 0.001). A relationship was observed between extent of chronic pain and risk of BD and persisted after adjusting for confounders (relative to individuals with no chronic pain): 2-3 sites RRR of BD 1.84 (95% CI 1.61, 2.11); 4-7 sites RRR of BD 2.39 (95% CI 1.88, 3.03) and widespread pain RRR of BD 2.37 (95% CI 1.73, 3.23). A similar relationship was observed between chronic pain and MDD: 2-3 sites RRR of MDD 1.59 (95% CI 1.54, 1.65); 4-7 sites RRR of MDD 2.13 (95% CI 1.98, 2.30); widespread pain RRR of MDD 1.86 (95% CI 1.66, 2.08). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who report chronic pain and multiple sites of pain are more likely to have MDD and are at higher risk of BD. These findings highlight an important aspect of comorbidity in MDD and BD and may have implications for understanding the shared neurobiology of chronic pain and mood disorders.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25490859","10.1186/s12888-014-0350-4"

The aim of this study was to determine whether the associations of screen time with cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality were modified by levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, grip strength or physical activity. METHODS: In total, 390,089 participants (54% women) from the UK Biobank were included in this study. All-cause mortality, CVD and cancer incidence and mortality were the main outcomes. Discretionary television (TV) viewing, personal computer (PC) screen time and overall screen time (TV + PC time) were the exposure variables. Grip strength, fitness and physical activity were treated as potential effect modifiers. RESULTS: Altogether, 7420 participants died, and there were 22,210 CVD events, over a median of 5.0 years follow-up (interquartile range 4.3 to 5.7; after exclusion of the first 2 years from baseline in the landmark analysis). All discretionary screen-time exposures were significantly associated with all health outcomes. The associations of overall discretionary screen time with all-cause mortality and incidence of CVD and cancer were strongest amongst participants in the lowest tertile for grip strength (all-cause mortality hazard ratio per 2-h increase in screen time (1.31 [95% confidence interval: 1.22-1.43], p < 0.0001; CVD 1.21 [1.13-1.30], p = 0.0001; cancer incidence 1.14 [1.10-1.19], p < 0.0001) and weakest amongst those in the highest grip-strength tertile (all-cause mortality 1.04 [0.95-1.14], p = 0.198; CVD 1.05 [0.99-1.11], p = 0.070; cancer 0.98 [0.93-1.05], p = 0.771). Similar trends were found for fitness (lowest fitness tertile: all-cause mortality 1.23 [1.13-1.34], p = 0.002 and CVD 1.10 [1.02-1.22], p = 0.010; highest fitness tertile: all-cause mortality 1.12 [0.96-1.28], p = 0.848 and CVD 1.01 [0.96-1.07], p = 0.570). Similar findings were found for physical activity for all-cause mortality and cancer incidence. CONCLUSIONS: The associations between discretionary screen time and adverse health outcomes were strongest in those with low grip strength, fitness and physical activity and markedly attenuated in those with the highest levels of grip strength, fitness and physical activity. Thus, if these associations are causal, the greatest benefits from health promotion interventions to reduce discretionary screen time may be seen in those with low levels of strength, fitness and physical activity.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29792209","10.1186/s12916-018-1063-1"

Since vitamin D is modifiable, these observations have substantial clinical and public health implications. Indeed, many health agencies already recommend supplemental vitamin D. Here, we explore causality in a large Mendelian randomisation (MR) study using an improved genetic instrument for circulating 25-OHD. METHODS: We developed a weighted genetic score for circulating 25-OHD using six genetic variants that we recently reported to be associated with circulating 25-OHD in a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis. Using this score as instrumental variable in MR analyses, we sought to determine whether circulating 25-OHD is causally linked with CRC risk. We conducted MR analysis using individual-level data from 10,725 CRC cases and 30,794 controls (Scotland, UK Biobank and Croatia). We then applied estimates from meta-analysis of 11 GWAS of CRC risk (18,967 cases; 48,168 controls) in a summary statistics MR approach. RESULTS: The new genetic score for 25-OHD was strongly associated with measured plasma 25-OHD levels in 2821 healthy Scottish controls (P = 1.47 x 10(- 11)), improving upon previous genetic instruments (F-statistic 46.0 vs. 13.0). However, individual-level MR revealed no association between 25-OHD score and CRC risk (OR 1.03/unit log-transformed circulating 25-OHD, 95% CI 0.51-2.07, P = 0.93). Similarly, we found no evidence for a causal relationship between 25-OHD and CRC risk using summary statistics MR analysis (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69-1.19, P = 0.48). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the scale of this study and employing an improved score capturing more of the genetic contribution to circulating 25-OHD, we found no evidence for a causal relationship between circulating 25-OHD and CRC risk. Although the magnitude of effect for vitamin D suggested by observational studies can confidently be excluded, smaller effects sizes and non-linear relationships remain plausible. Circulating vitamin D may be a CRC biomarker, but a causal effect on CRC risk remains unproven.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30103784","10.1186/s12916-018-1119-2"

We examined the association of adult height with 50 diseases spanning multiple body systems using both epidemiological and genetic approaches, the latter to identify un-confounded associations and possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS: We examined the associations for adult height (using logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders) and genetically determined height (using a two-sample Mendelian randomisation approach with height-associated genetic variants as instrumental variables) in 417,434 individuals of white ethnic background participating in the UK Biobank. We undertook pathway analysis of height-associated genes to identify biological processes that could link height and specific diseases. RESULTS: Height was associated with 32 diseases and genetically determined height associated with 12 diseases. Of these, 11 diseases showed a concordant association in both analyses, with taller height associated with reduced risks of coronary artery disease (odds ratio per standard deviation (SD) increase in height ORepi = 0.80, 95% CI 0.78-0.81; OR per SD increase in genetically determined height ORgen = 0.86, 95% CI 0.82-0.90), hypertension (ORepi = 0.83, 95% CI 0.82-0.84; ORgen = 0.88, 95% CI 0.85-0.91), gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (ORepi = 0.85, 95% CI 0.84-0.86; ORgen = 0.94, 95% CI 0.92-0.97), diaphragmatic hernia (ORepi = 0.81, 95% CI 0.79-0.82; ORgen = 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.94), but increased risks of atrial fibrillation (ORepi = 1.42, 95% CI 1.38-1.45; ORgen = 1.33, 95% CI 1.26-1.40), venous thromboembolism (ORepi = 1.18, 95% CI 1.16-1.21; ORgen = 1.15, 95% CI 1.11-1.19), intervertebral disc disorder (ORepi = 1.15, 95% CI 1.13-1.18; ORgen = 1.14, 95% CI 1.09-1.20), hip fracture (ORepi = 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.26; ORgen = 1.27, 95% CI 1.17-1.39), vasculitis (ORepi = 1.15, 95% CI 1.11-1.19; ORgen = 1.20, 95% CI 1.14-1.28), cancer overall (ORepi = 1.09, 95% CI 1.08-1.11; ORgen = 1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.08) and breast cancer (ORepi = 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.10; ORgen = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.11). Pathway analysis showed multiple height-associated pathways associating with individual diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Adult height is associated with risk of a range of diseases. We confirmed previously reported height associations for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, intervertebral disc disorder, hip fracture and cancer and identified potential novel associations for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, diaphragmatic hernia and vasculitis. Multiple biological mechanisms affecting height may affect the risks of these diseases.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30355295","10.1186/s12916-018-1175-7"

A number of behaviours are linked with obesity, but are often measured separately. The UK Biobank cohort of >500,000 participants allows us to explore these behaviours simultaneously. We therefore aimed to compare physical activity, television (TV) viewing and sleep duration across body mass index (BMI) categories in a large sample of UK adults. METHODS: UK Biobank participants were recruited and baseline measures were taken between 2007 and 2010 and data analysis was performed in 2015. BMI was measured objectively using trained staff. Self-report questionnaires were used to measure lifestyle behaviours including the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ-short form) for physical activity. During data analysis, six groups were defined based on BMI; 'Underweight' (n = 2026), 'Normal weight' (n = 132,372), 'Overweight (n = 171,030), 'Obese I' (n = 67,903), 'Obese II' (n = 18,653) and 'Obese III' (n = 7000). The odds of reporting unhealthy lifestyle behaviours (low physical activity, high TV viewing or poor sleep duration) were compared across BMI groups using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Overweight and obese adults were more likely to report low levels of physical activity (</=967.5 MET.mins/wk) ('Overweight'-OR [95% CI]: 1.23 [1.20 to 1.26], 'Obese I' 1.66 [1.61-1.71], 'Obese II' 2.21 [2.12-2.30], and 'Obese III' 3.13 [2.95 to 3.23]) compared to 'Normal weight' adults. The odds of reporting high TV viewing (3 h/day) was greater in 'Overweight' (1.52 [1.48 to 1.55]) and obese adults ('Obese I' 2.06 [2.00-2.12], 'Obese II' 2.69 [2.58-2.80], 'Obese III' 3.26 [3.07 to 3.47]), and poor sleep duration (<7, >8 h/night) was higher in 'Overweight' (1.09 [1.07 to 1.12]) and obese adults ('Obese I' 1.31 [1.27-1.34], 'Obese II' 1.50 [1.44-1.56], 'Obese III' (1.78 [1.68 to 1.89]) compared to the 'Normal weight' group. These lifestyle behaviours were clustered, the odds of reporting simultaneous low physical activity, high TV viewing and poor sleep (unhealthy behavioural phenotype) was higher than reporting these behaviours independently, in overweight and obese groups. 'Obese III' adults were almost six times more likely (5.47 [4.96 to 6.05]) to report an unhealthy behavioural phenotype compared to the 'Normal weight' group. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obese adults report low levels of physical activity, high TV viewing and poor sleep duration. These behaviours seem to cluster and collectively expose individuals to greater risk of obesity. Multiple lifestyle behaviours should be targeted in future interventions.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28454540","10.1186/s12966-017-0514-y"

However, the research evidence is equivocal. Moreover, understanding the double burden of these factors is a matter of public health importance. The purpose of this study was to test associations of neighbourhood fast-food outlet exposure and household income, in relation to frequency of consumption of processed meat and multiple measures of adiposity, and to examine possible interactions. METHODS: We employed an observational, cross-sectional study design. In a cohort of 51,361 adults aged 38-72 years in Greater London, UK, we jointly classified participants based on household income ( pound/year, four groups) and GIS-derived neighbourhood fast-food outlet proportion (counts of fast-food outlets as a percentage of all food outlets, quartiles). Multivariable regression models estimated main effects and interactions (additive and multiplicative) of household income and fast-food outlet proportion on odds of self-reported frequent processed meat consumption (> 1/week), measured BMI (kg/m(2)), body fat (%), and odds of obesity (BMI >/= 30). RESULTS: Income and fast-food proportion were independently, systematically associated with BMI, body fat, obesity and frequent processed meat consumption. Odds of obesity were greater for lowest income participants compared to highest (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.41, 1.69) and for those most-exposed to fast-food outlets compared to least-exposed (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.40, 1.64). In jointly classified models, lowest income and highest fast-food outlet proportion in combination were associated with greater odds of obesity (OR = 2.43, 95% CI: 2.09, 2.84), with relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI = 0.03). Results were similar for frequent processed meat consumption models. There was no evidence of interaction on a multiplicative scale between fast-food outlet proportion and household income on each of BMI (P = 0.230), obesity (P = 0.054) and frequent processed meat consumption (P = 0.725). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated independent associations of neighbourhood fast-food outlet exposure and household income, in relation to diet and multiple objective measures of adiposity, in a large sample of UK adults. Moreover, we provide evidence of the double burden of low income and an unhealthy neighbourhood food environment, furthering our understanding of how these factors contribute jointly to social inequalities in health.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30041671","10.1186/s12966-018-0699-8"

Reference ranges permit differentiation between normal and pathological states. To date, this study is the largest to provide CMR specific reference ranges for left ventricular, right ventricular, left atrial and right atrial structure and function derived from truly healthy Caucasian adults aged 45-74. METHODS: Five thousand sixty-five UK Biobank participants underwent CMR using steady-state free precession imaging at 1.5 Tesla. Manual analysis was performed for all four cardiac chambers. Participants with non-Caucasian ethnicity, known cardiovascular disease and other conditions known to affect cardiac chamber size and function were excluded. Remaining participants formed the healthy reference cohort; reference ranges were calculated and were stratified by gender and age (45-54, 55-64, 65-74). RESULTS: After applying exclusion criteria, 804 (16.2%) participants were available for analysis. Left ventricular (LV) volumes were larger in males compared to females for absolute and indexed values. With advancing age, LV volumes were mostly smaller in both sexes. LV ejection fraction was significantly greater in females compared to males (mean +/- standard deviation [SD] of 61 +/- 5% vs 58 +/- 5%) and remained static with age for both genders. In older age groups, LV mass was lower in men, but remained virtually unchanged in women. LV mass was significantly higher in males compared to females (mean +/- SD of 53 +/- 9 g/m(2) vs 42 +/- 7 g/m(2)). Right ventricular (RV) volumes were significantly larger in males compared to females for absolute and indexed values and were smaller with advancing age. RV ejection fraction was higher with increasing age in females only. Left atrial (LA) maximal volume and stroke volume were significantly larger in males compared to females for absolute values but not for indexed values. LA ejection fraction was similar for both sexes. Right atrial (RA) maximal volume was significantly larger in males for both absolute and indexed values, while RA ejection fraction was significantly higher in females.

CMR enables accurate quantification of the cardiac chamber volume, ejection fraction and myocardial mass, providing information for diagnosis and monitoring of CVDs. However, for years, clinicians have been relying on manual approaches for CMR image analysis, which is time consuming and prone to subjective errors. It is a major clinical challenge to automatically derive quantitative and clinically relevant information from CMR images. METHODS: Deep neural networks have shown a great potential in image pattern recognition and segmentation for a variety of tasks. Here we demonstrate an automated analysis method for CMR images, which is based on a fully convolutional network (FCN). The network is trained and evaluated on a large-scale dataset from the UK Biobank, consisting of 4,875 subjects with 93,500 pixelwise annotated images. The performance of the method has been evaluated using a number of technical metrics, including the Dice metric, mean contour distance and Hausdorff distance, as well as clinically relevant measures, including left ventricle (LV) end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and end-systolic volume (LVESV), LV mass (LVM); right ventricle (RV) end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) and end-systolic volume (RVESV). RESULTS: By combining FCN with a large-scale annotated dataset, the proposed automated method achieves a high performance in segmenting the LV and RV on short-axis CMR images and the left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA) on long-axis CMR images. On a short-axis image test set of 600 subjects, it achieves an average Dice metric of 0.94 for the LV cavity, 0.88 for the LV myocardium and 0.90 for the RV cavity. The mean absolute difference between automated measurement and manual measurement is 6.1 mL for LVEDV, 5.3 mL for LVESV, 6.9 gram for LVM, 8.5 mL for RVEDV and 7.2 mL for RVESV. On long-axis image test sets, the average Dice metric is 0.93 for the LA cavity (2-chamber view), 0.95 for the LA cavity (4-chamber view) and 0.96 for the RA cavity (4-chamber view). The performance is comparable to human inter-observer variability. CONCLUSIONS: We show that an automated method achieves a performance on par with human experts in analysing CMR images and deriving clinically relevant measures.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30217194","10.1186/s12968-018-0471-x"

The presence of gene-by-sex (GxS) interactions implies that trait genetic architecture differs between men and women. Here, we show that GxS interactions and genetic heterogeneity among sexes are small but common features of a range of high-level complex traits. RESULTS: We analyzed 19 complex traits measured in 54,040 unrelated men and 59,820 unrelated women from the UK Biobank cohort to estimate autosomal genetic correlations and heritability differences between men and women. For 13 of the 19 traits examined, there is evidence that the trait measured is genetically different between males and females. We find that estimates of genetic correlations, based on ~114,000 unrelated individuals and ~19,000 related individuals from the same cohort, are largely consistent. Genetic predictors using a sex-specific model that incorporated GxS interactions led to a relative improvement of up to 4 % (mean 1.4 % across all relevant phenotypes) over those provided by a sex-agnostic model. This further supports the hypothesis of the presence of sexual genetic heterogeneity across high-level phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The sex-specific environment seems to play a role in changing genotype expression across a range of human complex traits. Further studies of GxS interactions for high-level human traits may shed light on the molecular mechanisms that lead to biological differences between men and women. However, this may be a challenging endeavour due to the likely small effects of the interactions at individual loci.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27473438","10.1186/s13059-016-1025-x"

RESULTS: Here, we identify putative functional coding variation associated with changes in the QRS interval duration by combining Illumina HumanExome BeadChip genotype data from 77,898 participants of European ancestry and 7695 of African descent in our discovery cohort, followed by replication in 111,874 individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank and deCODE cohorts. We identify ten novel loci, seven within coding regions, including ADAMTS6, significantly associated with QRS duration in gene-based analyses. ADAMTS6 encodes a secreted metalloprotease of currently unknown function. In vitro validation analysis shows that the QRS-associated variants lead to impaired ADAMTS6 secretion and loss-of function analysis in mice demonstrates a previously unappreciated role for ADAMTS6 in connexin 43 gap junction expression, which is essential for myocardial conduction.

Here, we first seek to confirm the association between cognition and anaemia and secondly, in order to further understand the mechanism of this association, to estimate the direction of causation using Mendelian randomisation. METHODS: Two independent cohorts were used in this analysis: AddNeuroMed, a longitudinal study of 738 subjects including AD and age-matched controls with blood cell measures, cognitive assessments and gene expression data from blood; and UK Biobank, a study of 502,649 healthy participants, aged 40-69 years with cognitive test measures and blood cell indices at baseline. General linear models were calculated using cognitive function as the outcome with correction for age, sex and education. In UK Biobank, SNPs with known blood cell measure associations were analysed with Mendelian randomisation to estimate direction of causality. In AddNeuroMed, gene expression data was used in pathway enrichment analysis to identify associations reflecting biological function. RESULTS: Both sample sets evidence a reproducible association between cognitive performance and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), a measure of average mass of haemoglobin per red blood cell. Furthermore, in the AddNeuroMed cohort, where longitudinal samples were available, we showed a greater decline in red blood cell indices for AD patients when compared to controls (p values between 0.05 and 10(-6)). In the UK Biobank cohort, we found lower haemoglobin in participants with reduced cognitive function. There was a significant association for MCH and red blood cell distribution width (RDW, a measure of cell volume variability) compared to four cognitive function tests including reaction time and reasoning (p < 0.0001). Using Mendelian randomisation, we then showed a significant effect of MCH on the verbal-numeric and numeric traits, implying that anaemia has causative effect on cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: Lower haemoglobin levels in blood are associated to poor cognitive function and AD. We have used UK Biobank SNP data to determine the relationship between cognitive testing and haemoglobin measures and suggest that haemoglobin level and therefore anaemia does have a primary causal impact on cognitive performance.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29954452","10.1186/s13073-018-0556-z"

These definitions were tested for association with 30 urate-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, and ratio of waist circumference to height. Heritability estimates under an additive model were generated using GCTA version 1.26.0 and PLINK version 1.90b3.32 by partitioning the genome. RESULTS: There were 2066 (1.96%) cases defined by self-report of gout, 1652 (1.57%) defined by urate-lowering therapy (ULT) use, 382 (0.36%) defined by hospital diagnosis, 1861 (1.76%) defined by hospital diagnosis or gout-specific medications and 2295 (2.18%) defined by self-report of gout or ULT use. Association with gout at experiment-wide significance (P < 0.0017) was observed for 13 SNPs with gout using the self-report of gout or ULT use definition, 12 SNPs using the self-report of gout definition, 11 SNPs using the hospital diagnosis or gout-specific medication definition, 10 SNPs using ULT use definition and 3 SNPs using hospital diagnosis definition. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.282 to 0.308 for all definitions except hospital diagnosis (0.236). CONCLUSIONS: Of the limited items available in multipurpose cohorts, the case definition of self-report of gout or ULT use has high sensitivity and precision for detecting association in genetic epidemiological studies of gout.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28793914","10.1186/s13075-017-1390-1"

Specific alleles of the GCKR, ABCG2, MLXIPL, and CYP1A2 genes have been associated with both reduced coffee intake and increased serum urate in separate genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The aim of this study was to determine whether these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influence the risk of gout through their effects on coffee consumption. METHODS: This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource. Data were available for 130,966 European participants aged 40-69 years. Gout status and coffee intake were tested for association with four urate-associated SNPs: GCKR (rs1260326), ABCG2 (rs2231142), MLXIPL (rs1178977), and CYP1A2 (rs2472297). Multiple regression and path analysis were used to examine whether coffee consumption mediated the effect of the SNPs on gout risk. RESULTS: Coffee consumption was inversely associated with gout (multivariate adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval (CI)) for any coffee consumption 0.75 (0.67-0.84, P = 9 x 10(-7))). There was also evidence of a dose-effect with multivariate adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) per cup consumed per day of 0.85 (0.82-0.87, P = 9 x 10(-32)). The urate-increasing GCKR, ABCG2, MLXIPL, and CYP1A2 alleles were associated with reduced daily coffee consumption, with the strongest associations for CYP1A2 (beta -0.30, P = 8 x 10(-40)), and MLXIPL (beta -0.17, P = 3 x 10(-8)), and weaker associations for GCKR (beta -0.07, P = 3 x 10(-10)) and ABCG2 (beta -0.09, P = 2 x 10(-9)). The urate-increasing GCKR and ABCG2 alleles were associated with gout (multivariate adjusted p < 5 x 10(-8) for both), but the urate-increasing MLXIPL and CYP1A2 alleles were not. In mediation analysis, the direct effects of GCKR and ABCG2 accounted for most of the total effect on gout risk, with much smaller indirect effects mediated by coffee consumption. CONCLUSION: Coffee consumption is inversely associated with risk of gout. Although alleles at several SNPs associate with both lower coffee consumption and higher risk of gout, these SNPs largely influence gout risk directly, rather than indirectly through effects on coffee consumption.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29976226","10.1186/s13075-018-1629-5"

The aim of this study was to systematically examine whether serum urate-associated genetic variants differ in their influence on gout risk in men and women. METHODS: This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource. Thirty single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with serum urate were tested for their association with gout in men and women of European ancestry, aged 40-69 years. Gene-sex interactions for gout risk were analysed using an interaction analysis in logistic regression models. RESULTS: Gout was present in 6768 (4.1%) men and 574 (0.3%) women, with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for men 13.42 (12.32-14.62) compared with women. In men, experiment-wide association with gout was observed for 21 of the 30 serum urate-associated SNPs tested, and in women for three of the 30 SNPs. Evidence for gene-sex interaction was observed for ABCG2 (rs2231142) and PDZK1 (rs1471633), with the interaction in ABCG2 driven by an amplified effect in men and in PDZK1 by an absence of effect in women. Similar findings were observed in a sensitivity analysis which excluded pre-menopausal women. For the other SNPs tested, no significant gene-sex interactions were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In a large population of European ancestry, ABCG2 and PDZK1 gene-sex interactions exist for gout risk, with the serum urate-raising alleles exerting a greater influence on gout risk in men than in women. In contrast, other serum urate-associated genetic variants do not demonstrate significant gene-sex interactions for gout risk.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626429","10.1186/s13075-018-1787-5"

To date, studies investigating possible associations between birth weight and bipolar disorder (BD), or personality traits known to predispose to affective disorders such as neuroticism, have not been conducted in large cohorts. AIMS: To assess whether very low birth weight (<1500 g) and low birth weight (1500-2490 g) were associated with higher neuroticism scores assessed in middle age, and lifetime history of either MDD or BD. We controlled for possible confounding factors. METHOD: Retrospective cohort study using baseline data on the 83 545 UK Biobank participants with detailed mental health and birth weight data. Main outcomes were prevalent MDD and BD, and neuroticism assessed using the Eysenck Personality Inventory Neuroticism scale - Revised (EPIN-R). RESULTS: Referent to normal birth weight, very low/low birth weight were associated with higher neuroticism scores, increased MDD and BD. The associations between birth weight category and MDD were partially mediated by higher neuroticism.

Here, we present the raw and adjusted co-occurrence rates of cancer and CVD in the overall population by using a visually intuitive network approach. METHODS: By using baseline survey and linked health outcome data from 490,842 individuals age 40 to 69 years from the UK Biobank, we recorded diagnoses between 1997 and 2014 of specific cancers and specific CVDs ascertained through hospital claims. We measured raw and adjusted rates of CVD for the following groups: individuals with Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung and trachea cancer, uterus cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, or no recorded diagnosed cancer during this time period. Analysis accounted for age, sex, and behavioral risk factors, without regard to the order of occurrence of cancer and CVD. RESULTS: A significantly increased rate of CVD was found in patients with multiple types of cancers, including Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and lung and trachea, uterus, colorectal, and breast cancer, compared with patients without cancer by using age and sex-adjusted models. Increased co-occurrence for many CVD categories remained after correction for behavioral risk factors. Construction of co-occurrence networks highlighted heart failure as a shared CVD diagnosis across multiple cancer types, including breast cancer, lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and colorectal cancer. Smoking, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors accounted for some but not all of the increased co-occurrence for many of the CVD diagnoses. CONCLUSION: Increased co-occurrence of several common CVD conditions is seen widely across multiple malignancies, and shared diagnoses, such as heart failure, were highlighted by using network methods.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30657376","10.1200/CCI.16.00071"

We sought to develop and internally validate a model incorporating lung function using data from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study. Methods This analysis included 502,321 participants without a previous diagnosis of lung cancer, predominantly between 40 and 70 years of age. We used flexible parametric survival models to estimate the 2-year probability of lung cancer, accounting for the competing risk of death. Models included predictors previously shown to be associated with lung cancer risk, including sex, variables related to smoking history and nicotine addiction, medical history, family history of lung cancer, and lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]). Results During accumulated follow-up of 1,469,518 person-years, there were 738 lung cancer diagnoses. A model incorporating all predictors had excellent discrimination (concordance (c)-statistic [95% CI] = 0.85 [0.82 to 0.87]). Internal validation suggested that the model will discriminate well when applied to new data (optimism-corrected c-statistic = 0.84). The full model, including FEV1, also had modestly superior discriminatory power than one that was designed solely on the basis of questionnaire variables (c-statistic = 0.84 [0.82 to 0.86]; optimism-corrected c-statistic = 0.83; pFEV1 = 3.4 x 10(-13)). The full model had better discrimination than standard lung cancer screening eligibility criteria (c-statistic = 0.66 [0.64 to 0.69]). Conclusion A risk prediction model that includes lung function has strong predictive ability, which could improve eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening programs.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28095156","10.1200/JCO.2016.69.2467"

Objective: To evaluate the possible causal effect of serum E2 and T on fracture risk in men. Design, Setting, and Participants: A Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was undertaken using individual-level data on genotypes, BMD as estimated by quantitative ultrasound of the heel (eBMD), fractures (n = 17,650), and relevant covariates of 175,583 unrelated men of European origin from the UK Biobank. The genetic instruments for serum E2 and T were taken from the most recent large-scale genome-wide association study meta-analyses on these hormones in men. Results: MR analyses demonstrated a causal effect of serum E2 on eBMD and fracture risk. A 1 SD (or 9.6 pg/mL) genetically instrumented decrease in serum E2 levels was associated with a 0.38 SD decrease in eBMD (P value: 9.7 x 10-74) and an increased risk of any fracture (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.18, 1.55), nonvertebral major osteoporotic fractures (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.35, 2.27), and wrist fractures (OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.62, 3.16). These causal effects of serum E2 levels on fracture risk were robust in sensitivity analyses and remained unchanged in stratified analyses for age, body mass index, eBMD, smoking status, and physical activity. MR analyses revealed no evidence of a causal effect of T levels on fracture risk.

Brain images were produced with structural MRI. RESULTS: After adjustment for a range of covariates, higher levels of all obesity measures were related to lower gray matter volume: BMI per 1 SD (beta coefficient -4,113, 95% confidence interval [CI] -4,862 to -3,364), WHR (beta coefficient -4,272, 95% CI -5,280 to -3,264), and fat mass (beta coefficient -4,590, 95% CI -5,386 to -3,793). The combination of overall obesity (BMI >/=30 kg/m(2)) and central obesity (WHR >0.85 for women, >0.90 for men) was associated with the lowest gray matter compared with that in lean adults. In hypothesis-free testing with a Bonferroni correction, obesity was also related to various regional brain volumes, including caudate, putamen, pallidum, and nucleus accumbens. No associations between obesity and white matter were apparent.

We estimated the all-cause mortality risk reductions associated with substituting leisure screen time with different discretionary physical activity types, and the change in mortality incidence associated with different substitution scenarios. METHODS: A total of 423,659 UK Biobank participants, without stroke, myocardial infarction, or cancer history, were followed for 7.6 (1.4) yr, median (interquartile range [IQR]). They reported leisure screen time (TV watching and home computer use) and leisure/home activities, categorized as daily life activities (walking for pleasure, light do-it-yourself [DIY], and heavy DIY) and structured exercise (strenuous sports and other exercises). Isotemporal substitution modeling in Cox regression provided hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for all-cause mortality when substituting screen time (30 min.d) with different discretionary activity types of the same duration. Potential impact fractions estimated the proportional change in mortality incidence associated with different substitution scenarios. RESULTS: During 3,202,105 person-years of follow-up, 8928 participants died. Each 30-min.d difference in screen time was associated with lower mortality hazard when modeling substitution of screen time by an equal amount of daily life activities (0.95, 0.94-0.97), as well as structured exercise (0.87, 0.84-0.90). Reallocations from screen time into specific activity subtypes suggested different reductions in mortality hazard: walking for pleasure (0.95, 0.92-0.98), light DIY (0.97, 0.94-1.00), heavy DIY (0.93, 0.90-0.96), strenuous sports (0.87, 0.79-0.95), and other exercises (0.88, 0.84-0.91). The lowest hazard estimates were found when modeling replacement of TV viewing. Potential impact fractions ranged from 4.3% (30-min.d substitution of screen time into light DIY) to 14.9% (TV viewing into strenuous sports). CONCLUSION: Substantial public health benefits could be gained by replacing small amounts of screen time with daily life activities and structured exercise. Daily life activities may provide feasible screen time alternatives, if structured exercise is initially too ambitious.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28106621","10.1249/MSS.0000000000001206"

METHODS: UK Biobank participants (318,185 [54%] women) age 40 to 69 yr were included. Walking pace and total walking time were self-reported. The outcomes comprised: all-cause mortality as well as incidence and mortality from CVD, respiratory disease and cancer. The associations were investigated using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Over a mean of 5.0 yr [ranging from 3.3 to 7.8], 5890 participants died, 18,568 developed CVD, 5430 respiratory disease and 19,234 cancer.

This may be related in part to sample size issues, which also preclude analysis in potentially vulnerable subgroups. OBJECTIVES: We estimated associations between air pollution exposures and the prevalence of wheeze and shortness of breath using harmonized baseline data from two very large European cohorts, Lifelines (2006-2013) and UK Biobank (2006-2010). Our aim was also to determine whether the relationship between air pollution and respiratory symptom prevalence differed between individuals with different characteristics. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses explored associations between prevalence of self-reported wheeze and shortness of breath and annual mean particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5mum, 2.5-10mum, and <10mum (PM2.5, PMcoarse, and PM10, respectively) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations at place of residence using logistic regression. Subgroup analyses and tests for interaction were performed for age, sex, smoking status, household income, obesity status, and asthma status. RESULTS: All PM exposures were associated with respiratory symptoms based on single-pollutant models, with the largest associations seen for PM2.5 with prevalence of wheezing {odds ratio (OR)=1.16 per 5mug/m(3) [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11, 1.21]} and shortness of breath [OR=1.61 per 5mug/m(3) (95% CI: 1.45, 1.78)]. The association between shortness of breath and a 5-mug/m(3) increment in PM2.5 was significantly higher for individuals from lower-[OR=1.73 (95% CI: 1.52, 1.97)] versus higher-income households [OR=1.31 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.55); p-interaction=0.005), whereas the association between PM2.5 and wheeze was limited to lower-income participants [OR=1.30 (95% CI: 1.22, 1.38) vs. OR=1.02; (95% CI: 0.96, 1.08); p-interaction<0.001]. Exposure to NO2 also showed positive associations with wheeze and shortness of breath. CONCLUSION: Exposure to PM and NO2 air pollution was associated with the prevalence of wheeze and shortness of breath in this large study, with stronger associations between PM2.5 and both outcomes among lower- versus higher-income participants. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1353.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28963089","10.1289/EHP1353"

As a step towards this goal, we developed a method to examine whether individual genetic variants, or sets of genetic variants, currently influence viability. The approach consists in testing whether the frequency of an allele varies across ages, accounting for variation in ancestry. We applied it to the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort and to the parents of participants in the UK Biobank. Across the genome, we found only a few common variants with large effects on age-specific mortality: tagging the APOE epsilon4 allele and near CHRNA3. These results suggest that when large, even late-onset effects are kept at low frequency by purifying selection. Testing viability effects of sets of genetic variants that jointly influence 1 of 42 traits, we detected a number of strong signals. In participants of the UK Biobank of British ancestry, we found that variants that delay puberty timing are associated with a longer parental life span (P~6.2 x 10-6 for fathers and P~2.0 x 10-3 for mothers), consistent with epidemiological studies. Similarly, variants associated with later age at first birth are associated with a longer maternal life span (P~1.4 x 10-3). Signals are also observed for variants influencing cholesterol levels, risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), body mass index, as well as risk of asthma. These signals exhibit consistent effects in the GERA cohort and among participants of the UK Biobank of non-British ancestry. We also found marked differences between males and females, most notably at the CHRNA3 locus, and variants associated with risk of CAD and cholesterol levels. Beyond our findings, the analysis serves as a proof of principle for how upcoming biomedical data sets can be used to learn about selection effects in contemporary humans.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28873088","10.1371/journal.pbio.2002458"

In hypothesis-free exploration of comorbid conditions, disease-disease networks are usually identified by pairwise methods. However, interpretation of the results is hindered by several confounders. In particular a very large number of pairwise associations can arise indirectly through other comorbidity associations and they increase exponentially with the increasing breadth of the investigated diseases. To investigate and filter this effect, we computed and compared pairwise approaches with a systems-based method, which constructs a sparse Bayesian direct multimorbidity map (BDMM) by systematically eliminating disease-mediated comorbidity relations. Additionally, focusing on depression-related parts of the BDMM, we evaluated correspondence with results from logistic regression, text-mining and molecular-level measures for comorbidities such as genetic overlap and the interactome-based association score. We used a subset of the UK Biobank Resource, a cross-sectional dataset including 247 diseases and 117,392 participants who filled out a detailed questionnaire about mental health. The sparse comorbidity map confirmed that depressed patients frequently suffer from both psychiatric and somatic comorbid disorders. Notably, anxiety and obesity show strong and direct relationships with depression. The BDMM identified further directly co-morbid somatic disorders, e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, or migraine. Using the subnetwork of depression and metabolic disorders for functional analysis, the interactome-based system-level score showed the best agreement with the sparse disease network. This indicates that these epidemiologically strong disease-disease relations have improved correspondence with expected molecular-level mechanisms. The substantially fewer number of comorbidity relations in the BDMM compared to pairwise methods implies that biologically meaningful comorbid relations may be less frequent than earlier pairwise methods suggested.

We identified two novel genome-wide significant SNPs: rs4932196 (odds ratio = 1.185, p = 4.0x10-11), 52Kb 3' of ISG20, which replicated in a meta-analysis of the other GERA race/ethnicity groups (1,025 cases, 12,388 controls, p = 0.00094) and in a UK Biobank case-control analysis (30,802 self-reported cases, 78,586 controls, p = 0.015); and rs58389158 (odds ratio = 1.132, p = 1.8x10-9), which replicated in the UK Biobank (p = 0.00021).

Previous research has yielded insights into its genetic etiology, but there remains a gap in the understanding of genetic factors that contribute to risk, and particularly in the biological mechanisms by which genetic variation modulates risk. The National Cancer Institute's ""Up for a Challenge"" (U4C) competition provided an opportunity to further elucidate the genetic basis of the disease. Our group leveraged the seven datasets made available by the U4C organizers and data from the publicly available UK Biobank cohort to examine associations between imputed gene expression and breast cancer risk. In particular, we used reference datasets describing the breast tissue and whole blood transcriptomes to impute expression levels in breast cancer cases and controls. In trans-ethnic meta-analyses of U4C and UK Biobank data, we found significant associations between breast cancer risk and the expression of RCCD1 (joint p-value: 3.6x10-06) and DHODH (p-value: 7.1x10-06) in breast tissue, as well as a suggestive association for ANKLE1 (p-value: 9.3x10-05). Expression of RCCD1 in whole blood was also suggestively associated with disease risk (p-value: 1.2x10-05), as were expression of ACAP1 (p-value: 1.9x10-05) and LRRC25 (p-value: 5.2x10-05). While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated RCCD1 and ANKLE1 in breast cancer risk, they have not identified the remaining three genes. Among the genetic variants that contributed to the predicted expression of the five genes, we found 23 nominally (p-value < 0.05) associated with breast cancer risk, among which 15 are not in high linkage disequilibrium with risk variants previously identified by GWAS. In summary, we used a transcriptome-based approach to investigate the genetic underpinnings of breast carcinogenesis. This approach provided an avenue for deciphering the functional relevance of genes and genetic variants involved in breast cancer.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28362817","10.1371/journal.pgen.1006690"

In this study, we examine gene-environment interactions in 362,496 unrelated participants with Caucasian ancestry from the UK Biobank resource. A total of 94 BMI-associated SNPs, selected from a previous GWAS on BMI, were used to construct weighted genetic scores for BMI (GSBMI). Linear regression modeling was used to estimate the effect of gene-environment interactions on BMI for 131 lifestyle factors related to: dietary habits, smoking and alcohol consumption, physical activity, socioeconomic status, mental health, sleeping patterns, as well as female-specific factors such as menopause and childbirth. In total, 15 lifestyle factors were observed to interact with GSBMI, of which alcohol intake frequency, usual walking pace, and Townsend deprivation index, a measure of socioeconomic status, were all highly significant (p = 1.45*10-29, p = 3.83*10-26, p = 4.66*10-11, respectively). Interestingly, the frequency of alcohol consumption, rather than the total weekly amount resulted in a significant interaction. The FTO locus was the strongest single locus interacting with any of the lifestyle factors. However, 13 significant interactions were also observed after omitting the FTO locus from the genetic score. Our analyses indicate that many lifestyle factors modify the genetic effects on BMI with some groups of individuals having more than double the effect of the genetic score.

Association summary statistics from genome-wide meta-analyses are available for hundreds of traits. Updating these to ever-increasing reference panels is very cumbersome as it requires reimputation of the genetic data, rerunning the association scan, and meta-analysing the results. A much more efficient method is to directly impute the summary statistics, termed as summary statistics imputation, which we improved to accommodate variable sample size across SNVs. Its performance relative to genotype imputation and practical utility has not yet been fully investigated. To this end, we compared the two approaches on real (genotyped and imputed) data from 120K samples from the UK Biobank and show that, genotype imputation boasts a 3- to 5-fold lower root-mean-square error, and better distinguishes true associations from null ones: We observed the largest differences in power for variants with low minor allele frequency and low imputation quality. For fixed false positive rates of 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, using summary statistics imputation yielded a decrease in statistical power by 9, 43 and 35%, respectively. To test its capacity to discover novel associations, we applied summary statistics imputation to the GIANT height meta-analysis summary statistics covering HapMap variants, and identified 34 novel loci, 19 of which replicated using data in the UK Biobank. Additionally, we successfully replicated 55 out of the 111 variants published in an exome chip study. Our study demonstrates that summary statistics imputation is a very efficient and cost-effective way to identify and fine-map trait-associated loci. Moreover, the ability to impute summary statistics is important for follow-up analyses, such as Mendelian randomisation or LD-score regression.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29782485","10.1371/journal.pgen.1007371"

Such inbreeding depression is thought to occur due to increased homozygosity at causal variants that are recessive with respect to fitness. Until recently it has been difficult to amass large enough sample sizes to investigate the effects of inbreeding depression on complex traits using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in population-based samples. Further, it is difficult to infer causation in analyses that relate degree of inbreeding to complex traits because confounding variables (e.g., education) may influence both the likelihood for parents to outbreed and offspring trait values. The present study used runs of homozygosity in genome-wide SNP data in up to 400,000 individuals in the UK Biobank to estimate the proportion of the autosome that exists in autozygous tracts-stretches of the genome which are identical due to a shared common ancestor. After multiple testing corrections and controlling for possible sociodemographic confounders, we found significant relationships in the predicted direction between estimated autozygosity and three of the 26 traits we investigated: age at first sexual intercourse, fluid intelligence, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Our findings corroborate those of several published studies. These results may imply that these traits have been associated with Darwinian fitness over evolutionary time. However, some of the autozygosity-trait relationships were attenuated after controlling for background sociodemographic characteristics, suggesting that alternative explanations for these associations have not been eliminated. Care needs to be taken in the design and interpretation of ROH studies in order to glean reliable information about the genetic architecture and evolutionary history of complex traits.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30052639","10.1371/journal.pgen.1007556"

Adults of European ancestry were included from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, and from the UK Biobank interim data release. CBP cases were defined as those reporting back pain present for >/=3-6 months; non-cases were included as comparisons (""controls""). Each cohort conducted genotyping using commercially available arrays followed by imputation. GWAS used logistic regression models with additive genetic effects, adjusting for age, sex, study-specific covariates, and population substructure. The threshold for genome-wide significance in the fixed-effect inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis was p<5x10(-8). Suggestive (p<5x10(-7)) and genome-wide significant (p<5x10(-8)) variants were carried forward for replication or further investigation in the remaining UK Biobank participants not included in the discovery sample. The discovery sample comprised 158,025 individuals, including 29,531 CBP cases. A genome-wide significant association was found for the intronic variant rs12310519 in SOX5 (OR 1.08, p = 7.2x10(-10)). This was subsequently replicated in 283,752 UK Biobank participants not included in the discovery sample, including 50,915 cases (OR 1.06, p = 5.3x10(-11)), and exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis (OR 1.07, p = 4.5x10(-19)). We found suggestive associations at three other loci in the discovery sample, two of which exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis: an intergenic variant, rs7833174, located between CCDC26 and GSDMC (OR 1.05, p = 4.4x10(-13)), and an intronic variant, rs4384683, in DCC (OR 0.97, p = 2.4x10(-10)). In this first reported meta-analysis of GWAS for CBP, we identified and replicated a genetic locus associated with CBP (SOX5). We also identified 2 other loci that reached genome-wide significance in a 2-stage joint meta-analysis (CCDC26/GSDMC and DCC).","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261039","10.1371/journal.pgen.1007601"

Its relationship with major depressive disorder (MDD) is of particular importance. We sought to test the contribution of genetic factors and shared and unique environment to risk of chronic pain and its correlation with MDD in Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS). We then sought to replicate any significant findings in the United Kingdom Biobank study. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using family-based mixed-model analyses, we examined the contribution of genetics and shared family environment to chronic pain by spouse, sibling, and household relationships. These analyses were conducted in GS:SFHS (n = 23,960), a family- and population-based study of individuals recruited from the Scottish population through their general practitioners. We then examined and partitioned the correlation between chronic pain and MDD and estimated the contribution of genetic factors and shared environment in GS:SFHS. Finally, we used data from two independent genome-wide association studies to test whether chronic pain has a polygenic architecture and examine whether genomic risk of psychiatric disorder predicted chronic pain and whether genomic risk of chronic pain predicted MDD. These analyses were conducted in GS:SFHS and repeated in UK Biobank, a study of 500,000 from the UK population, of whom 112,151 had genotyping and phenotypic data. Chronic pain is a moderately heritable trait (heritability = 38.4%, 95% CI 33.6% to 43.9%) that is significantly concordant in spouses (variance explained 18.7%, 95% CI 9.5% to 25.1%). Chronic pain is positively correlated with depression (rho = 0.13, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.15, p = 2.72x10-68) and shows a tendency to cluster within families for genetic reasons (genetic correlation = 0.51, 95%CI 0.40 to 0.62, p = 8.24x10-19). Polygenic risk profiles for pain, generated using independent GWAS data, were associated with chronic pain in both GS:SFHS (maximum beta = 6.18x10-2, 95% CI 2.84 x10-2 to 9.35 x10-2, p = 4.3x10-4) and UK Biobank (maximum beta = 5.68 x 10-2, 95% CI 4.70x10-2 to 6.65x10-2, p < 3x10-4). Genomic risk of MDD is also significantly associated with chronic pain in both GS:SFHS (maximum beta = 6.62x10-2, 95% CI 2.82 x10-2 to 9.76 x10-2, p = 4.3x10-4) and UK Biobank (maximum beta = 2.56x10-2, 95% CI 1.62x10-2 to 3.63x10-2, p < 3x10-4). Limitations of the current study include the possibility that spouse effects may be due to assortative mating and the relatively small polygenic risk score effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic factors, as well as chronic pain in a partner or spouse, contribute substantially to the risk of chronic pain for an individual. Chronic pain is genetically correlated with MDD, has a polygenic architecture, and is associated with polygenic risk of MDD.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27529168","10.1371/journal.pmed.1002090"

To overcome issues of confounding, we used Mendelian randomisation (MR), i.e., genetic variants were used as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of early puberty on post-pubertal asthma in both females and males. METHODS AND FINDINGS: MR analyses were performed in UK Biobank on 243,316 women using 254 genetic variants for age at menarche, and on 192,067 men using 46 variants for age at voice breaking. Age at menarche, recorded in years, was categorised as early (<12), normal (12-14), or late (>14); age at voice breaking was recorded and analysed as early (younger than average), normal (about average age), or late (older than average). In females, we found evidence for a causal effect of pubertal timing on asthma, with an 8% increase in asthma risk for early menarche (odds ratio [OR] 1.08; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.12; p = 8.7 x 10(-5)) and an 8% decrease for late menarche (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.89 to 0.97; p = 3.4 x 10(-4)), suggesting a continuous protective effect of increasing age at puberty. In males, we found very similar estimates of causal effects, although with wider confidence intervals (early voice breaking: OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.16; p = 0.06; late voice breaking: OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.87 to 0.99; p = 0.03). We detected only modest pleiotropy, and our findings showed robustness when different methods to account for pleiotropy were applied. BMI may either introduce pleiotropy or lie on the causal pathway; secondary analyses excluding variants associated with BMI yielded similar results to those of the main analyses. Our study relies on self-reported exposures and outcomes, which may have particularly affected the power of the analyses on age at voice breaking. CONCLUSIONS: This large MR study provides evidence for a causal detrimental effect of early puberty on asthma, and does not support previous observational findings of a U-shaped relationship between pubertal timing and asthma. Common biological or psychological mechanisms associated with early puberty might explain the similarity of our results in females and males, but further research is needed to investigate this. Taken together with evidence for other detrimental effects of early puberty on health, our study emphasises the need to further investigate and address the causes of the secular shift towards earlier puberty observed worldwide.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30086135","10.1371/journal.pmed.1002634"

Unlike other biomarkers, germline genetic markers do not change with disease progression or treatment. In this paper, we test whether a germline genetic approach informed by physiology can be used to deconstruct T2D heterogeneity. First, we aimed to categorize genetic loci into groups representing likely disease mechanistic pathways. Second, we asked whether the novel clusters of genetic loci we identified have any broad clinical consequence, as assessed in four separate subsets of individuals with T2D. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In an effort to identify mechanistic pathways driven by established T2D genetic loci, we applied Bayesian nonnegative matrix factorization (bNMF) clustering to genome-wide association study (GWAS) results for 94 independent T2D genetic variants and 47 diabetes-related traits. We identified five robust clusters of T2D loci and traits, each with distinct tissue-specific enhancer enrichment based on analysis of epigenomic data from 28 cell types. Two clusters contained variant-trait associations indicative of reduced beta cell function, differing from each other by high versus low proinsulin levels. The three other clusters displayed features of insulin resistance: obesity mediated (high body mass index [BMI] and waist circumference [WC]), ""lipodystrophy-like"" fat distribution (low BMI, adiponectin, and high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, and high triglycerides), and disrupted liver lipid metabolism (low triglycerides). Increased cluster genetic risk scores were associated with distinct clinical outcomes, including increased blood pressure, coronary artery disease (CAD), and stroke. We evaluated the potential for clinical impact of these clusters in four studies containing individuals with T2D (Metabolic Syndrome in Men Study [METSIM], N = 487; Ashkenazi, N = 509; Partners Biobank, N = 2,065; UK Biobank [UKBB], N = 14,813). Individuals with T2D in the top genetic risk score decile for each cluster reproducibly exhibited the predicted cluster-associated phenotypes, with approximately 30% of all individuals assigned to just one cluster top decile. Limitations of this study include that the genetic variants used in the cluster analysis were restricted to those associated with T2D in populations of European ancestry. CONCLUSION: Our approach identifies salient T2D genetically anchored and physiologically informed pathways, and supports the use of genetics to deconstruct T2D heterogeneity. Classification of patients by these genetic pathways may offer a step toward genetically informed T2D patient management.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30240442","10.1371/journal.pmed.1002654"

This is the first study to systematically assess the prevalence and validity of proposed criteria for probable mood disorders within the cohort (major depression and bipolar disorder). METHODS: This was a descriptive epidemiological study of 172,751 individuals assessed for a lifetime history of mood disorder in relation to a range of demographic, social, lifestyle, personality and health-related factors. The main outcomes were prevalence of a probable lifetime (single) episode of major depression, probable recurrent major depressive disorder (moderate), probable recurrent major depressive disorder (severe), probable bipolar disorder and no history of mood disorder (comparison group). Outcomes were compared on age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational attainment, functioning, self-reported health status, current depressive symptoms, neuroticism score, smoking status and alcohol use. RESULTS: Prevalence rates for probable single lifetime episode of major depression (6.4%), probable recurrent major depression (moderate) (12.2%), probable recurrent major depression (severe) (7.2%) and probable bipolar disorder (1.3%) were comparable to those found in other population studies. The proposed diagnostic criteria have promising validity, with a gradient in evidence from no mood disorder through major depression and probable bipolar disorder in terms of gender distribution, socioeconomic status, self-reported health rating, current depressive symptoms and smoking. SIGNIFICANCE: The validity of our proposed criteria for probable major depression and probable bipolar disorder within this cohort are supported by these cross-sectional analyses. Our findings are likely to prove useful as a framework for a wide range of future genetic and non-genetic studies.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24282498","10.1371/journal.pone.0075362"

Essential aspects of both hearing and cognition decline with advancing age, but it is largely unknown how one influences the other. The current standard measure of hearing, the pure-tone audiogram is not very cognitively demanding and does not predict well the most important yet challenging use of hearing, listening to speech in noisy environments. We analysed data from UK Biobank that asked 40-69 year olds about their hearing, and assessed their ability on tests of speech-in-noise hearing and cognition. METHODS AND FINDINGS: About half a million volunteers were recruited through NHS registers. Respondents completed 'whole-body' testing in purpose-designed, community-based test centres across the UK. Objective hearing (spoken digit recognition in noise) and cognitive (reasoning, memory, processing speed) data were analysed using logistic and multiple regression methods. Speech hearing in noise declined exponentially with age for both sexes from about 50 years, differing from previous audiogram data that showed a more linear decline from <40 years for men, and consistently less hearing loss for women. The decline in speech-in-noise hearing was especially dramatic among those with lower cognitive scores. Decreasing cognitive ability and increasing age were both independently associated with decreasing ability to hear speech-in-noise (0.70 and 0.89 dB, respectively) among the population studied. Men subjectively reported up to 60% higher rates of difficulty hearing than women. Workplace noise history associated with difficulty in both subjective hearing and objective speech hearing in noise. Leisure noise history was associated with subjective, but not with objective difficulty hearing. CONCLUSIONS: Older people have declining cognitive processing ability associated with reduced ability to hear speech in noise, measured by recognition of recorded spoken digits. Subjective reports of hearing difficulty generally show a higher prevalence than objective measures, suggesting that current objective methods could be extended further.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229622","10.1371/journal.pone.0107720"

The objective was to examine the link between dietary factors and presence and severity of tinnitus. DESIGN: This study used the UK Biobank resource, a large cross-sectional study of adults aged 40-69. 171,722 eligible participants were asked questions specific to tinnitus (defined as noises such as ringing or buzzing in the head or ears). Dietary factors included portions of fruit and vegetables per day, weekly fish consumption (oily and non-oily), bread type, cups of caffeinated coffee per day, and avoidance of dairy, eggs, wheat and sugar. We controlled for lifestyle, noise exposure, hearing, personality and comorbidity factors. RESULTS: Persistent tinnitus, defined as present at least a lot of the time, was elevated with increased: (i) fruit/vegetable intake (OR = 1.01 per portion/day), (ii) bread (wholemeal/wholegrain, OR = 1.07; other bread, 1.20) and (iii) dairy avoidance (OR = 1.27). Persistent tinnitus was reduced with: (i) fish consumption (non-oily, OR = 0.91; oily, 0.95), (ii) egg avoidance (OR = 0.87) and (iii) caffeinated coffee consumption (OR = 0.99 per cup/day). Reports of ""bothersome"" tinnitus (moderate-severe handicap) reduced with wholemeal/wholegrain bread intake (OR = 0.86) [corrected].Reports of less frequent transient tinnitus increased with dairy avoidance (OR = 1.18) and decreased with caffeinated coffee (OR = 0.98 per cup/day) and brown bread (OR = 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population study to report the association between dietary factors and tinnitus. Although individually dietary associations are mostly modest, particular changes in diet, such as switching between foodstuffs, may result in stronger associations. These findings offer insights into possible dietary associations with tinnitus, and this may be useful when discussing management options in combination with other lifestyle changes and therapies.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25503070","10.1371/journal.pone.0114711"

Treating hearing loss with hearing aids may ameliorate cognitive decline. The purpose of this study was to test whether use of hearing aids was associated with better cognitive performance, and if this relationship was mediated via social isolation and/or depression. Structural equation modelling of associations between hearing loss, cognitive performance, social isolation, depression and hearing aid use was carried out with a subsample of the UK Biobank data set (n = 164,770) of UK adults aged 40 to 69 years who completed a hearing test. Age, sex, general health and socioeconomic status were controlled for as potential confounders. Hearing aid use was associated with better cognition, independently of social isolation and depression. This finding was consistent with the hypothesis that hearing aids may improve cognitive performance, although if hearing aids do have a positive effect on cognition it is not likely to be via reduction of the adverse effects of hearing loss on social isolation or depression. We suggest that any positive effects of hearing aid use on cognition may be via improvement in audibility or associated increases in self-efficacy. Alternatively, positive associations between hearing aid use and cognition may be accounted for by more cognitively able people seeking and using hearing aids. Further research is required to determine the direction of association, if there is any direct causal relationship between hearing aid use and better cognition, and whether hearing aid use results in reduction in rates of cognitive decline measured longitudinally.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25760329","10.1371/journal.pone.0119616"

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using baseline data from UK Biobank. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the association between smoking and obesity; defined as body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2. Smoking was examined in terms of smoking status, amount smoked, duration of smoking and time since quitting and we adjusted for the potential confounding effects of age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, physical activity, alcohol consumption, hypertension and diabetes. RESULTS: The study comprised 499,504 adults aged 31 to 69 years. Overall, current smokers were less likely to be obese than never smokers (adjusted OR 0.83 95% CI 0.81-0.86). However, there was no significant association in the youngest sub-group (</=40 years). Former smokers were more likely to be obese than both current smokers (adjusted OR 1.33 95% CI 1.30-1.37) and never smokers (adjusted OR 1.14 95% CI 1.12-1.15). Among smokers, the risk of obesity increased with the amount smoked and former heavy smokers were more likely to be obese than former light smokers (adjusted OR 1.60, 95% 1.56-1.64, p<0.001). Risk of obesity fell with time from quitting. After 30 years, former smokers still had higher risk of obesity than current smokers but the same risk as never smokers. CONCLUSION: Beliefs that smoking protects against obesity may be over-simplistic; especially among younger and heavier smokers. Quitting smoking may be associated with temporary weight gain. Therefore, smoking cessation interventions should include weight management support.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25886648","10.1371/journal.pone.0123579"

METHODS: Non-mydriatic fundus images from both eyes of 2,690 participants--people with a self-reported history of myocardial infarction (n=1,345) and a matched control group (n=1,345)--were analysed using VAMPIRE software. These images were drawn from those of 68,554 UK Biobank participants who underwent retinal imaging at recruitment. Four operators were trained in the use of the software to measure retinal vascular tortuosity and bifurcation geometry. RESULTS: Total operator time was approximately 360 hours (4 minutes per image). 2,252 (84%) of participants had at least one image of sufficient quality for the software to process, i.e. there was sufficient detection of retinal vessels in the image by the software to attempt the measurement of the target parameters. 1,604 (60%) of participants had an image of at least one eye that was adequately analysed by the software, i.e. the measurement protocol was successfully completed. Increasing age was associated with a reduced proportion of images that could be processed (p=0.0004) and analysed (p<0.0001). Cases exhibited more acute arteriolar branching angles (p=0.02) as well as lower arteriolar and venular tortuosity (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of the retinal images in UK Biobank are of insufficient quality for automated analysis. However, the large size of the UK Biobank means that tens of thousands of images are available and suitable for computational analysis. Parametric information measured from the retinas of participants with suspected cardiovascular disease was significantly different to that measured from a matched control group.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26000792","10.1371/journal.pone.0127914"

We examined hearing, vision and cognitive function in adulthood according to self-reported birth weight (an index of prenatal development) and adult height (an index of early childhood development). Subsets (N = 37,505 to 433,390) of the UK Biobank resource were analysed according to visual and hearing acuity, reaction time and fluid IQ. Sensory and cognitive performance was reassessed after ~4 years (N = 2,438 to 17,659). In statistical modelling including age, sex, socioeconomic status, educational level, smoking, maternal smoking and comorbid disease, adult height was positively associated with sensory and cognitive function (partial correlations; pr 0.05 to 0.12, p < 0.001). Within the normal range of birth weight (10th to 90th percentile), there was a positive association between birth weight and sensory and cognitive function (pr 0.06 to 0.14, p < 0.001). Neither adult height nor birth weight was associated with change in sensory or cognitive function. These results suggest that adverse prenatal and childhood experiences are a risk for poorer sensory and cognitive function and earlier development of sensory and cognitive impairment in adulthood. This finding could have significant implications for preventing sensory and cognitive impairment in older age.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26302374","10.1371/journal.pone.0136590"

METHODS: U K Biobank, a unique contemporary resource for the study of health and disease, recruited more than half a million people aged 40-69 years. A subsample of 107,452 subjects undertook an enhanced ophthalmic examination which provided autorefraction data (a measure of refractive error). Refractive error status was categorised using the mean spherical equivalent refraction measure. Information on socio-demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity, educational qualifications and accommodation tenure) was reported at the time of recruitment by questionnaire and face-to-face interview. RESULTS: Fifty four percent of participants aged 40-69 years had refractive error. Specifically 27% had myopia (4% high myopia), which was more common amongst younger people, those of higher socio-economic status, higher educational attainment, or of White or Chinese ethnicity. The frequency of hypermetropia increased with age (7% at 40-44 years increasing to 46% at 65-69 years), was higher in women and its severity was associated with ethnicity (moderate or high hypermetropia at least 30% less likely in non-White ethnic groups compared to White). CONCLUSIONS: Refractive error is a significant public health issue for the UK and this study provides contemporary data on adults for planning services, health economic modelling and monitoring of secular trends. Further investigation of risk factors is necessary to inform strategies for prevention. There is scope to do this through the planned longitudinal extension of the UK Biobank study.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26430771","10.1371/journal.pone.0139780"

These measures will be used in a range of future studies of health outcomes in this cohort. The format and content of the cognitive tasks were partly novel. The aim of the present study was to validate and characterize the cognitive data: to describe the inter-correlational structure of the cognitive variables at baseline assessment, and the degree of stability in scores across longitudinal assessment. Baseline cognitive data were used to examine the inter-correlational/factor-structure, using principal components analysis (PCA). We also assessed the degree of stability in cognitive scores in the subsample of participants with repeat data. The different tests of cognitive ability showed significant raw inter-correlations in the expected directions. PCA suggested a one-factor solution (eigenvalue = 1.60), which accounted for around 40% of the variance. Scores showed varying levels of stability across time-points (intraclass correlation range = 0.16 to 0.65). UK Biobank cognitive data has the potential to be a significant resource for researchers looking to investigate predictors and modifiers of cognitive abilities and associated health outcomes in the general population.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27110937","10.1371/journal.pone.0154222"

Type 2 diabetes is a key exposure and outcome. We developed algorithms to define prevalent and incident diabetes for UK Biobank. The algorithms will be implemented by UK Biobank and their results made available to researchers on request. METHODS: We used UK Biobank self-reported medical history and medication to assign prevalent diabetes and type, and tested this against linked primary and secondary care data in Welsh UK Biobank participants. Additionally, we derived and tested algorithms for incident diabetes using linked primary and secondary care data in the English Clinical Practice Research Datalink, and ran these on secondary care data in UK Biobank. RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE: For prevalent diabetes, 0.001% and 0.002% of people classified as ""diabetes unlikely"" in UK Biobank had evidence of diabetes in their primary or secondary care record respectively. Of those classified as ""probable"" type 2 diabetes, 75% and 96% had specific type 2 diabetes codes in their primary and secondary care records. For incidence, 95% of people with the type 2 diabetes-specific C10F Read code in primary care had corroborative evidence of diabetes from medications, blood testing or diabetes specific process of care codes. Only 41% of people identified with type 2 diabetes in primary care had secondary care evidence of type 2 diabetes. In contrast, of incident cases using ICD-10 type 2 diabetes specific codes in secondary care, 77% had corroborative evidence of diabetes in primary care. We suggest our definition of prevalent diabetes from UK Biobank baseline data has external validity, and recommend that specific primary care Read codes should be used for incident diabetes to ensure precision. Secondary care data should be used for incident diabetes with caution, as around half of all cases are missed, and a quarter have no corroborative evidence of diabetes in primary care.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27631769","10.1371/journal.pone.0162388"

Manually segmenting muscle and fat compartments in MR body-images is laborious and time-consuming, hindering implementation in large cohorts. In the present study, the feasibility and success-rate of a Dixon-based MR scan followed by an intensity-normalised, non-rigid, multi-atlas based segmentation was investigated in a cohort of 3,000 subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3,000 participants in the in-depth phenotyping arm of the UK Biobank imaging study underwent a comprehensive MR examination. All subjects were scanned using a 1.5 T MR-scanner with the dual-echo Dixon Vibe protocol, covering neck to knees. Subjects were scanned with six slabs in supine position, without localizer. Automated body composition analysis was performed using the AMRA Profiler system, to segment and quantify visceral adipose tissue (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT) and thigh muscles. Technical quality assurance was performed and a standard set of acceptance/rejection criteria was established. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all volume measurements and quality assurance metrics. RESULTS: Of the 3,000 subjects, 2,995 (99.83%) were analysable for body fat, 2,828 (94.27%) were analysable when body fat and one thigh was included, and 2,775 (92.50%) were fully analysable for body fat and both thigh muscles. Reasons for not being able to analyse datasets were mainly due to missing slabs in the acquisition, or patient positioned so that large parts of the volume was outside of the field-of-view. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study showed that the rapid UK Biobank MR-protocol was well tolerated by most subjects and sufficiently robust to achieve very high success-rate for body composition analysis. This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27662190","10.1371/journal.pone.0163332"

METHODS: In UK Biobank, OCT images were acquired between 2009 and 2010 using a commercially available ""spectral domain"" OCT device (3D OCT-1000, Topcon). Images were obtained using a raster scan protocol, 6 mm x 6 mm in area, and consisting of 128 B-scans. OCT image sets were stored on UK Biobank servers in a central repository, adjacent to high performance computers. Rapid, automated analysis of retinal thickness was performed using custom image segmentation software developed by the Topcon Advanced Biomedical Imaging Laboratory (TABIL). This software employs dual-scale gradient information to allow for automated segmentation of nine intraretinal boundaries in a rapid fashion. RESULTS: 67,321 participants (134,642 eyes) in UK Biobank underwent OCT imaging of both eyes as part of the ocular module. 134,611 images were successfully processed with 31 images failing segmentation analysis due to corrupted OCT files or withdrawal of subject consent for UKBB study participation. Average time taken to call up an image from the database and complete segmentation analysis was approximately 120 seconds per data set per login, and analysis of the entire dataset was completed in approximately 28 days. CONCLUSIONS: We report an approach to the rapid, automated measurement of retinal thickness from nearly 140,000 OCT image sets from the UK Biobank. In the near future, these measurements will be publically available for utilization by researchers around the world, and thus for correlation with the wealth of other data collected in UK Biobank. The automated analysis approaches we describe may be of utility for future large population-based epidemiological studies, clinical trials, and screening programs that employ OCT imaging.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27716837","10.1371/journal.pone.0164095"

However, the ability to translate genetic findings from GWAS into predictive tools that are of clinical utility and which may inform clinical practice has, so far, been encouraging but limited. Here we propose to use a more powerful statistical approach, the use of which has traditionally been limited due to computational requirements and lack of sufficiently large individual level genotyped cohorts, but which improve the prediction of multiple medically relevant phenotypes using the same panel of SNPs. As a proof of principle, we used a shared panel of 319,038 common SNPs with MAF > 0.05 to train the prediction models in 114,264 unrelated White-British individuals for height and four obesity related traits (body mass index, basal metabolic rate, body fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio). We obtained prediction accuracies that ranged between 46% and 75% of the maximum achievable given the captured heritable component. For height, this represents an improvement in prediction accuracy of up to 68% (184% more phenotypic variance explained) over SNPs reported to be robustly associated with height in a previous GWAS meta-analysis of similar size. Across-population predictions in White non-British individuals were similar to those in White-British whilst those in Asian and Black individuals were informative but less accurate. We estimate that the genotyping of circa 500,000 unrelated individuals will yield predictions between 66% and 82% of the SNP-heritability captured by common variants in our array. Prediction accuracies did not improve when including rarer SNPs or when fitting multiple traits jointly in multivariate models.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27977676","10.1371/journal.pone.0166755"

Technological advances now make this possible. We describe the methods used to collect and analyse accelerometer measured physical activity in over 100,000 participants of the UK Biobank study, and report variation by age, sex, day, time of day, and season. METHODS: Participants were approached by email to wear a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven days that was posted to them. Physical activity information was extracted from 100Hz raw triaxial acceleration data after calibration, removal of gravity and sensor noise, and identification of wear / non-wear episodes. We report age- and sex-specific wear-time compliance and accelerometer measured physical activity, overall and by hour-of-day, week-weekend day and season. RESULTS: 103,712 datasets were received (44.8% response), with a median wear-time of 6.9 days (IQR:6.5-7.0). 96,600 participants (93.3%) provided valid data for physical activity analyses. Vector magnitude, a proxy for overall physical activity, was 7.5% (2.35mg) lower per decade of age (Cohen's d = 0.9). Women had a higher vector magnitude than men, apart from those aged 45-54yrs. There were major differences in vector magnitude by time of day (d = 0.66). Vector magnitude differences between week and weekend days (d = 0.12 for men, d = 0.09 for women) and between seasons (d = 0.27 for men, d = 0.15 for women) were small. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to collect and analyse objective physical activity data in large studies. The summary measure of overall physical activity is lower in older participants and age-related differences in activity are most prominent in the afternoon and evening. This work lays the foundation for studies of physical activity and its health consequences. Our summary variables are part of the UK Biobank dataset and can be used by researchers as exposures, confounding factors or outcome variables in future analyses.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28146576","10.1371/journal.pone.0169649"

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the lung function measures used in the diagnosis of COPD have identified a number of loci, however association signals are often broad and collectively these loci only explain a small proportion of the heritability. In order to examine the association with COPD risk of genetic variants down to low allele frequencies, to aid fine-mapping of association signals and to explain more of the missing heritability, we undertook a targeted sequencing study in 300 COPD cases and 300 smoking controls for 26 loci previously reported to be associated with lung function. We used a pooled sequencing approach, with 12 pools of 25 individuals each, enabling high depth (30x) coverage per sample to be achieved. This pooled design maximised sample size and therefore power, but led to challenges during variant-calling since sequencing error rates and minor allele frequencies for rare variants can be very similar. For this reason we employed a rigorous quality control pipeline for variant detection which included the use of 3 independent calling algorithms. In order to avoid false positive associations we also developed tests to detect variants with potential batch effects and removed them before undertaking association testing. We tested for the effects of single variants and the combined effect of rare variants within a locus. We followed up the top signals with data available (only 67% of collapsing methods signals) in 4,249 COPD cases and 11,916 smoking controls from UK Biobank. We provide suggestive evidence for the combined effect of rare variants on COPD risk in TNXB and in sliding windows within MECOM and upstream of HHIP.

We have demonstrated the feasibility and potential value of measuring liver fat content by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a large population in this study of 4,949 participants (aged 45-73 years) in the UK Biobank imaging enhancement. Despite requirements for only a single (</=3min) scan of each subject, liver fat was able to be measured as the MRI proton density fat fraction (PDFF) with an overall success rate of 96.4%. The overall hepatic fat distribution was centred between 1-2%, and was highly skewed towards higher fat content. The mean PDFF was 3.91%, and median 2.11%. Analysis of PDFF in conjunction with other data fields available from the UK Biobank Resource showed associations of increased liver fat with greater age, BMI, weight gain, high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes. Subjects with BMI less than 25 kg/m2 had a low risk (5%) of high liver fat (PDFF > 5.5%), whereas in the higher BMI population (>30 kg/m2) the prevalence of high liver fat was approximately 1 in 3. These data suggest that population screening to identify people with high PDFF is possible and could be cost effective. MRI based PDFF is an effective method for this. Finally, although cross sectional, this study suggests the utility of the PDFF measurement within UK Biobank, particularly for applications to elucidating risk factors through associations with prospectively acquired data on clinical outcomes of liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28241076","10.1371/journal.pone.0172921"

We investigated inherited genetic variation associated with RDW in 116,666 UK Biobank human volunteers. RESULTS: A large proportion RDW is explained by genetic variants (29%), especially in the older group (60+ year olds, 33.8%, <50 year olds, 28.4%). RDW was associated with 194 independent genetic signals; 71 are known for conditions including autoimmune disease, certain cancers, BMI, Alzheimer's disease, longevity, age at menopause, bone density, myositis, Parkinson's disease, and age-related macular degeneration. Exclusion of anemic participants did not affect the overall findings. Pathways analysis showed enrichment for telomere maintenance, ribosomal RNA, and apoptosis. The majority of RDW-associated signals were intronic (119 of 194), including SNP rs6602909 located in an intron of oncogene GAS6, an eQTL in whole blood. CONCLUSIONS: Although increased RDW is predictive of cardiovascular outcomes, this was not explained by known CVD or related lipid genetic risks, and a RDW genetic score was not predictive of incident disease. The predictive value of RDW for a range of negative health outcomes may in part be due to variants influencing fundamental pathways of aging.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28957414","10.1371/journal.pone.0185083"

Multivariable regression models were built to ascertain the association of risk factors on left ventricular (LV), right ventricular (RV), left atrial (LA) and right atrial (RA) CMR parameters. RESULTS: 4,651 participants were included in the analysis. All modifiable risk factors had significant effects on differing atrial and ventricular parameters. BMI was the modifiable risk factor most consistently associated with subclinical changes to CMR parameters, particularly in relation to higher LV mass (+8.3% per SD [4.3 kg/m2], 95% CI: 7.6 to 8.9%), LV (EDV: +4.8% per SD, 95% CI: 4.2 to 5.4%); ESV: +4.4% per SD, 95% CI: 3.5 to 5.3%), RV (EDV: +5.3% per SD, 95% CI: 4.7 to 5.9%; ESV: +5.4% per SD, 95% CI: 4.5 to 6.4%) and LA maximal (+8.6% per SD, 95% CI: 7.4 to 9.7%) volumes. Increases in SBP were associated with higher LV mass (+6.8% per SD, 95% CI: 5.9 to 7.7%), LV (EDV: +4.5% per SD, 95% CI: 3.6 to 5.4%; ESV: +2.0% per SD, 95% CI: 0.8 to 3.3%) volumes. The presence of diabetes or high cholesterol resulted in smaller volumes and lower ejection fractions. CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable risk factors are associated with subclinical alterations in structure and function in all four cardiac chambers. BMI and systolic blood pressure are the most important modifiable risk factors affecting CMR parameters known to be linked to adverse outcomes.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28973022","10.1371/journal.pone.0185114"

METHODS: For assessment of white matter microstructure, we used measures derived from neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) including the intracellular volume fraction (an estimate of neurite density) and isotropic volume fraction (an index of the relative extra-cellular water diffusion). To estimate differences associated specifically with blood pressure, we applied propensity score matching based on age, sex, educational level, body mass index, and history of smoking, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease to perform separate contrasts of non-hypertensive (normotensive or pre-hypertensive, N = 2332) and hypertensive (N = 2337) individuals and of normotensive (N = 741) and pre-hypertensive (N = 1581) individuals (p<0.05 after Bonferroni correction). RESULTS: The brain white matter intracellular volume fraction was significantly lower, and isotropic volume fraction was higher in hypertensive relative to non-hypertensive individuals (N = 1559, each). The white matter isotropic volume fraction also was higher in pre-hypertensive than in normotensive individuals (N = 694, each) in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus and the right superior thalamic radiation, where the lower intracellular volume fraction was observed in the hypertensives relative to the non-hypertensive group. SIGNIFICANCE: Pathological processes associated with chronically elevated blood pressure are associated with imaging differences suggesting chronic alterations of white matter axonal structure that may affect cognitive functions even with pre-hypertension.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29145428","10.1371/journal.pone.0187600"

In a UK population sample, we aimed to assess cardio-metabolic (CM) health in those taking these chronic pain medications. METHODS: 133,401 participants from the UK Biobank cohort were studied. BMI, waist cm and hypertension were compared between those on drugs prescribed for chronic pain and CM drugs to those on CM drugs only. Multiple confounders were controlled for. RESULTS: Those taking opiates and CM drugs had the worst CM health profile with a 95%, 82% and 63% increased odds of reporting obesity, 'very high risk' waist circumference and hypertension, respectively (OR [95% CI] 1.95 [1.75-2.17], 1.82 [1.63-2.03], 1.63 [1.45-1.84]), compared to those on CM drugs alone. Those taking neuropathic pain medications and CM drugs also demonstrate worse CM profile than those taking CM drugs only. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of medications for chronic pain and sleep upon CM health and obesity is of concern for these classes of drugs which have been recently labelled as dependency forming medications.

The goal of this study was to determine if handgrip strength is associated with changes in cardiac structure and function in UK adults. METHODS AND RESULTS: Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV), mass (M), and mass-to-volume ratio (MVR) were measured in a sample of 4,654 participants of the UK Biobank Study 6.3 +/- 1 years after baseline using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Handgrip strength was measured at baseline and at the imaging follow-up examination. We determined the association between handgrip strength at baseline as well as its change over time and each of the cardiac outcome parameters. After adjustment, higher level of handgrip strength at baseline was associated with higher LVEDV (difference per SD increase in handgrip strength: 1.3ml, 95% CI 0.1-2.4; p = 0.034), higher LVSV (1.0ml, 0.3-1.8; p = 0.006), lower LVM (-1.0g, -1.8 --0.3; p = 0.007), and lower LVMVR (-0.013g/ml, -0.018 --0.007; p<0.001). The association between handgrip strength and LVEDV and LVSV was strongest among younger individuals, while the association with LVM and LVMVR was strongest among older individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Better handgrip strength was associated with cardiac structure and function in a pattern indicative of less cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling. These characteristics are known to be associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29538386","10.1371/journal.pone.0193124"

This cross-sectional study examined the impact of MHT on left ventricular (LV) and left atrial (LA) structure and function, alterations in which are markers of subclinical cardiovascular disease, in a population-based cohort. METHODS: Post-menopausal women who had never used MHT and those who had used MHT >/=3 years participating in the UK Biobank who had undergone cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and free of known cardiovascular disease were included. Multivariable linear regression was performed to examine the relationship between cardiac parameters and MHT use >/=3 years. To explore whether MHT use on each of the cardiac outcomes differed by age, multivariable regression models were constructed with a cross-product of age and MHT fitted as an interaction term. RESULTS: Of 1604 post-menopausal women, 513 (32%) had used MHT >/=3 years. In the MHT cohort, median age at menopause was 50 (IQR: 45-52) and median duration of MHT was 8 years. In the non-MHT cohort, median age at menopause was 51 (IQR: 48-53). MHT use was associated with significantly lower LV end-diastolic volume (122.8 ml vs 119.8 ml, effect size = -2.4%, 95% CI: -4.2% to -0.5%; p = 0.013) and LA maximal volume (60.2 ml vs 57.5 ml, effect size = -4.5%, 95% CI: -7.8% to -1.0%; p = 0.012). There was no significant difference in LV mass. MHT use significantly modified the effect between age and CMR parameters; MHT users had greater decrements in LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-systolic volume and LA maximal volume with advancing age. CONCLUSIONS: MHT use was not associated with adverse, subclinical changes in cardiac structure and function. Indeed, significantly smaller LV and LA chamber volumes were observed which have been linked to favourable cardiovascular outcomes. These findings represent a novel approach to examining MHT's effect on the cardiovascular system.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29518141","10.1371/journal.pone.0194015"

Previous studies have identified relationships between lung function and cardiovascular structure in individuals with pulmonary disease, but the relationships in those free from diagnosed cardiorespiratory disease have not been fully explored. METHODS: UK Biobank is a prospective cohort study of community participants in the United Kingdom. Individuals self-reported demographics and co-morbidities, and a subset underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and spirometry. CMR images were analysed to derive ventricular volumes and mass. The relationships between CMR-derived measures and spirometry and age were modelled with multivariable linear regression, taking account of the effects of possible confounders. RESULTS: Data were available for 4,975 individuals, and after exclusion of those with pre-existing cardiorespiratory disease and unacceptable spirometry, 1,406 were included in the analyses. In fully-adjusted multivariable linear models lower FEV1 and FVC were associated with smaller left ventricular end-diastolic (-5.21ml per standard deviation (SD) change in FEV1, -5.69ml per SD change in FVC), end-systolic (-2.34ml, -2.56ml) and stroke volumes (-2.85ml, -3.11ml); right ventricular end-diastolic (-5.62ml, -5.84ml), end-systolic (-2.47ml, -2.46ml) and stroke volumes (-3.13ml, -3.36ml); and with lower left ventricular mass (-2.29g, -2.46g). Changes of comparable magnitude and direction were observed per decade increase in age. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that reduced FEV1 and FVC are associated with smaller ventricular volumes and reduced ventricular mass. The changes seen per standard deviation change in FEV1 and FVC are comparable to one decade of ageing.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29558496","10.1371/journal.pone.0194434"

METHODS: Data from the UK Biobank prospective study of 273,467 UK females were analyzed. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each factor were adjusted for age, family history of BC and deprivation score. The analyses were stratified by the menopausal status. RESULTS: Over the 9 years of follow up the total number of BC cases were 14,231 with 3,378 (23.7%) incident cases with an incidence rate of 2.09 per 1000 person-years. In pre-menopausal, increase in age, height, having low BMI, low waist to hip ratio, first degree family history of BC, early menarche age, nulliparous, late age at first live birth, high reproductive interval index, and long contraceptive use duration were all significantly associated with an increased BC risk. In post-menopausal, getting older, being taller, having high BMI, first degree BC family history, nulliparous, late age at first live birth, and high reproductive interval index were all significantly associated with an increased risk of BC. The population attributable fraction (PAF) suggested that an early first live birth, lower reproductive interval index and increased number of children can contribute to BC risk reduction up to 50%. CONCLUSIONS: This study utilizes the UK Biobank study to confirm associations between anthropometric and reproductive factors and the risk of breast cancer development. Result of attributable fraction of risk contributed by each risk factor suggested that lifetime risk of BC can be reduced by controlling weight, reassessing individual approaches to the timing of childbirth and options for contraception and considering early screening for women with family history in the first degree relative.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30048498","10.1371/journal.pone.0201097"

We aimed to determine the shorter and longer term associations between RDW and incident common conditions in participants free of baseline disease, followed for 9 years. We undertook a prospective analysis of RDW% using 240,477 healthy UK Biobank study volunteers aged 40-70 years at baseline, with outcomes ascertained during follow-up (</=9 years). Participants were free of anemia, CAD, type-2 diabetes, stroke, hypertension, COPD, and any cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer) at baseline. Survival models (with competing Hazards) tested associations with outcomes from hospital admission records and death certificates. High RDW (>/=15% variation, n = 6,050) compared to low (<12.5% n = 20,844) was strongly associated with mortality (HR 3.10: 95% CI 2.57 to 3.74), adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, education level, mean cell volume and hemoglobin concentration. Higher RDW was also associated with incident CAD (sub-HR 1.67: 1.40 to 1.99), heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and cancer (sHR 1.37: 1.21 to 1.55; colorectal cancer sHR 1.92: 1.36 to 2.72), especially leukemia (sHR 2.85: 1.63 to 4.97). Associations showed dose-response relationships, and RDW had long-term predictive value (>/=4.5 years after assessment) for the majority of outcomes, which were similar in younger and older persons. In conclusion, higher RDW predicted onsets of a wide range of common conditions as well as mortality in a large healthy volunteer cohort. RDW is not just a short term predictor, as high levels were predictive 4.5 to 9 years after baseline in healthy volunteers. The wide range of outcomes reflects known RDW genetic influences, including diverse disease risks.

The purpose of this work is to validate a confounder-corrected, cross-vendor, cross field-strength, in-house variant LMS IDEAL of the IDEAL method licensed from the University of Wisconsin, which has been developed for routine clinical use. METHODS: LMS IDEAL is implemented using a combination of patented and/or published acquisition and some novel model fitting methods required to correct confounds which result from the imaging and estimation processes, including: water-fat ambiguity; T2* relaxation; multi-peak fat modelling; main field inhomogeneity; T1 and noise bias; bipolar readout gradients; and eddy currents. LMS IDEAL has been designed to use image acquisition protocols that can be installed on most MRI scanners and cloud-based image processing to provide fast, standardized clinical results. Publicly available phantom data were used to validate LMS IDEAL PDFF calculations against results from originally published IDEAL methodology. LMS PDFF and T2* measurements were also compared with an independent technique in human volunteer data (n = 179) acquired as part of the UK Biobank study. RESULTS: We demonstrate excellent agreement of LMS IDEAL across vendors, field strengths, and over a wide range of PDFF and T2* values in the phantom study. The performance of LMS IDEAL was then assessed in vivo against widely accepted PDFF and T2* estimation methods (LMS Dixon and LMS T2*, respectively), demonstrating the robustness of LMS IDEAL to potential sources of error. CONCLUSION: The development and clinical validation of the LMS IDEAL algorithm as a chemical shift-encoded MRI method for PDFF and T2* estimation contributes towards robust, unbiased applications for quantification of hepatic steatosis and iron overload, which are key features of chronic liver disease.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30235288","10.1371/journal.pone.0204175"

Identification of the genetics underpinning individual differences in response to negative events (stress-sensitivity) may improve our understanding of the molecular pathways involved, and its association with stress-related illnesses. We sought to generate a proxy for stress-sensitivity through modelling the interaction between SNP allele and MDD status on neuroticism score in order to identify genetic variants that contribute to the higher neuroticism seen in individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of depression compared to unaffected individuals. Meta-analysis of genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) in UK Biobank (N = 23,092) and Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (N = 7,155) identified no genome-wide significance SNP interactions. However, gene-based tests identified a genome-wide significant gene, ZNF366, a negative regulator of glucocorticoid receptor function implicated in alcohol dependence (p = 1.48x10-7; Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold p < 2.79x10-6). Using summary statistics from the stress-sensitivity term of the GWIS, SNP heritability for stress-sensitivity was estimated at 5.0%. In models fitting polygenic risk scores of both MDD and neuroticism derived from independent GWAS, we show that polygenic risk scores derived from the UK Biobank stress-sensitivity GWIS significantly improved the prediction of MDD in Generation Scotland.

Iron overload, a condition that impacts liver health, was traditionally associated with genetic disorders such as hereditary haemochromatosis, however, it is now increasingly associated with obesity, type-2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of elevated levels of liver iron within the UK Biobank imaging study in a cohort of 9108 individuals. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken at the UK Biobank imaging centre, acquiring a multi-echo spoiled gradient-echo single-breath-hold MRI sequence from the liver. All images were analysed for liver iron and fat (expressed as proton density fat fraction or PDFF) content using LiverMultiScan. Liver iron was measured in 97.3% of the cohort. The mean liver iron content was 1.32 +/- 0.32 mg/g while the median was 1.25 mg/g (min: 0.85 max: 6.44 mg/g). Overall 4.82% of the population were defined as having elevated liver iron, above commonly accepted 1.8 mg/g threshold based on biochemical iron measurements in liver specimens obtained by biopsy. Further analysis using univariate models showed elevated liver iron to be related to male sex (p<10(-16), r2 = 0.008), increasing age (p<10(-16), r2 = 0.013), and red meat intake (p<10(-16), r2 = 0.008). Elevated liver fat (>5.6% PDFF) was associated with a slight increase in prevalence of elevated liver iron (4.4% vs 6.3%, p = 0.0007). This study shows that population studies including measurement of liver iron concentration are feasible, which may in future be used to better inform patient stratification and treatment.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576354","10.1371/journal.pone.0209340"

However, fasting hyperinsulinemia can also be driven by obesity-induced insulin resistance. We used genetic variation to isolate and estimate the potentially causal effect of insulin secretion on body weight. METHODS: Genetic instruments of variation of insulin secretion [assessed as insulin concentration 30 min after oral glucose (insulin-30)] were used to estimate the causal relationship between increased insulin secretion and body mass index (BMI), using bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis of genome-wide association studies. Data sources included summary results from the largest published metaanalyses of predominantly European ancestry for insulin secretion (n = 26037) and BMI (n = 322154), as well as individual-level data from the UK Biobank (n = 138541). Data from the Cardiology and Metabolic Patient Cohort study at Massachusetts General Hospital (n = 1675) were used to validate genetic associations with insulin secretion and to test the observational association of insulin secretion and BMI. RESULTS: Higher genetically determined insulin-30 was strongly associated with higher BMI (beta = 0.098, P = 2.2 x 10(-21)), consistent with a causal role in obesity. Similar positive associations were noted in sensitivity analyses using other genetic variants as instrumental variables. By contrast, higher genetically determined BMI was not associated with insulin-30. CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomization analyses provide evidence for a causal relationship of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion on body weight, consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29295838","10.1373/clinchem.2017.280727"

Modern biobanks will soon deliver unprecedentedly large biomedical data sets: Will the advent of big data close the gap between the trait heritability and the proportion of variance that can be explained by a genomic predictor? We addressed this question using Bayesian methods and a data analysis approach that produces a surface response relating prediction R-sq. with sample size and model complexity (e.g., number of SNPs). We applied the methodology to data from the interim release of the UK Biobank. Focusing on human height as a model trait and using 80,000 records for model training, we achieved a prediction R-sq. in testing (n = 22,221) of 0.24 (95% C.I.: 0.23-0.25). Our estimates show that prediction R-sq. increases with sample size, reaching an estimated plateau at values that ranged from 0.1 to 0.37 for models using 500 and 50,000 (GWA-selected) SNPs, respectively. Soon much larger data sets will become available. Using the estimated surface response, we forecast that larger sample sizes will lead to further improvements in prediction R-sq. We conclude that big data will lead to a substantial reduction of the gap between trait heritability and the proportion of interindividual differences that can be explained with a genomic predictor. However, even with the power of big data, for complex traits we anticipate that the gap between prediction R-sq. and trait heritability will not be fully closed.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28893854","10.1534/genetics.117.300271"

The use of linear mixed model (LMM) methodology for GWAS is becoming more prevalent due to its ability to control for population structure and cryptic relatedness and to increase power. The odds ratio (OR) is a common measure of the association of a disease with an exposure (e.g., a genetic variant) and is readably available from logistic regression. However, when the LMM is applied to all-or-none traits it provides estimates of genetic effects on the observed 0-1 scale, a different scale to that in logistic regression. This limits the comparability of results across studies, for example in a meta-analysis, and makes the interpretation of the magnitude of an effect from an LMM GWAS difficult. In this study, we derived transformations from the genetic effects estimated under the LMM to the OR that only rely on summary statistics. To test the proposed transformations, we used real genotypes from two large, publicly available data sets to simulate all-or-none phenotypes for a set of scenarios that differ in underlying model, disease prevalence, and heritability. Furthermore, we applied these transformations to GWAS summary statistics for type 2 diabetes generated from 108,042 individuals in the UK Biobank. In both simulation and real-data application, we observed very high concordance between the transformed OR from the LMM and either the simulated truth or estimates from logistic regression. The transformations derived and validated in this study improve the comparability of results from prospective and already performed LMM GWAS on complex diseases by providing a reliable transformation to a common comparative scale for the genetic effects.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29429966","10.1534/genetics.117.300360"

Accordingly, phenotypic correlations are often assumed to reflect genotypic correlations in evolutionary biology. Cheverud's conjecture asserts that the use of phenotypic correlations as proxies for genetic correlations is appropriate. Empirical evidence of the conjecture has been found across plant and animal species, with results suggesting that there is indeed a robust relationship between the two. Here, we investigate the conjecture in human populations, an analysis made possible by recent developments in availability of human genomic data and computing resources. A sample of 108,035 British European individuals from the UK Biobank was split equally into discovery and replication datasets. Seventeen traits were selected based on sample size, distribution, and heritability. Genetic correlations were calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression applied to the genome-wide association summary statistics of pairs of traits, and compared within and across datasets. Strong and significant correlations were found for the between-dataset comparison, suggesting that the genetic correlations from one independent sample were able to predict the phenotypic correlations from another independent sample within the same population. Designating the selected traits as morphological or nonmorphological indicated little difference in correlation. The results of this study support the existence of a relationship between genetic and phenotypic correlations in humans. This finding is of specific interest in anthropological studies, which use measured phenotypic correlations to make inferences about the genetics of ancient human populations.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29739817","10.1534/genetics.117.300630"

For example, predicted heights correlate approximately 0.65 with actual height; actual heights of most individuals in validation samples are within a few centimeters of the prediction. The proportion of variance explained for height is comparable to the estimated common SNP heritability from genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), and seems to be close to its asymptotic value (i.e., as sample size goes to infinity), suggesting that we have captured most of the heritability for SNPs.

To provide an evaluation of MLPs and CNNs, we used data from distantly related white Caucasian individuals (n approximately 100k individuals, m approximately 500k SNPs, and k = 1000) of the interim release of the UK Biobank. We analyzed a total of five phenotypes: height, bone heel mineral density, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and waist-hip ratio, with genomic heritabilities ranging from approximately 0.20 to 0.70. After hyperparameter optimization using a genetic algorithm, we considered several configurations, from shallow to deep learners, and compared the predictive performance of MLPs and CNNs with that of Bayesian linear regressions across sets of SNPs (from 10k to 50k) that were preselected using single-marker regression analyses. For height, a highly heritable phenotype, all methods performed similarly, although CNNs were slightly but consistently worse. For the rest of the phenotypes, the performance of some CNNs was comparable or slightly better than linear methods. Performance of MLPs was highly dependent on SNP set and phenotype. In all, over the range of traits evaluated in this study, CNN performance was competitive to linear models, but we did not find any case where DL outperformed the linear model by a sizable margin. We suggest that more research is needed to adapt CNN methodology, originally motivated by image analysis, to genetic-based problems in order for CNNs to be competitive with linear models.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171033","10.1534/genetics.118.301298"

Further, the variance explained by previously and newly identified variants decreased with increasing age in the GERA and UKB cohorts, echoed in the variance explained by the entire genome, which also showed gene-age interaction effects.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between AS and oral conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource under Application Number 26307. The UK Biobank recruited around 500000 participants throughout Great Britain. Clinical records were available for 2734 participants. Two case-control studies were conducted based on whether AS was self-reported or clinically diagnosed. Oral conditions were identified using self-reported reports of oral ulcers, painful gums, bleeding gums, loose teeth, toothache, and dentures. The association between AS and oral conditions was assessed using logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, educational level, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and body mass index. RESULTS: A total of 1307 cases and 491503 control participants were eligible for the self-reported AS study. The mean age was 58 years for the cases [7.5 standard deviation (SD)] and 57 years for the control groups (8.1 SD). Also, 37.1% of the cases and 54.2% of the control participants were females. Among the oral conditions, only oral ulcers were strongly associated with AS [1.57 adjusted odds ratio (OR); 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31 to 1.88]. For the study of clinically diagnosed AS, 153 cases and 490351 control participants were identified. The mean age for both cases and control groups was 57 years; 7.6 SD for the cases and 8.1 for the control group. Females corresponded to 26.1% of the cases, and 54.2% of the control participants. Clinically diagnosed AS was associated with self-reported oral ulcers (2.17 adjusted OR; 95% CI 1.33 to 3.53). CONCLUSION: Self-reported and clinically diagnosed AS populations have increased risk of reporting oral ulcers.

These ""favorable adiposity"" alleles are collectively associated with lower insulin levels and higher subcutaneous-to-visceral adipose tissue ratio and may protect from disease through higher adipose storage capacity. We aimed to use data from 164,609 individuals from the UK Biobank and five other studies to replicate associations between a genetic score of 11 favorable adiposity variants and adiposity and risk of disease, to test for interactions between BMI and favorable adiposity genetics, and to test effects separately in men and women. In the UK Biobank, the 50% of individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity alleles had higher BMIs (0.120 kg/m(2) [95% CI 0.066, 0.174]; P = 1E-5) and higher body fat percentage (0.301% [0.230, 0.372]; P = 1E-16) compared with the 50% of individuals carrying the fewest alleles. For a given BMI, the 50% of individuals carrying the most favorable adiposity alleles were at lower risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 0.837 [0.784, 0.894]; P = 1E-7), hypertension (OR 0.935 [0.911, 0.958]; P = 1E-7), and heart disease (OR 0.921 [0.872, 0.973]; P = 0.003) and had lower blood pressure (systolic -0.859 mmHg [-1.099, -0.618]; P = 3E-12 and diastolic -0.394 mmHg [-0.534, -0.254]; P = 4E-8). In women, these associations could be explained by the observation that the alleles associated with higher BMI but lower risk of disease were also associated with a favorable body fat distribution, with a lower waist-to-hip ratio (-0.004 cm [95% CI -0.005, -0.003] 50% vs. 50%; P = 3E-14), but in men, the favorable adiposity alleles were associated with higher waist circumference (0.454 cm [0.267, 0.641] 50% vs. 50%; P = 2E-6) and higher waist-to-hip ratio (0.0013 [0.0003, 0.0024] 50% vs. 50%; P = 0.01). Results were strengthened when a meta-analysis with five additional studies was conducted. There was no evidence of interaction between a genetic score consisting of known BMI variants and the favorable adiposity genetic score. In conclusion, different molecular mechanisms that lead to higher body fat percentage (with greater subcutaneous storage capacity) can have different impacts on cardiometabolic disease risk. Although higher BMI is associated with higher risk of diseases, better fat storage capacity could reduce the risk.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27207519","10.2337/db15-1671"

Studies of naturally occurring genetic variation can be used to anticipate the expected clinical consequences of a pharmacological therapy.

Using individual-level data from 120,286 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from four large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the impact of this variant on cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease.

We combined MRI data with genome-wide association studies of body fat percentage (%) and metabolic traits. We report 14 alleles, including 7 newly characterized alleles, associated with higher adiposity but a favorable metabolic profile. Consistent with previous studies, individuals carrying more favorable adiposity alleles had higher body fat % and higher BMI but lower risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. These individuals also had higher subcutaneous fat but lower liver fat and a lower visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue ratio. Individual alleles associated with higher body fat % but lower liver fat and lower risk of type 2 diabetes included those in PPARG, GRB14, and IRS1, whereas the allele in ANKRD55 was paradoxically associated with higher visceral fat but lower risk of type 2 diabetes.

We identified four variants in the gene ACVR1C (encoding the activin receptor-like kinase 7 receptor expressed on adipocytes and pancreatic beta-cells), which independently associated with reduced WHRadjBMI: Asn150His (-0.09 SD, P = 3.4 x 10(-17)), Ile195Thr (-0.15 SD, P = 1.0 x 10(-9)), Ile482Val (-0.019 SD, P = 1.6 x 10(-5)), and rs72927479 (-0.035 SD, P = 2.6 x 10(-12)).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: UK Biobank recruited 502,682 U.K. residents aged 40-69 years. We used baseline data on the 490,288 participants from the four largest ethnic subgroups: 471,174 (96.1%) white, 9,631 (2.0%) South Asian, 7,949 (1.6%) black, and 1,534 (0.3%) Chinese. Regression models were developed for the association between anthropometric measures (BMI, waist circumference, percentage body fat, and waist-to-hip ratio) and prevalent diabetes, stratified by sex and adjusted for age, physical activity, socioeconomic status, and heart disease. RESULTS: Nonwhite participants were two- to fourfold more likely to have diabetes. For the equivalent prevalence of diabetes at 30 kg/m(2) in white participants, BMI equated to the following: South Asians, 22.0 kg/m(2); black, 26.0 kg/m(2); Chinese women, 24.0 kg/m(2); and Chinese men, 26.0 kg/m(2). Among women, a waist circumference of 88 cm in the white subgroup equated to the following: South Asians, 70 cm; black, 79 cm; and Chinese, 74 cm. Among men, a waist circumference of 102 cm equated to 79, 88, and 88 cm for South Asian, black, and Chinese participants, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity should be defined at lower thresholds in nonwhite populations to ensure that interventions are targeted equitably based on equivalent diabetes prevalence. Furthermore, within the Asian population, a substantially lower obesity threshold should be applied to South Asian compared with Chinese groups.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24974975","10.2337/dc13-2966"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the UK Biobank, we examined associations of current (N = 272,214) and lifetime (N = 70,480) night shift work exposure with type 2 diabetes risk (6,770 and 1,191 prevalent cases, respectively). For 180,704 and 44,141 unrelated participants of European ancestry (4,002 and 726 cases, respectively) with genetic data, we assessed whether shift work exposure modified the relationship between a genetic risk score (comprising 110 single-nucleotide polymorphisms) for type 2 diabetes and prevalent diabetes. RESULTS: Compared with day workers, all current night shift workers were at higher multivariable-adjusted odds for type 2 diabetes (none or rare night shifts: odds ratio [OR] 1.15 [95% CI 1.05-1.26]; some nights: OR 1.18 [95% CI 1.05-1.32]; and usual nights: OR 1.44 [95% CI 1.19-1.73]), except current permanent night shift workers (OR 1.09 [95% CI 0.93-1.27]). Considering a person's lifetime work schedule and compared with never shift workers, working more night shifts per month was associated with higher type 2 diabetes odds (<3/month: OR 1.24 [95% CI 0.90-1.68]; 3-8/month: OR 1.11 [95% CI 0.90-1.37]; and >8/month: OR 1.36 [95% CI 1.14-1.62]; Ptrend = 0.001). The association between genetic type 2 diabetes predisposition and type 2 diabetes odds was not modified by shift work exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that night shift work, especially rotating shift work including night shifts, is associated with higher type 2 diabetes odds and that the number of night shifts worked per month appears most relevant for type 2 diabetes odds. Also, shift work exposure does not modify genetic risk for type 2 diabetes, a novel finding that warrants replication.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29440150","10.2337/dc17-1933"

We aimed to gain deeper insights into the paradox through analyzing mortality relationships with several adiposity measures; assessing subgroups with type 2 diabetes, with coronary heart disease (CHD), with cancer, and by smoking status; and adjusting for several confounders. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the general UK Biobank population (N = 502,631) along with three subgroups of people with type 2 diabetes (n = 23,842), CHD (n = 24,268), and cancer (n = 45,790) at baseline. A range of adiposity exposures were considered, including BMI (continuous and categorical), waist circumference, body fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio, and the outcome was all-cause mortality. We used Cox regression models adjusted for age, smoking status, deprivation index, education, and disease history. RESULTS: For BMI, the obesity paradox was observed among people with type 2 diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio for obese vs. normal BMI 0.78 [95% CI 0.65, 0.95]) but not among those with CHD (1.00 [0.86, 1.17]). The obesity paradox was pronounced in current smokers, absent in never smokers, and more pronounced in men than in women. For other adiposity measures, there was less evidence for an obesity paradox, yet smoking status consistently modified the adiposity-mortality relationship. CONCLUSIONS: The obesity paradox was observed in people with type 2 diabetes and is heavily modified by smoking status.

Mendelian randomization studies have only examined its relation with subtypes of CVD. We examined the relation of HbA1c with CVD and its subtypes in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used 38 genetic variants strongly and independently related to HbA1c (n = 123,665) applied to the UK Biobank (n = 392,038). We used inverse variance weighting (IVW) to obtain the associations of HbA1c with CVD, coronary artery disease (CAD), and stroke (overall and stroke subtypes). Sensitivity analyses included Mendelian randomization (MR)-Egger, a weighted median, and exclusion of potentially invalid single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We also applied the same genetic instruments to CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (Coronary ARtery DIsease Genome wide Replication and Meta-analysis [CARDIoGRAM] plus The Coronary Artery Disease [C4D] Genetics) 1000 Genomes-based genome-wide association study (n = 184,305) as a validation for CAD. RESULTS: In the UK Biobank, HbA1c was not associated with CVD using IVW (odds ratio [OR] 1.11 per %, 95% CI 0.83-1.48). However, HbA1c was associated with increased CAD risk (OR 1.50 per %, 95% CI 1.08-2.11) with directionally consistent results from MR-Egger and weighted median. The positive association with CAD was more pronounced when we excluded potentially invalid SNPs (OR 2.24 per %, 95% CI 1.55-3.25). The positive association was replicated in CARDIoGRAM (OR 1.52 per %, 95% CI 1.03-2.26). The association of HbA1c with stroke and its subtypes was less clear given the low number of cases.

However population data are scarce, and no studies have controlled for neuroticism. We examined associations between tinnitus and symptoms of depression and anxiety in a large UK population, controlling for neuroticism, to explore whether neuroticism, as previously reported, fully explains the association between symptoms of depression and anxiety, and tinnitus. DESIGN: We used the UK Biobank resource. STUDY SAMPLE: 171 728 participants answered hearing questions. RESULTS: Using generalized linear modelling, we examined associations between tinnitus (mild to severe) and symptoms of depression and anxiety.

CONCLUSIONS: Although it is not possible to determine whether tinnitus is a predisposing factor to depression, these results suggest an association. We suggest further exploration to determine the clinical significance of this association. Early psychosocial intervention aimed at reducing anxiety and depression in patients at increased risk might influence the extent to which tinnitus is experienced as troubling, and therefore psychological distress associated with it.

Objective: A healthy lifestyle has been described as 'better than any pill, and no side effects [5]. We therefore examined the relationships between healthy behaviours: low alcohol intake, non-smoking, healthy BMI, physical activity and a healthy diet, and the risk of all cancers, colon, breast and prostate cancers in a large dataset. Method: Data on lifestyle behaviours were provided by 343,150 subjects, and height and weight were measured at recruitment. 14,285 subjects were diagnosed with cancer during a median of 5.1 years of follow-up. Results: Compared with subjects who followed none or a single healthy behaviour, a healthy lifestyle based on all five behaviours was associated with a reduction of about one-third in incident cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.63-0.74). Colorectal cancer was reduced in subjects following the five behaviours by about one-quarter (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.58-0.97), and breast cancer by about one-third (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.52-0.83). The association between a healthy lifestyle and prostate cancer suggested a significant increase in risk, but this can be attributed to bias consequent on inequalities in the uptake of the prostate specific antigen screening test. Conclusions: Taken together with reported reductions in diabetes, vascular disease and dementia, it is clearly important that every effort is taken to promote healthy lifestyles throughout the population, and it is pointed out that cancer and other screening clinics afford 'teachable moments' for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29434658","10.3332/ecancer.2018.792"

Since the effect of these loci in the general population is unknown, we aimed to investigate the effect on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters and outcomes in the general population. Materials and Methods: A cohort of 6,161 individuals (median age 45 [interquartile range (IQR) 40-50] years, 49% males), with available digital ECGs, was genotyped and subsequently followed for a median period of 13 [IQR 12.6-13.4] years. Data on outcomes were collected from Danish administrative healthcare registries. Furthermore, ~400,000 persons from UK Biobank were investigated for associations between the three loci and cardiac arrest/ventricular fibrillation (VF). Results: Homozygote carriers of the C allele in rs6800541 intronic to SCN10A had a significantly larger J-point elevation (JPE) compared with wildtype carriers (11 vs. 6 muV, P < 0.001). There was an additive effect of carrying multiple BrS-associated risk alleles with an increased JPE in lead V1. None of the BrS-associated genetic loci predisposed to syncope, atrial fibrillation, or total mortality in the general Danish population.

Obesity constitutes a case example of a modern trait shaped by contemporary environment, although with considerable debates about the extent to which gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions accentuate obesity risk in individuals following obesogenic lifestyles. Although interaction effects have been robustly confirmed at the FTO locus, accumulating evidence at the genome-wide level implicates a role for polygenic risk-by-environment interactions.

METHODS: To determine the causal effect of euthyroid function, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization study of euthyroid thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels with respect to 2419 traits assessed in 337,199 individuals from UK Biobank. Additionally, we investigated the molecular differences between hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism using genome-wide data. RESULTS: After multiple testing correction, sixteen traits appear to be affected by genetically-determined euthyroid TSH, including multiple thyroid-related traits, e.g., hypothyroidism (p = 2.39 x 10(-17)), height (p = 2.76 x 10(-10)), body fat distribution (impedance of whole body, p = 4.43 x 10(-8)), pulse rate (p = 2.84 x 10(-8)), female infertility (p = 4.91 x 10(-6)), and hearing aid use (p = 7.10 x 10(-5)). Moreover, we found a consistent genetic correlation between hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (rg = 0.45, p = 5.45 x 10(-6)) with several immune pathways shared between these diseases. Two molecular pathways survived multiple testing correction for specificity to hyperthyroidism, JAK/STAT signaling (p = 1.02 x 10(-6)) and Rac guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity (p = 4.39 x 10(-6)).

However, this ""risk paradox"" is partly explained by smoking and disease-associated weight loss. This paradox may also arise from BMI failing to measure fat redistribution to a centralized position in later life.Objective: This study aimed to estimate associations between combined measurements of BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) with mortality and incident coronary artery disease (CAD).Design: This study followed 130,473 UK Biobank participants aged 60-69 y (baseline 2006-2010) for </=8.3 y (n = 2974 deaths). Current smokers and individuals with recent or disease-associated (e.g., from dementia, heart failure, or cancer) weight loss were excluded, yielding a ""healthier agers"" group. Survival models were adjusted for age, sex, alcohol intake, smoking history, and educational attainment. Population and sex-specific lower and higher WHR tertiles were <0.91 and >/=0.96 for men and <0.79 and >/=0.85 for women, respectively.Results: Ignoring WHR, the risk of mortality for overweight subjects was similar to that for normal-weight subjects (HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.19; P = 0.066). However, among normal-weight subjects, mortality increased for those with a higher WHR (HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.65) compared with a lower WHR. Being overweight with a higher WHR was associated with substantial excess mortality (HR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.25, 1.61) and greatly increased CAD incidence (sub-HR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.39, 1.93) compared with being normal weight with a lower WHR. There was no interaction between physical activity and BMI plus WHR groups with respect to mortality.Conclusions: For healthier agers (i.e., nonsmokers without disease-associated weight loss), having central adiposity and a BMI corresponding to normal weight or overweight is associated with substantial excess mortality. The claimed BMI-defined overweight risk paradox may result in part from failing to account for central adiposity, rather than reflecting a protective physiologic effect of higher body-fat content in later life.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28566307","10.3945/ajcn.116.147157"

Results: beta Values are expressed as the change in BMI (in kg/m(2)) or WC per 1-SD increase in GPRS-obesity. The GPRS-obesity was associated with BMI (beta: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.60; P = 6.3 x 10(-207)) and WC (1.21 cm; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.28 cm; P = 4.2 x 10(-289)).

Baseline data collection (2006-2010) included measurements of GS and adiposity indicators, including body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)). Age- and sex-specific GS quintiles were used. BMI was classified according to clinical cutoffs.Results: Data from 403,199 participants were included in analyses. Over a median 7.0-y of follow-up, 8287 all-cause deaths occurred. The highest GS quintile had 32% (95% CI: 26%, 38%) and 25% (95% CI: 16%, 33%) lower all-cause mortality risks for men and women, respectively, compared with the lowest GS quintile, after adjustment for confounders and BMI. Obesity class II (BMI >/=35) was associated with a greater all-cause mortality risk. The highest GS quintile and obesity class II category showed relatively higher all-cause mortality hazards (not statistically significant in men) than the highest GS quintile and the normal weight category; however, the increased risk was relatively lower than the risk for the lowest GS quintile and obesity class II category. All-cause mortality risks were generally lower for obese but stronger individuals than for nonobese but weaker individuals. Similar patterns of associations were observed for cardiovascular mortality.Conclusions: Lower grip strength and excess adiposity are both independent predictors of higher mortality risk. The higher mortality risk associated with excess adiposity is attenuated, although not completely attenuated, by greater GS. Interventions and policies should focus on improving the muscular strength of the population regardless of their degree of adiposity.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28793990","10.3945/ajcn.117.156851"

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional population data were obtained from UK Biobank (www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) study which was conducted in 2006 - 2010 and recruited over 500,000 people. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of facial pain (FP) was 1.9% (women 2.4%, men 1.2%) of which 48% was chronic. The highest prevalence was found in the 51 - 55 age group (2.2%) and the lowest in the 66 - 73 age group (1.4%). There was a difference in prevalence by ethnicity (0.8% and 2.7% in persons reporting themselves as Chinese and Mixed respectively). Prevalence of FP significantly associated with all measures of social class with the most deprived and on lowest income showing the highest prevalence (2.5% and 2.4% respectively). FP was more common in individuals who rated themselves as extremely unhappy, had history of depression and reported sleep problems. Smoking associated with increase in reporting FP while alcohol consumption had inverse association. FP associated with history of painful gums, toothache and all types of regional pain. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest ever study to provide estimates of facial pain prevalence. It demonstrates unique features (lower prevalence than previously reported) and common features (more common in women) and confirms multifactorial aetiology of facial pain. Significant association with psychological distress and a strong relationship to pain elsewhere in the body suggests that aetiology is not specific to this regional pain.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25386229","10.5037/jomr.2014.5302"

This method is time-consuming and costly and makes it potentially unfeasible to perform high quality analyses on occupational exposures in large population-based studies. Our aim was to develop a novel, efficient web-based tool to collect and code lifetime job histories in the UK Biobank, a population-based cohort of over 500 000 participants. Methods We developed OSCAR (occupations self-coding automatic recording) based on the hierarchical structure of the UK Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) 2000, which allows individuals to collect and automatically code their lifetime job histories via a simple decision-tree model. Participants were asked to find each of their jobs by selecting appropriate job categories until they identified their job title, which was linked to a hidden 4-digit SOC code. For each occupation a job title in free text was also collected to estimate Cohen's kappa (kappa) inter-rater agreement between SOC codes assigned by OSCAR and an expert manual coder. Results OSCAR was administered to 324 653 UK Biobank participants with an existing email address between June and September 2015. Complete 4-digit SOC-coded lifetime job histories were collected for 108 784 participants (response rate: 34%). Agreement between the 4-digit SOC codes assigned by OSCAR and the manual coder for a random sample of 400 job titles was moderately good [kappa=0.45, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.42-0.49], and improved when broader job categories were considered (kappa=0.64, 95% CI 0.61-0.69 at a 1-digit SOC-code level). Conclusions OSCAR is a novel, efficient, and reasonably reliable web-based tool for collecting and automatically coding lifetime job histories in large population-based studies. Further application in other research projects for external validation purposes is warranted.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27973677","10.5271/sjweh.3613"

Haplotype-based analyses are a complementary technique that take phased genotype data into account, and potentially provide greater statistical power to detect lower frequency variants. METHODS: In the present analysis, three cohort studies (n total = 48,002) were utilised: Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS), the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), and the UK Biobank. A genome-wide haplotype-based meta-analysis of cognitive ability was performed, as well as a targeted meta-analysis of several gene coding regions. RESULTS: None of the assessed haplotypes provided evidence of a statistically significant association with cognitive ability in either the individual cohorts or the meta-analysis. Within the meta-analysis, the haplotype with the lowest observed P-value overlapped with the D-amino acid oxidase activator ( DAOA) gene coding region. This coding region has previously been associated with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, which have all been shown to impact upon cognitive ability. Another potentially interesting region highlighted within the current genome-wide association analysis (GS:SFHS: P = 4.09 x 10 (-7)), was the butyrylcholinesterase ( BCHE) gene coding region. The protein encoded by BCHE has been shown to influence the progression of Alzheimer's disease and its role in cognitive ability merits further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Although no evidence was found for any haplotypes with a statistically significant association with cognitive ability, our results did provide further evidence that the genetic variants contributing to the variance of cognitive ability are likely to be of small effect.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28989979","10.12688/wellcomeopenres.12171.1"

Moreover, substantial uncertainty remains about the causal relevance of increased bone mineral density for T2D and CHD, which can be assessed by Mendelian randomisation studies. Methods: We identified 235 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated at p<5x10 (-8) with estimated heel bone mineral density (eBMD) in 116,501 individuals from the UK Biobank study, accounting for 13.9% of eBMD variance. For each eBMD-associated SNP, we extracted effect estimates from the largest available GWAS studies for T2D (DIAGRAM: n=26,676 T2D cases and 132,532 controls) and CHD (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D: n=60,801 CHD cases and 123,504 controls). A two-sample design using several Mendelian randomization approaches was used to investigate the causal relevance of eBMD for risk of T2D and CHD. In addition, we explored the relationship of eBMD, instrumented by the 235 SNPs, on 12 cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors. Finally, we conducted Mendelian randomization analysis in the reverse direction to investigate reverse causality. Results: Each one standard deviation increase in genetically instrumented eBMD (equivalent to 0.14 g/cm (2)) was associated with an 8% higher risk of T2D (odds ratio [OR] 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02 to 1.14; p=0.012) and 5% higher risk of CHD (OR 1.05; 95%CI: 1.00 to 1.10; p=0.034). Consistent results were obtained in sensitivity analyses using several different Mendelian randomization approaches. Equivalent increases in eBMD were also associated with lower plasma levels of HDL-cholesterol and increased insulin resistance. Mendelian randomization in the reverse direction using 94 T2D SNPs or 52 CHD SNPs showed no evidence of reverse causality with eBMD. Conclusions: These findings suggest a causal relationship between elevated bone mineral density with risks of both T2D and CHD.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28989980","10.12688/wellcomeopenres.12288.1"

We evaluated the impact of UK Biobank's protocol for handling potentially serious IFs in a multi-modal imaging study of 100,000 participants (radiographer 'flagging' with radiologist confirmation of potentially serious IFs) compared with systematic radiologist review of all images. Methods: Brain, cardiac and body magnetic resonance, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans from the first 1000 imaged UK Biobank participants were independently assessed for potentially serious IFs using both protocols. We surveyed participants with potentially serious IFs and their GPs up to six months after imaging to determine subsequent clinical assessments, final diagnoses, emotional, financial and work or activity impacts. Results: Compared to systematic radiologist review, radiographer flagging resulted in substantially fewer participants with potentially serious IFs (179/1000 [17.9%] versus 18/1000 [1.8%]) and a higher proportion with serious final diagnoses (21/179 [11.7%] versus 5/18 [27.8%]). Radiographer flagging missed 16/21 serious final diagnoses (i.e., false negatives), while systematic radiologist review generated large numbers of non-serious final diagnoses (158/179) (i.e., false positives). Almost all (90%) participants had further clinical assessment (including invasive procedures in similar numbers with serious and non-serious final diagnoses [11 and 12 respectively]), with additional impact on emotional wellbeing (16.9%), finances (8.9%), and work or activities (5.6%). Conclusions: Compared with systematic radiologist review, radiographer flagging missed some serious diagnoses, but avoided adverse impacts for many participants with non-serious diagnoses. While systematic radiologist review may benefit some participants, UK Biobank's responsibility to avoid both unnecessary harm to larger numbers of participants and burdening of publicly-funded health services suggests that radiographer flagging is a justifiable approach in the UK Biobank imaging study. The potential scale of non-serious final diagnoses raises questions relating to handling IFs in other settings, such as commercial and public health screening.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30009267","10.12688/wellcomeopenres.13181.3"

Small molecule CCR5 antagonists exist, including the approved antiretroviral drug maraviroc, and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are in development. Repositioning of drugs and targets into new disease areas can accelerate the availability of new therapies and substantially reduce costs. As it has been shown that drug targets with genetic evidence supporting their involvement in the disease are more likely to be successful in clinical development, using genetic association studies to identify new target repurposing opportunities could be fruitful. Here we investigate the potential of perturbation of the CCL3L1-CCR5 axis as treatment for respiratory disease. Europeans typically carry between 0 and 5 copies of CCL3L1 and this multi-allelic variation is not detected by widely used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism studies. Methods: We directly measured the complex structural variation of CCL3L1 using the Paralogue Ratio Test and imputed (with validation) CCR5del32 genotypes in 5,000 individuals from UK Biobank, selected from the extremes of the lung function distribution, and analysed DNA and RNAseq data for CCL3L1 from the 1000 Genomes Project. Results: We confirmed the gene dosage effect of CCL3L1 copy number on CCL3L1 mRNA expression levels. We found no evidence for association of CCL3L1 copy number or CCR5del32 genotype with lung function. Conclusions: These results suggest that repositioning CCR5 antagonists is unlikely to be successful for the treatment of airflow obstruction.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29682616","10.12688/wellcomeopenres.13902.2"

Within-subject declines in fluid intelligence are highly correlated with contemporaneous declines in the ability to live and function independently. To support healthy aging, the mechanisms underlying these declines need to be better understood. Methods: In this pre-registered analysis, we applied latent growth curve modelling to investigate the neural determinants of longitudinal changes in fluid intelligence across three time points in 185,317 individuals (N=9,719 two waves, N=870 three waves) from the UK Biobank (age range: 39-73 years). Results: We found a weak but significant effect of cross-sectional age on the mean fluid intelligence score, such that older individuals scored slightly lower. However, the mean longitudinal slope was positive, rather than negative, suggesting improvement across testing occasions. Despite the considerable sample size, the slope variance was non-significant, suggesting no reliable individual differences in change over time. This null-result is likely due to the nature of the cognitive test used. In a subset of individuals, we found that white matter microstructure (N=8839, as indexed by fractional anisotropy) and grey-matter volume (N=9931) in pre-defined regions-of-interest accounted for complementary and unique variance in mean fluid intelligence scores. The strongest effects were such that higher grey matter volume in the frontal pole and greater white matter microstructure in the posterior thalamic radiations were associated with higher fluid intelligence scores. Conclusions: In a large preregistered analysis, we demonstrate a weak but significant negative association between age and fluid intelligence. However, we did not observe plausible longitudinal patterns, instead observing a weak increase across testing occasions, and no significant individual differences in rates of change, likely due to the suboptimal task design. Finally, we find support for our preregistered expectation that white- and grey matter make separate contributions to individual differences in fluid intelligence beyond age.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29707655","10.12688/wellcomeopenres.14241.2"

Objective: To examine multimorbidity and its associations with sociodemographic/lifestyle risk factors and all-cause mortality in UK Biobank participants with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Design: Data were obtained from an anonymized community cohort aged 40-72 years. Overall, 42 comorbidities were self-reported by those with stroke or TIA. Relative risk ratios demonstrated associations between participant characteristics and number of comorbidities. Hazard ratios demonstrated associations between the number and type of comorbidities and all-cause mortality. Results were adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, smoking, and alcohol intake. Data were linked to national mortality data. Median follow-up was 7 years. Results: Of 8,751 participants (mean age 60.9+/-6.7 years) with stroke or TIA, the all-cause mortality rate over 7 years was 8.4%. Over 85% reported >/=1 comorbidities. Age, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking and less frequent alcohol intake were associated with higher levels of multimorbidity. Increasing multimorbidity was associated with higher all-cause mortality. Mortality risk was double for those with >/=5 comorbidities compared to those with none. Having cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease significantly increased mortality risk. Presence of any cardiometabolic comorbidity significantly increased mortality risk, as did any non-cardiometabolic comorbidity. Conclusions: In stroke survivors, the number of comorbidities may be a more helpful predictor of mortality than type of condition. Stroke guidelines should take greater account of comorbidities, and interventions are needed that improve outcomes for people with multimorbidity and stroke.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29492397","10.15256/joc.2018.8.129"

Genetic risk scores for 19 phenotypes (n=777 proven variants) were also tested. In GWAS, a nicotine receptor locus(CHRNA3, previously associated with increased smoking and lung cancer) was associated with fathers' survival. Less common variants requiring further confirmation were also identified. Offspring of longer lived parents had more protective alleles for coronary artery disease, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, type-1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and Alzheimer's disease. In candidate analyses, variants in the TOMM40/APOE locus were associated with longevity, but FOXO variants were not. Associations between extreme longevity (mother >=98 years, fathers >=95 years, n=1,339) and disease alleles were similar, with an additional association with HDL cholesterol (p=5.7x10-3). These results support a multiple protective factors model influencing lifespan and longevity (top 1% survival) in humans, with prominent roles for cardiovascular-related pathways. Several of these genetically influenced risks, including blood pressure and tobacco exposure, are potentially modifiable.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27015805","10.18632/aging.100930"

We proposed a statistical description of the locomotor activity tracks and transformed the provided time series into vectors representing physiological states for each participant. The Principal Component Analysis of the transformed data revealed a winding trajectory with distinct segments corresponding to subsequent human development stages. The extended linear phase starts from 35-40 years old and is associated with the exponential increase of mortality risks according to the Gompertz mortality law. We characterized the distance traveled along the aging trajectory as a natural measure of biological age and demonstrated its significant association with frailty and hazardous lifestyles, along with the remaining lifespan and healthspan of an individual. The biological age explained most of the variance of the log-hazard ratio that was obtained by fitting directly to mortality and the incidence of chronic diseases. Our findings highlight the intimate relationship between the supervised and unsupervised signatures of the biological age and frailty, a consequence of the low intrinsic dimensionality of the aging dynamics.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30362959","10.18632/aging.101603"
