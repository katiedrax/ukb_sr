A smaller study (n = 5,248) in adults aged 65 years and older found that lifestyle factors including not smoking, higher physical activity, better quality diet, and not being obese were associated with a compression in years of disability later in life (2), in line with previous findings from the Framingham Disability Study (3). The ARIC and Northern Manhattan studies identified an association between cardiovascular risk factors and the ability to maintain long-term functional status (4,5), and an analysis of the Seven Countries Study found a possible association with incident dementia (6).

We also report data on additional outcomes including all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer to confirm associations seen previously and hence show our measure of the CRS is valid.  Assessment of baseline outcomes (UK Biobank) UKB allowed estimation of self-reported health status, chronic pain, and frailty and measured lung function. Participants reported their health as excellent, good, fair, or poor. Reported pain anywhere in the body (back; facial; headaches; hip; knee; neck/shoulder; stomach/abdominal) was considered as chronic pain if it lasted for more than 3 months. Grip strength was measured in both hands using a hydraulic hand dynamometer and the maximum reading was categorized into sex-specific quintiles. The prevalence of frailty was estimated using a modified Fried Frailty phenotype (13) and included two or more of self-reported weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, self-reported slow walking pace, or low measured grip strength (lowest quintile, sex specific). The low physical activity criteria were excluded from our definition as this is also a component of the CRS. A previous study showed that a four-criteria definition of Fried Frailty, excluding physical activity, had good specificity (0.98) but lower sensitivity (0.62) (14).

Given that the treatments have been shown in randomized trials to be effective at CVD risk reduction, our classification of these risks as high is somewhat conservative. In CPRD, nonrecording of risk factors by general practitioners is not at random (rather likely reflecting the absence of clinical symptoms, signs, and low clinical suspicion), making multiple imputation of missing data inappropriate. We took the prudent approach of assigning those with missing values to the low CRS group and showed comparable associations between the CRS and all-cause mortality in those with and without missing data. Both of these approaches are conservative, that is, in UKB perhaps including some individuals on treatment as high risk when their true risk level was reduced and in CPRD possibly including some individuals with no data on risks recorded as not having low risks when they actually had CVD risk factors: The combined effects of these conservative approaches may have led to underestimation of true effect sizes.  In addition, in CPRD, for cholesterol and glucose measurements, a long lead-in period of up to 8.5 years were defined, with the support from clinicians, on the basis of the available data for building a cohort. This presents the possibility that people with a normal blood test value might develop the condition of interest (eg, high cholesterol and fasting glucose) and thus be misclassified. However, this misclassification will bias results toward the null and is unlikely to have influenced the direction of our results. In the CPRD primary care records, people with CVD risk factors may have been seen by primary care during follow-up more often, with better ascertainment of outcomes. However, our ascertainment of outcomes in both studies included hospital admission records and death certificates, so at least for the more severe health events, ascertainment of outcomes was likely unbiased. Also, we highlight that the inclusion of hypertension and diabetes as components of the Rockwood frailty index contribute to a higher frailty score for those with higher CRS. However, as this influence is constant for frailty estimates over time (at index date as well as throughout the follow-up period), expectation is that the effect is minimized for the analysis of frailty progression over time.  Some of the risk factor measures may reflect elements of subclinical pathology, perhaps from early life exposures that may not be amenable to intervention. However, there are many clinical trials of, for example, blood pressure and cholesterol reduction in middle age or later life that have reported large reductions in CVD risk and mortality (34,35), suggesting that risks even in midlife and later life are susceptible to change. Clearly, only randomized trials of comprehensive risk reduction for improving aging outcomes could provide definitive data, and such studies should be given high priority.  Future work should seek to study this question with a more complete set of measured risk factors. Future analyses could also separate the CRS into behavioral risk factors (eg, smoking and physical activity) and more proximal cardiovascular risk factors to tease out the effects of overlapping risk factors. Studies of inherited genetic risks could help provide unconfounded estimates for lifelong exposure to many of the studied risk factors. Interestingly, our recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of parental longevity (36) in UK Biobank found strong associations with lower genetic risks scores for several cardiovascular traits, including CVD, adverse lipid levels, and blood pressure. Our GWAS also identified a variant linked to smoking was associated with father’s survival. This suggests that genetic propensity to several of the cardiovascular risk factors used here in the CRS is associated with mortality and hence morbidity and that the CVD risk factor associations reported are likely to be causal""","""In UKB, measured cholesterol and glucose levels were not available, so we used proxy markers such as diagnoses of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes, or related treatment receipt to classify risk factor...We took the prudent approach of assigning those with missing values to the low CRS group and showed comparable associations between the CRS and all-cause mortality in those with and without missing data""","Partially","Yes","Discuss direction but not magnitude of how much the effect sizes may be underestimated ""In UKB, measured cholesterol and glucose levels were not available, so we used proxy markers such as diagnoses of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes, or related treatment receipt to classify risk factor status.

However, the research evidence is equivocal. Moreover, understanding the double burden of these factors is a matter of public health importance. The purpose of this study was to test associations of neighbourhood fast-food outlet exposure and household income, in relation to frequency of consumption of processed meat and multiple measures of adiposity, and to examine possible interactions.  Methods We employed an observational, cross-sectional study design. In a cohort of 51,361 adults aged 38–72 years in Greater London, UK, we jointly classified participants based on household income (£/year, four groups) and GIS-derived neighbourhood fast-food outlet proportion (counts of fast-food outlets as a percentage of all food outlets, quartiles). Multivariable regression models estimated main effects and interactions (additive and multiplicative) of household income and fast-food outlet proportion on odds of self-reported frequent processed meat consumption (><U+2009>1/week), measured BMI (kg/m2), body fat (%), and odds of obesity (BMI<U+2009>=<U+2009>30).""",""" In a cohort of 51,361 adults aged 38–72 years in Greater London, UK, we jointly classified participants based on household income (£/year, four groups) and GIS-derived neighbourhood fast-food outlet proportion (counts of fast-food outlets as a percentage of all food outlets, quartiles).

Conclusions Our study demonstrated independent associations of neighbourhood fast-food outlet exposure and household income, in relation to diet and multiple objective measures of adiposity, in a large sample of UK adults.

According to the WHO’s Global Burden of Disease study, dietary risks and high body weight are two of the top three contributors to the number of years suffered with disability and morbidity in the UK [1]. Food-related ill health in the UK, driven by unhealthy diet, contributes to 10% of the combined mortality and morbidity burden [2]. Processed meat consumption, in particular, is associated with higher incidence of type-2 diabetes, coronary heart disease [3,4,5], and certain cancers [6].  Social inequalities in diet and obesity are established across markers of socioeconomic position (SEP) such as education, income (including household income [7]) and occupation [8], and may be contributing to recognised inequalities in NCD risk [9, 10]. Explanations include having less knowledge about healthy eating and fewer cooking skills [11, 12], and less time for cooking at home among socially disadvantaged groups [13]. Low-income groups, in particular, are also more price-sensitive [14], spending less on food overall and per calorie than other social groups [15].  In addition to individual-level socioeconomic determinants, neighbourhood food environments are also potentially important influences on diet and weight [16, 17], although the research evidence remains equivocal [18, 19]. Neighbourhoods where the mix of food retailing is biased towards a high proportion of fast-food outlets may be especially influential [20,21,22] – where fast-food might be perceived as the easier choice and therefore used more, and where greater fast-food access is not simply a function of greater access to all types of food outlet [23]. As a result, recent studies have increasingly situated fast-food access within the wider context of overall neighbourhood food retailing through adopting relative as opposed to absolute measures of exposure [24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. Easier access to fast-food outlets may facilitate the consumption of energy dense, nutrient poor fast foods [31, 32], which have been linked prospectively to excess weight gain [33], and associated with other cardio-metabolic risk factors [34]. Despite some fast-food outlets selling ‘healthier’ foods than others, at a population level, visits to and use of fast-food outlets has been linked to weight gain over time [35], and consumption of a less healthy diet and greater odds of obesity [36], respectively.  Fast-food access may also contribute to established social inequalities in fast-food consumption and weight [37]. Deprived neighbourhoods have generally greater numbers of fast-food outlets [16, 38], and there is evidence that the influence of neighbourhood environments vary by educational attainment as a marker of SEP [39]. However, there has been little research on the interaction between fast-food access and household income, which may hold implications for diet and weight via different mechanisms. Low-income consumers, in particular, may be disproportionately affected by the presence of fast-food outlets [14], which serve large portions of energy-dense, calorific foods at low prices [40].  With mounting evidence of the adverse influence of fast-food outlets on health and the abundance of fast-food outlets in deprived areas, the proliferation of these outlets has become a public health concern. Policies are now in place in many regions of the UK to stem growth in this retail sector [41], while in the US, a moratorium was placed on the opening of new fast-food outlets in South Los Angeles, for example [42]. At the same time, more empirical research is needed to better understand the magnitude of influence of fast-food outlets on health and their contribution to social inequalities.""","""In addition to individual-level socioeconomic determinants, neighbourhood food environments are also potentially important influences on diet and weight [16, 17], although the research evidence remains equivocal [18, 19].""","Yes","Yes","""At the same time, more empirical research is needed to better understand the magnitude of influence of fast-food outlets on health and their contribution to social inequalities.""","""There has been little research on the interaction between fast-food access and household income, which may hold implications for diet and weight via different mechanisms.""","""Using a large sample from the UK Biobank, the aim of this study was to establish the independent and combined associations (including interactions) of each of neighbourhood fast-food access and household income, with processed meat consumption and multiple measures of adiposity.""","""Low-income consumers, in particular, may be disproportionately affected by the presence of fast-food outlets [14], which serve large portions of energy-dense, calorific foods at low prices [40]....Using a large sample from the UK Biobank, the aim of this study was to establish the independent and combined associations (including interactions) of each of neighbourhood fast-food access and household income, with processed meat consumption and multiple measures of adiposity.""","Yes","Yes","Methods on page 2","""UK Biobank is a cross-sectional, observational cohort study, which recruited 502,656 people between 2006 and 2010.

There is also strong evidence that low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness [5] and muscular strength [6,7,8,9] are associated with similar adverse health outcomes. It has been suggested that the associations of physical activity and sedentary behaviour with health outcomes are largely independent [1, 2, 10]. However, a recent meta-analysis indicated that the adverse effects of sitting time and television (TV) viewing on mortality were not observed in individuals with high levels of physical activity [10]. This observation indicates that the risks associated with sedentary behaviour are not ubiquitous, since individuals with low physical activity experience the greatest adverse effects. Using data from UK Biobank, which includes almost 500,000 participants with data on grip strength and over 60,000 participants with data on cardiorespiratory fitness, we recently reported that the adverse association of low levels of physical activity with mortality and CVD events are substantially stronger in individuals with low levels of grip strength and/or cardiorespiratory fitness. This impies that the benefits of physical activity may be greatest amongst individuals with lower levels of functional capacity, but relatively modest in those with already high levels of functional capacity, who were at low risk irrespective of physical activity levels [9]. This has implications for public health guidance, as it suggests that specifically targeting those with low fitness and strength to increase their physical activity levels may be an effective approach to reduce population risk [9].

Grip strength was assessed using a Jamar J00105 hydraulic hand dynamometer and the mean of three measurements for each hand were used. Grip strength was measured in kilograms. Fitness test data were introduced into UK Biobank from August 2009, so these data are available only in a subgroup of 74,836 participants. In these individuals, cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using a sub-maximal 6-min incremental ramp cycle ergometer test with workload calculated according to age, height, weight, resting heart rate and sex, and heart rate monitored via a four-lead electrocardiogram, as previously reported, with the aim of achieving a final work rate of 50% of predicted maximal power [9]. Tests were terminated if heart rate exceeded 75% of the age-predicted maximum. In individuals with systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 109 mmHg or who answered ‘yes’ or ‘unsure’ to the question ‘Has a doctor ever said that you have a heart condition and should only do physical activity recommended by a doctor’, the test protocol was modified to achieve a final work rate of 35% of predicted maximal power (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>8932). Fitness was not measured in individuals who were not able to walk or cycle unaided for 10 min, were pregnant or had high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure<U+2009>=180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure<U+2009>=110 mmHg) (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>358) or if the equipment failed (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>643). The work rate at maximal heart rate was estimated by extrapolating the pre-exercise heart rate (i.e. at work rate zero watts) and the heart rate and work rate at the end of the test to the age-predicted maximal heart rate (208 – 0.7 × age) [18] assuming a linear relationship [19]. The linear nature of the work rate vs heart rate relationship means that the estimated maximal work rate for an individual should be independent of the work rate achieved during the exercise test. Maximal oxygen uptake (i.e. at maximal heart rate) was estimated from the regression equation for the relationship between work rate and oxygen uptake (oxygen uptake (in ml.kg-<U+2009>1.min-<U+2009>1)<U+2009>=<U+2009>7<U+2009>+<U+2009>(10.8 × work rate (in watts))/body mass (in kilograms)) [20] and then expressed in terms of maximal MET (where 1 MET = 3.5 ml.kg-<U+2009>1.min-<U+2009>1).  Dietary information was collected via a self-reported dietary questionnaire (Oxford WebQ) [21, 22]. Participants were asked how many portions of specified foods they generally ate. Subjective sleep duration was obtained by asking: ‘About how many hours sleep do you get in every 24 hours?’ Based on the answer, we derived a categorical sleep duration variable (short sleeper <7 h.day-<U+2009>1, normal sleeper 7–9 h.day-<U+2009>1 or long sleeper >9 h.day-<U+2009>1). Area-based socioeconomic status was derived from postcode of residence using the Townsend score, which is derived from census data on housing, employment, social class and car availability [23]. Other socio-demographic information such as employment (paid employment, retired, unable to work, unemployed, student and other), professional qualifications (college or university, A or O levels, GCSE, CSEs or equivalent levels) and income (<£18,000, £18,000–29,999, £30,000–51,999, £52,000–100,000 and<U+2009>>£100,000) were self-reported at baseline. Age was calculated from dates of birth and baseline assessment. Ethnicity was self-reported and smoking status was categorised into never, former and current smoking. Medical history (physician diagnosis of long-standing illness, depression, stroke, angina, myocardial infarction, hypertension, cancer and diabetes) and medication history (for diabetes, cholesterol and hypertension) were collected from the self-completed baseline assessment questionnaire. Height, body weight and waist circumference were measured by trained nurses during the baseline assessment. Body composition (percentage body fat) was measured using standardised bio-impedance protocols. BMI was calculated as (weight/height2) and the World Health Organization criteria [24] were used to classify BMI into underweight <18.5, normal weight 18.5–24.9, overweight 25.0–29.9 and obese =30.0 kg.m-<U+2009>2. Central obesity was defined as waist circumference<U+2009>>88 cm for women and<U+2009>>102 cm for men.

Data were analysed in accordance with the IPAQ scoring protocol [17] and total physical activity was computed as the sum of walking and moderate and vigorous activity, measured as metabolic equivalent (MET, hours/week). Participants were excluded from the analyses if they recorded implausible values, that is, if the sum of their total physical activity, sleeping time and total screen time exceeded 24 h (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>705 participants were excluded) [9].  Grip strength was assessed using a Jamar J00105 hydraulic hand dynamometer and the mean of three measurements for each hand were used. Grip strength was measured in kilograms. Fitness test data were introduced into UK Biobank from August 2009, so these data are available only in a subgroup of 74,836 participants. In these individuals, cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using a sub-maximal 6-min incremental ramp cycle ergometer test with workload calculated according to age, height, weight, resting heart rate and sex, and heart rate monitored via a four-lead electrocardiogram, as previously reported, with the aim of achieving a final work rate of 50% of predicted maximal power [9]. Tests were terminated if heart rate exceeded 75% of the age-predicted maximum. In individuals with systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 109 mmHg or who answered ‘yes’ or ‘unsure’ to the question ‘Has a doctor ever said that you have a heart condition and should only do physical activity recommended by a doctor’, the test protocol was modified to achieve a final work rate of 35% of predicted maximal power (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>8932). Fitness was not measured in individuals who were not able to walk or cycle unaided for 10 min, were pregnant or had high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure<U+2009>=180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure<U+2009>=110 mmHg) (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>358) or if the equipment failed (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>643). The work rate at maximal heart rate was estimated by extrapolating the pre-exercise heart rate (i.e. at work rate zero watts) and the heart rate and work rate at the end of the test to the age-predicted maximal heart rate (208 – 0.7 × age) [18] assuming a linear relationship [19]. The linear nature of the work rate vs heart rate relationship means that the estimated maximal work rate for an individual should be independent of the work rate achieved during the exercise test. Maximal oxygen uptake (i.e. at maximal heart rate) was estimated from the regression equation for the relationship between work rate and oxygen uptake (oxygen uptake (in ml.kg-<U+2009>1.min-<U+2009>1)<U+2009>=<U+2009>7<U+2009>+<U+2009>(10.8 × work rate (in watts))/body mass (in kilograms)) [20] and then expressed in terms of maximal MET (where 1 MET = 3.5 ml.kg-<U+2009>1.min-<U+2009>1).  Dietary information was collected via a self-reported dietary questionnaire (Oxford WebQ) [21, 22]. Participants were asked how many portions of specified foods they generally ate. Subjective sleep duration was obtained by asking: ‘About how many hours sleep do you get in every 24 hours?’ Based on the answer, we derived a categorical sleep duration variable (short sleeper <7 h.day-<U+2009>1, normal sleeper 7–9 h.day-<U+2009>1 or long sleeper >9 h.day-<U+2009>1). Area-based socioeconomic status was derived from postcode of residence using the Townsend score, which is derived from census data on housing, employment, social class and car availability [23]. Other socio-demographic information such as employment (paid employment, retired, unable to work, unemployed, student and other), professional qualifications (college or university, A or O levels, GCSE, CSEs or equivalent levels) and income (<£18,000, £18,000–29,999, £30,000–51,999, £52,000–100,000 and<U+2009>>£100,000) were self-reported at baseline. Age was calculated from dates of birth and baseline assessment. Ethnicity was self-reported and smoking status was categorised into never, former and current smoking. Medical history (physician diagnosis of long-standing illness, depression, stroke, angina, myocardial infarction, hypertension, cancer and diabetes) and medication history (for diabetes, cholesterol and hypertension) were collected from the self-completed baseline assessment questionnaire. Height, body weight and waist circumference were measured by trained nurses during the baseline assessment. Body composition (percentage body fat) was measured using standardised bio-impedance protocols. BMI was calculated as (weight/height2) and the World Health Organization criteria [24] were used to classify BMI into underweight <18.5, normal weight 18.5–24.9, overweight 25.0–29.9 and obese =30.0 kg.m-<U+2009>2. Central obesity was defined as waist circumference<U+2009>>88 cm for women and<U+2009>>102 cm for men.

It might be expected that such individuals would be more likely to have a low rather than high level of fitness, thus their inclusion could conceivably have obscured or augmented the true association between fitness and the outcome measures due to reverse causality. UK Biobank is relatively representative of the general population with respect to age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation within the age range recruited but is not representative in other regards, such as prevalence of obesity and comorbidities, which may indicate a healthy volunteer selection bias [37]. Whilst this limits the ability to generalise prevalence rates, estimates of the magnitude of associations regarding disease or mortality and disease risk in the current study should nevertheless be generalisable [13, 37, 38]. As is the case for any observational study, causality cannot be confirmed and reverse causality is always a possibility. However, our analyses were conducted by excluding all those with chronic conditions. Although disease and comorbidities existing before the UK Biobank measurement day were self-reported, these self-reported records were based on diseases that have been medically diagnosed. Additionally, we excluded those who died within the first 2 years of follow-up. These approaches help us to minimise the risk of reverse causality influencing our estimates.

Although physical activity was measured by self-report using a validated questionnaire [9, 17, 39], self-reported screen time has not been examined for criterion validity. However, most self-reported instruments have similar validity [40], and the effect estimates reported for screen time in this study were similar to those reported previously in comparable populations using similar adjustment strategies [3, 4, 41]. Misreporting of screen time or physical activity may have attenuated the association between the lifestyle exposures and mortality compared to an objective physical activity measurement [42]. However, this is unlikely to have substantially confounded the differential influence of the exposures on mortality and disease risk across the screen-time or physical activity groups, unless the extent of misreporting of screen time was systematically greater in the groups with the highest levels of physical activity, fitness and grip strength. It is also more feasible to administer a questionnaire rather than an objective measure as a screening tool in routine clinical or community settings [26] to identify individuals for whom increasing physical activity and reducing screen time would be particularly beneficial. The present data suggest that this self-report approach is sufficiently robust to identify differential levels of risk.

However, most self-reported instruments have similar validity [40], and the effect estimates reported for screen time in this study were similar to those reported previously in comparable populations using similar adjustment strategies [3, 4, 41]. Misreporting of screen time or physical activity may have attenuated the association between the lifestyle exposures and mortality compared to an objective physical activity measurement [42]. However, this is unlikely to have substantially confounded the differential influence of the exposures on mortality and disease risk across the screen-time or physical activity groups, unless the extent of misreporting of screen time was systematically greater in the groups with the highest levels of physical activity, fitness and grip strength. It is also more feasible to administer a questionnaire rather than an objective measure as a screening tool in routine clinical or community settings [26] to identify individuals for whom increasing physical activity and reducing screen time would be particularly beneficial. The present data suggest that this self-report approach is sufficiently robust to identify differential levels of risk. Although our analyses were adjusted for a number of major confounding factors, we cannot fully discard the potential contribution of unmeasured confounding factors or other proxies of sedentary leisure behaviour in our findings.""",,"""In conclusion, the present data build on existing evidence that a high level of discretionary screen time is a potentially preventable contributor to morbidity and mortality, by demonstrating that this relationship is substantially attenuated by grip strength and cardiorespiratory fitness. We also confirm and extend recent observations that the association between TV viewing and mortality is attenuated by a level of physical activity. This has two potentially important implications for public health. First, interventions to reduce discretionary sedentary behaviours to improve future health outcomes may be more economically and clinically effective if they are targeted at those with low levels of strength, fitness and physical activity. Second, increasing strength and fitness may provide a means of offsetting the potential adverse consequences of high screen time. Both of these warrant testing in future randomised controlled trials.""","""If these associations are causal, this suggests that the population subgroups with the lowest levels of strength, fitness and physical activity could potentially obtain the greatest benefit from interventions aimed at reducing sedentary behaviours""","Yes","Yes","""UK Biobank is relatively representative of the general population with respect to age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation within the age range recruited but is not representative in other regards, such as prevalence of obesity and comorbidities, which may indicate a healthy volunteer selection bias [37].

Up to 600 million people are affected worldwide and COPD is one of the leading causes of mortality.1 COPD is characterized by progressive and largely irreversible airflow limitation resulting in dyspnea. Extrapulmonary features such as fatigue, osteoporosis, cardiac failure, and depression are highly prevalent.2  Patients with COPD can have cognitive impairments, either globally or in single cognitive domains.3 Reported incidence ranges from 12% to 88%.4 Cognitive impairment may be associated with the degree of lung function impairment in patients with COPD5 and has been found to predict mortality in hypoxemic COPD.6 Moreover, cognitive impairment may lead to increased dyspnea and fatigue7 and result in incorrect use of inhaler devices and low compliance with medical treatment as has previously been shown in elderly subjects.8 This might increase the exacerbation risk and could result in worse health outcome.9 To date it remains unknown which domains of cognitive functioning are affected in community-based patients with COPD.10  Insight in cognitive functioning is of great importance to optimize self-management programs for patients with COPD. Indeed, for a patient with COPD, it is important to comply with guidelines for a healthier life style (eg, quit smoking, correct use of medication, and become physically active). Executive functions are evoked for adequate self-management.11 The domain executive functioning is a multifaceted neuropsychological construct, consisting of a set of higher-order neurocognitive processes that contribute to purposeful, goal-directed, and future-oriented behavioral skills, such as organization, planning, problem solving, and reasoning.12 Patients with executive function deficits have difficulties in managing their disease.11 Consequently, cognitive impairments in COPD patients may negatively affect their treatment and in particular the impact of self-management programs.""","""Patients with COPD can have cognitive impairments, either glob-ally or in single cognitive domains.

""","Yes","Yes","""Introduction Outdoor air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and ground-level ozone (O3) are associated with acute and chronic illnesses including cancer, asthma, stroke, heart disease and diabetes1. Possible links with cognitive decline have received research attention over the past decade, summarised in five recent systematic reviews2,3,4,5,6. Although confounding background factors such as deprivation and education may partially account for observed associations with cognitive outcomes, it has been postulated that exposure to air pollution has a causal influence via harmful effects on the brain. There is evidence from animal and human studies that air pollutants are linked to inflammatory processes and morphological changes in the brain, such as upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin-1 alpha and beta, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha), activation of microglia and reactive oxygen species, alpha-synuclein deposition, and decreases in dendritic spine density and branching in the hippocampus7,8,9,10,11. These may result from infiltration of pollutants such as ultrafine particulate matter into brain tissue, via the olfactory nerve or the blood-brain barrier11,12, with possible contributions through pulmonary inflammation and downstream effects on systemic circulation13. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality are elevated in association with air pollution exposure14,15,16, and neuroimaging studies have shown associations with atrophy, infarcts, white matter hyperintensities and altered cerebrovascular haemodynamics17,18.  Associations of generally small effect size have been reported in cross-sectional studies of air pollution exposure and cognitive test performance19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26, although others have reported primarily null results27,28. Inconsistent small or null effects have also been shown in studies of cognitive score change over intervals of two to five years29,30,31. A smaller number of studies have examined associations with clinical cognitive disorders. In cross-sectional and case-control studies, air pollutant exposure has been linked with greater odds of global and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI)32 and Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia33. Cohort studies investigating dementia incidence over follow-up periods of up to 15 years have reported greater hazard ratios associated with air pollutant exposure34,35,36 and proximity to major roads37. Heterogeneity of study populations, measures and statistical adjustment methods means that none of the five systematic reviews published to date has included a meta-analysis of effect size estimates. Considerable uncertainty therefore remains regarding the likely magnitude of any association.  Large study samples are needed for the reliable detection of associations of small effect size. Cross-sectional studies investigating the relationship between air pollution exposure and performance on cognitive tests have used samples ranging from n<U+2009>=<U+2009>39922 to n<U+2009>=<U+2009>15,97326, and longitudinal studies of cognitive score change have ranged from n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2,86730 to n<U+2009>=<U+2009>20,15029. The inconsistent findings and imprecision of the effect size estimates from these studies may indicate the need for samples which are larger still. Previous studies have also varied considerably in the air pollutant exposures that have been measured—most frequently particulate matter, with gas pollutants studied less often—and in the outcomes investigated, encompassing a range of different cognitive assessments or dementia diagnoses. Furthermore, the type and number of possible confounding variables adjusted in statistical analyses have varied widely: most studies have adjusted for sociodemographic factors (including age, gender, ethnicity, education and socioeconomic status), and some have taken account of lifestyle factors such as smoking and physical activity. No study to date has examined the influence of time spent outdoors, despite the fact that the pollution measures predominantly capture neighbourhood air quality rather than individual-level exposure; it might be expected that the magnitude of the relationship between neighbourhood pollution measures and cognitive outcomes would be greater among those who spend more time outdoors.""","""Outdoor air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and ground-level ozone (O3) are associated with acute and chronic illnesses including cancer, asthma, stroke, heart disease and diabetes.

Higher values indicate better performance on the reasoning and numeric memory tests, and worse performance on the reaction time and pairs matching tests. Prospective memory test performance was categorised dichotomously as 1 for a correct response on the first attempt and 0 otherwise. Details of all tests are provided in the Supplementary Methods. The numeric memory test was removed from the UK Biobank baseline assessment battery part-way through recruitment, for reasons of time, resulting in lower sample sizes on this test than on the other four tests.  Change on the cognitive tests was measured by subtracting the baseline score from the follow-up score. Raw scores were used in these calculations, without any replacement of outlying values.

Where a pollutant measure was available for more than one year, data for the earliest available year were analysed, to minimise uncertainty about the temporal order of exposure and outcome. The PM10 measure was for 2007; PM2.5 to 10 and PM2.5 were for 2010; NO2 was for 2005; and NOx was for 2010.  Defra air pollution data: The UK Biobank air pollution data described above were mapped to participants’ baseline addresses, without taking account of address history at the time the pollutant measure was recorded. Separate data were made available subsequently by UK Biobank regarding participants’ past address history (east and north coordinates rounded to 1<U+2009>km), and the date the participant was first recorded at each location. These were used in the present study to map air pollution data provided by the UK Government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) (https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data). Modelled data47 for the same pollutants in the same years as above (PM10 for 2007; PM2.5 to 10 and PM2.5 for 2010; NO2 for 2005; and NOx for 2010) were mapped to participants’ addresses in the relevant year. These data were used only in sensitivity analyses, described below.  Other local environment measures Population density (urban/rural) was classified categorically by UK Biobank, by combining each participant’s baseline residential postcode with data generated from the 2001 census, using the GeoConvert tool provided by the UK Data Service Census Support (http://geoconvert.mimas.ac.uk/). Road traffic measures were provided for the year 2008 from the Road Traffic Statistics Branch at the Department for Transport attached to the local road network; traffic data for unmonitored links were estimates based on surrounding monitored links. A major road was defined as a road with traffic intensity >5000 motor vehicles per 24<U+2009>hours. Traffic intensity on the nearest major road was measured as the average total number of motor vehicles per 24<U+2009>hours. Proximity to the nearest major road was calculated as the inverse distance (1/m) from the residential location. Data were also available regarding noise pollution, and these were included in supplementary analyses to address potential residual confounding (see Data analysis section below). Noise estimates for the year 2009 were modelled using a version of the Common NOise aSSessment methOdS (CNOSSOS-EU) noise model48,49; average level of noise pollution in decibels was calculated as a weighted level measured over a 24-hour period, with a 10 decibel penalty added between 23:00<U+2009>h and 07:00<U+2009>h.  Sociodemographic and lifestyle measures Age was recorded in whole years. Gender was self-reported as male or female. Self-reported ethnic background was grouped categorically as white, Asian/Asian British, black/black British, Chinese, or mixed/other ethnic group. Neighbourhood-level socioeconomic status was measured using the Townsend index of material deprivation50. This was calculated by UK Biobank immediately before the baseline date, based on census data regarding unemployment, car ownership, home ownership and household overcrowding; each participant was assigned a score corresponding to the census output area in which their residential postcode was located, with higher values indicating greater relative deprivation (see Supplementary Methods). Educational qualifications were self-reported, and for the present study were dichotomised according to whether or not participants held a university/college degree. Self-reported smoking status data were used by UK Biobank to categorise participants as current, former or never smokers; these were dichotomised for the present study as ‘ever smoker’ (current or former) versus ‘never smoker’. Physical activity in a typical week was recorded using self-reported items from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form51, and was converted into a single measure of total physical activity in metabolic equivalent of task (MET) hours per week, weighted by intensity (walking, moderate or vigorous). Participants were asked to estimate how many hours they spent outdoors in a typical day in summer, and in a typical day in winter. Responses were given in whole hours from 0 to 24, and participants whose responses exceeded 10 were asked to check and confirm this. An additional option of ‘Less than an hour a day’ was available, and for the present study was assigned a value of 0.5. Overall time outdoors was calculated as the mean of the hours per day in summer and winter together.  Cognitive assessment The format and psychometric properties of the cognitive tests used in UK Biobank have been described by us previously39,52. All tests were administered visually via touchscreen, and scoring was automated. The tasks assessed reasoning (total correct of 13 items), reaction time (mean time in milliseconds to press a button in response to matching cards), numeric memory (longest numeric string recalled in reverse), visuospatial memory (‘pairs matching’ test: total errors when recalling positions of matching cards) and prospective memory (successfully carrying out an instruction after a filled delay). Higher values indicate better performance on the reasoning and numeric memory tests, and worse performance on the reaction time and pairs matching tests. Prospective memory test performance was categorised dichotomously as 1 for a correct response on the first attempt and 0 otherwise. Details of all tests are provided in the Supplementary Methods. The numeric memory test was removed from the UK Biobank baseline assessment battery part-way through recruitment, for reasons of time, resulting in lower sample sizes on this test than on the other four tests.  Change on the cognitive tests was measured by subtracting the baseline score from the follow-up score. Raw scores were used in these calculations, without any replacement of outlying values. Negative change score values on the reasoning test indicate worse performance at follow-up; positive change score values on the reaction time test indicate slower performance at follow-up; positive change score values on the pairs matching test indicate more errors at follow-up. Change on the prospective memory test was dichotomised as ‘worse at follow-up’<U+2009>=<U+2009>1, versus ‘same or better at follow-up’<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 (i.e., ‘worse at follow-up’ means the participant gave the correct response at baseline and an incorrect response at follow-up).

Air pollution measures UK Biobank air pollution data: Air pollution and local environment measures were provided by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (http://www.sahsu.org/) as part of the BioSHaRE-EU Environmental Determinants of Health Project (http://www.bioshare.eu/), and were linked centrally to the assessment data by UK Biobank analysts (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/EnviroExposEst.pdf). These measures were modelled at participants’ baseline residential addresses. A total of 7,221 addresses (approximately 1.4%) could not be geo-coded and therefore have missing data. Particulate matter of up to 10<U+2009>µm diameter (PM10, PM2.5 to 10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and total nitrogen oxides (NOx) were measured as annual average values in µg/m3. Estimates for the years 2005 to 2007 were derived from European Union (EU)-wide air pollution maps (resolution 100<U+2009>m × 100<U+2009>m). The X, Y coordinates of participants’ baseline addresses were overlaid on these maps (projected to the British National Grid) and the corresponding air pollution concentration of the 100<U+2009>m × 100<U+2009>m grid cell was assigned to the coordinate.

Data were summarised descriptively to characterise the baseline and follow-up samples. Quintiles were derived for the measures of major road proximity, traffic intensity, noise pollution, physical activity and time outdoors, based on all available data in the whole UK Biobank cohort at baseline. Regression models were used to estimate the association between air pollution exposures (independent variable) and cognitive performance (dependent variable), with and without adjustment for other covariates. The pollutant data provided centrally by UK Biobank were used in all primary analyses, and sensitivity analyses were conducted using the Defra data (see below). Multicollinearity between the air pollution measures and the covariates was within acceptable limits (variance inflation factor values 1.77 to 1.96). For all models, normal-approximation 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated from bootstrapped standard errors (5000 replicates)54. Since there were 25 cross-sectional and 20 follow-up regression analyses, p values (two-tailed) for the pollutant coefficients were adjusted using the Simes-Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method55; both unadjusted and FDR-adjusted p values are reported. Alpha was 0.05 (FDR-adjusted). ‘Do not know’ and ‘Prefer not to answer’ responses were treated as missing. Missing data were not imputed.  For the cross-sectional analyses, each baseline cognitive measure was regressed separately on each air pollution measure (continuous), firstly in unadjusted models and then with adjustment for baseline age, gender, ethnic group, Townsend score (continuous), education, smoking status, physical activity (quintiles), time outdoors (quintiles), major road proximity (quintiles), traffic intensity (quintiles), and population density category. The Supplementary Methods shows a directed acyclic graph of the assumptions underpinning the analytical model: the aim of covariate adjustment was to minimise confounding influences on the association between air pollution exposure and cognitive performance, rather than to construct a multivariable risk prediction model for cognitive outcome. Linear regression was used for the reasoning and numeric memory scores, which were approximately normally distributed, and unstandardized coefficients are reported. Positive skew in the reaction time distribution was addressed using a natural log transformation, and linear regression was then used; exponentiated results are reported as rate ratios (RR).

The assumptions underpinning the analytical model were depicted in a directed acyclic graph, and DAGitty software 2 was used to derive an appropriate covariate adjustment set. DAGitty uses an algorithm to determine whether adjusting for certain covariates will block confounding paths in the graph, based on the directional relationships that are depicted between the nodes in the graph. The algorithm uses the rules of ‘d-separation’ 3 ; it is based solely on the structure of the graph, not on any measured data. Supplementary Figure S1a below shows the variables (nodes) and their putative inter-relationships (arrows) that are assumed to give rise to the predicted association between neighbourhood air pollution exposure and cognitive performance; paths representing potential confounding influences are shown in red. Given these assumptions, the DAGitty algorithm determined a minimum sufficient adjustment set to block these confounding paths (Supplementary Figure S1b; blocked confounding paths shown in black). Ethnic group was not part of the minimum adjustment set, but was included as a covariate in the main analyses in this study because of its inclusion in other key studies in the literature; adding this to the adjustment set did not re-introduce bias according to the graph assumptions (Supplementary Figure S1c: main analysis model). Noise pollution was also added to the covariate adjustment set in supplementary analyses: although the graph structure indicated that confounding paths that included noise pollution should already be blocked following adjustment for deprivation, population density, road proximity, traffic intensity and time outdoors (Supplementary Figure S1c), the addition of noise pollution to the covariate adjustment set (Supplementary Figure S1d) may reduce additional residual confounding. Note that the relationships depicted in the graph are cross-sectional and therefore static, and they do not illustrate the complex time-dependent effects that may be at play. For example, current general health status was assumed in the graph to affect time outdoors and thereby pollution exposure, but pollution exposure (and its antecedents) in the more distant past are likely to have affected general health status over time. Similarly, in some circumstances air pollution levels influence the amount of time that people choose to spend outdoors, and reversing this arrow in the graph would alter the implications for covariate adjustment.

In common with most previous studies in this field, individual-level pollutant measures were not available, but efforts were made to mitigate this by analysing data regarding time spent outdoors (albeit that this measure was self-reported and did not necessarily represent time spent outdoors in the neighbourhood of residence from which the pollution measures were taken). The air pollution measures were also taken from different years, up to five years prior to cognitive assessment. The cognitive tests were brief and were subject to measurement error; the previously-noted low reliability of some of the tests (e.g. pairs matching test-retest correlation <0.2)39 is likely to have biased the change score analyses towards the null, particularly in the relatively short follow-up duration studied here. It is possible to conduct joint analyses of the cognitive outcome measures using latent factors or multivariate modelling (e.g. canonical correlation analysis), which would address the problem of low reliability of individual measures, but this would also reduce the ability to detect any domain-specific relationships that may exist, e.g. affecting memory tasks only. The temporal order of some of the measures was unclear: despite the restrictions imposed on the timing of the pollution measures relative to the date of the baseline cognitive assessment, it was not possible to tell when participants’ cognitive performance reached the level at which it was measured at baseline, because no premorbid cognitive estimates were available. It is therefore possible that cognitive decline had occurred prior to the study period, which in turn may or may not have been causally linked to air pollution exposure at an earlier age.

There was some indication that those having surgery were less likely to be in the lowest or highest category of educational qualification or accommodation tenure.  Frequency of Other Self-Reported Ocular Conditions Of note, the frequency of other self-reported eye conditions was higher in the group reporting laser refractive surgery (27.5%) than in those with refractive error but no surgery (11.4%) and those without refractive error (8.1%) (Table 5). Specifically, cataract was reported by 8.9%, ocular trauma by 1.7%, retinal detachment by 2.1%, diabetic eye disease by 3.3%, and glaucoma by 2.5% of those who reported having laser refractive surgery. Because these were cross-sectional data, it was not possible to determine whether these additional ocular disorders occurred before or after refractive surgery.Distribution and Frequency of General Health and Happiness and Social Activity Outcomes There were no consistent differences found in report of general health, happiness, or visits from/to friends between the 2 groups in either distribution or frequency of laser eye surgery (Table 3, Table 6). There were significant differences in the distribution of those reporting social and physical activities. Of those who reported attending a sports/gym club in the preceding month, 39.1% reported treatment versus 28.9% who did not; of those going to a pub or social club, 28.2% reported treatment versus 24.0% who did not; of those attending a religious group, 10.7% reported treatment versus 17.1% who did not; and of those attending other group activities, 19.3% reported treatment versus 23.2% who did not (Table 6).

In the 2011 census, of the 58% of adults who responded to the question ‘how do you usually travel to work? 67% reported private motorised transport as the principal mode of transport, 17.8% public transport, 10.9% walking and 3.1% commuting by bicycle.15  There is increasing evidence of an association between AC and measures of obesity.16 17 In the UK Understanding Society cohort, AC has been shown to be predictive of lower body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage, and a lower adjusted odds of reporting a diabetes diagnosis compared with car users.16 18 Similarly in UK Biobank, AC was significantly and independently associated with lower BMI and body fat percentage.17 The protective effect of AC is likely to be mediated through increased PA, as demonstrated in a UK study that used accelerometry and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to show that walking to work contributed 47.3% of daily MVPA.19  Causal evidence from longitudinal or experimental studies is rare. A longitudinal analysis of the UK Biobank cohort looked at changes in BMI in response to changes in commuting mode over a 4-year follow-up. Individuals who transitioned from car commuting at baseline to active or public transportation modes at follow-up had a decrease in BMI of -0.30<U+2009>kg/m2 (95%<U+2009>CI -0.47 to –0.13).20  Promoting AC may help to increase population levels of activity; however, there is a need to understand the correlates of AC to develop appropriate interventions. Some key determinants of commuter cycling and walking behaviour have been identified as high population density, dedicated cycling paths, short trip distances and good traffic and road conditions, such as the presence of traffic calming measures.21 22 Most work to date has been performed in healthy adults, and there is a need to understand how these findings relate to populations with T2DM who are characterised by obesity and physical inactivity.""","""The role of active commuting (AC) in increasing PA and controlling excessive weight gain has been recognised and endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

AC was reported by 5.5% of the sample, of whom less than 1% reported cycling. AC was strongly and consistently associated with higher PA, whether expressed as MVPA or total MET-min/week. In fully adjusted models, AC was associated with an additional 73<U+2009>min/week of MVPA for men and 105<U+2009>min/week of MVPA for women, making a substantial contribution to meeting the UK Government recommended levels of 150<U+2009>min/week MVPA.7 This finding supports previous work by Audrey et al, 19 which found levels of PA to be higher in those who walked to work compared with those who did not. Furthermore the association with MVPA seen in the present study is substantially larger than achieved in a similar population undergoing an intensive PA intervention,8 suggesting that adoption of AC could be an effective intervention for people with T2D.  The importance of sedentary time for both prevention and management of type 2 diabetes has gained research prominence in recent years,31 32 and we found a substantial association between AC and lower sedentary time. In both sexes both AC and public and mixed modes of transport were associated with over an hour less sedentary time per day compared with car use. Since adults with T2DM typically spend less than 3% of the day engaged in MVPA, interventions that focus on reducing sedentary time may be more effective to improve health33; reallocating 30<U+2009>min of prolonged sedentary time to more active pursuits can improve body composition and cholesterol levels in adults with T2DM.34  The predominant correlate of AC was distance to work, with few people who lived over 1.5 miles from their workplace choosing AC and those living in rural areas less likely to actively commute. Although distance from home to work is not modifiable, AC as the whole or part of the journey could be encouraged by providing more cycleways, by road safety measures to limit traffic speed and improving access to parks and green spaces.35 36 We were unable to examine the association of access to transport as a correlate of AC, but it can be hypothesised this would correlate strongly with the transport method chosen. Furthermore, we used a crude measure of AC (walking or cycling only) and were therefore unable to explore the role of AC as a contributor to the overall journey. Individuals who live beyond 3–6 miles from work are unlikely to solely use AC modes to travel to work and are more likely to combine AC with another form of activity, such as the car or public transport. Therefore the role of AC as a component of the overall journey should be explored in future research.  In the current study, the results for public transport were equivocal with no apparent observations with PA observed. This contrasts with previous research17 and may be due to an inability to differentiate between the different types of public transport taken and the public transport category also including people who reported mixed modes of motorised travel and AC. There are likely to be variations in the energy requirements of different transport modes, which should be examined. It could also be hypothesised that walking or activity behaviours associated with public transport are difficult to recall and record in the IPAQ. However, in previous research public transport has been shown to contribute to PA and therefore warrants further investigation.  The final aim of the study was to explore the social and environmental correlates of AC behaviour. Those who lived in a rural area were less likely to use active modes of commuting, but no other environmental variables, such as traffic density, were shown to be associated. This may be due to an overall lack of variation in the environmental variables and suggests a more diverse sample may be required. For example, there is a lack of interindividual variation in the measure of air pollution, which may explain the lack of association seen""","""A substantial majority (80%) of adults with T2DM reported commuting by car.

We investigated predictors of mortality in UK Biobank participants during a 5 year period. We aimed to investigate the associations between most of the available measurements and 5 year all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and to develop and validate a prediction score for 5 year mortality using only self-reported information.  Methods Participants were enrolled in the UK Biobank from April, 2007, to July, 2010, from 21 assessment centres across England, Wales, and Scotland with standardised procedures. In this prospective population-based study, we assessed sex-specific associations of 655 measurements of demographics, health, and lifestyle with all-cause mortality and six cause-specific mortality categories in UK Biobank participants using the Cox proportional hazard model. We excluded variables that were missing in more than 80% of the participants and all cardiorespiratory fitness test measurements because summary data were not available. Validation of the prediction score was done in participants enrolled at the Scottish centres. UK life tables and census information were used to calibrate the score to the overall UK population.""",,"Yes",,"""Findings About 500<U+2008>000 participants were included in the UK Biobank.

Self-reported health (C-index including age 0·74 [95% CI 0·73–0·75]) was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in men and a previous cancer diagnosis (0·73 [0·72–0·74]) was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in women. When excluding individuals with major diseases or disorders (Charlson comorbidity index >0; n=355 043), measures of smoking habits were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality. The prognostic score including 13 self-reported predictors for men and 11 for women achieved good discrimination (0·80 [0·77–0·83] for men and 0·79 [0·76–0·83] for women) and significantly outperformed the Charlson comorbidity index (p<0·0001 in men and p=0·0007 in women). A dedicated website allows the interactive exploration of all results along with calculation of individual risk through an online questionnaire.  Interpretation Measures that can simply be obtained by questionnaires and without physical examination were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality in the UK Biobank population.

Moreover, these risk factors can be combined into a prognostic index to provide information about individual mortality risk or other health-related measures. Traditionally, association with mortality has been studied for one risk factor at a time,2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and the few studies that have investigated more than one risk factor did not assess different causes of death and based their analyses on small study samples.7 Several prognostic indices for short-term mortality exist, but they have mainly been developed for and assessed in older individuals or in high-risk populations.8, 9 Furthermore, the small sample sizes and the small number of risk factors investigated are the main limitations of all previous studies.""",,"Yes",,"""The UK Biobank project10 includes about 500<U+2008>000 men and women aged 40–70 years.

Self-reported health and walking pace were the strongest predictors in both sexes and across different causes of deaths.

In view of the large number of statistical tests done, approaches to take multiple testing into account should be considered when interpreting the significance of the reported associations. The UK Biobank had a response rate of about 5·5%. Even if the distribution of measurements in the UK Biobank is different from the general population, the generalisability of the associations is guaranteed as long as sufficient heterogeneity across measurements exists, as previously discussed.33,  34 For example, in men, the hazard ratio for association between poor or fair versus excellent or good self-reported health was 2·8 (95% CI 2·7–3·0), which is similar to what was observed in a large survey sample from the USA (OR [odds ratio] 3·2 [3·1–3·3]) in white participants), which has been designed to be representative of the US population aged 18 years or older.4 Nevertheless, response bias might have affected the generalisability of the observed associations and to a lesser extent (because of the multivariable nature of the model) that of the prediction score. Moreover, self-reported variables are always subject to misclassification bias and this aspect should be considered when interpreting the results from the association analyses. Generally, mortality data from death certificates are subject to inaccurate reporting with misclassification of death causes.35 In the UK, routine checks are done by the Office for National Statistics to increase the quality of mortality data36 and validation studies cross-referencing outcomes across death, cancer, primary, and secondary care datasets are continuing in the UK Biobank.

Even if the distribution of measurements in the UK Biobank is different from the general population, the generalisability of the associations is guaranteed as long as sufficient heterogeneity across measurements exists, as previously discussed.33,  34 For example, in men, the hazard ratio for association between poor or fair versus excellent or good self-reported health was 2·8 (95% CI 2·7–3·0), which is similar to what was observed in a large survey sample from the USA (OR [odds ratio] 3·2 [3·1–3·3]) in white participants), which has been designed to be representative of the US population aged 18 years or older.4 Nevertheless, response bias might have affected the generalisability of the observed associations and to a lesser extent (because of the multivariable nature of the model) that of the prediction score. Moreover, self-reported variables are always subject to misclassification bias and this aspect should be considered when interpreting the results from the association analyses. Generally, mortality data from death certificates are subject to inaccurate reporting with misclassification of death causes.35 In the UK, routine checks are done by the Office for National Statistics to increase the quality of mortality data36 and validation studies cross-referencing outcomes across death, cancer, primary, and secondary care datasets are continuing in the UK Biobank. According to a large study in Finland,37 the largest misclassification is expected between deaths from diseases of the circulatory system and diseases of the respiratory system.""",,"""In summary, we present an untargeted, large-scale examination of all-cause and cause-specific mortality predictors in middle-aged to elderly individuals.

Second, the distribution of the risk factors and the mortality rates should be similar to those in the UK as a whole.

Poor muscular strength, another component of fitness, has also been indicated as an important marker of mortality [6, 7] as well as adverse health outcomes such as frailty and sarcopenia [8]. Recent clinical trials [9,10,11,12] have demonstrated that compared with improving either CRF or muscle strength alone, improving both CRF and muscle strength simultaneously led to more favorable changes on intermediate cardio-metabolic risk factors and functional status; these intermediate outcomes are important predictors for clinical end-points [13, 14]. However, the prior clinical trials [9,10,11,12] did not include clinical end-points, and it would, in fact, be nearly impossible to establish clinical trials with sufficient statistical power to do so. In contrast, large-scale prospective observational studies can provide such evidence. However, a few observational studies evaluating combined impacts of CRF and muscle strength in relation to mortality risk merely included data from highly select populations of men (i.e. men who were either hypertensive [15] or adolescent [16] at baseline). This limitation precludes the ability to draw robust conclusions for general adult populations of men and women. Given that current public health guidelines [17] recommend that men and women engage in both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities across the whole lifespan, it is critical from clinical and public health standpoints to examine the combined impacts of CRF and muscle strength for mortality risk for a broader adult population.""",""" Recent clinical trials [9–12] have demonstrated that compared with improving either CRF or muscle strength alone, improving both CRF and muscle strength simultaneously led to more favorable changes on intermediate cardio-metabolic risk factors and functional status; these intermediate outcomes are important predictors for clinical end-points""","Yes","Yes","""However, a few observational studies evaluating combined impacts of CRF and muscle strength in relation to mortality risk merely included data from highly select populations of men (i.e. men who were either hypertensive [15] or adolescent [16] at baseline).

Individuals with ‘minimal risk’ (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>72,715) and ‘small risk’ (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>11,257) carried out standard bike protocols, which consisted of (1) an initial 15-s seated-rest period, (2) a 2-min phase at constant power (30 watts for women; 40 watts for men), (3) a 4-min ramp phase with linear increases in power from their initial constant power to their individually assigned peak power (to 50 and 35% of predicted maximal workload for ‘minimal’ and ‘small’ risk, respectively), and (4) a 1-min recovery period.

The risk categorization determined allocation to an individualized exercise protocol (S2 Material in Appendix), a methodology aimed at increasing the number of participants with exposure information whilst at the same time reducing the likelihood that participants experience any adverse medical events during the exercise test. Individuals with ‘minimal risk’ (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>72,715) and ‘small risk’ (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>11,257) carried out standard bike protocols, which consisted of (1) an initial 15-s seated-rest period, (2) a 2-min phase at constant power (30 watts for women; 40 watts for men), (3) a 4-min ramp phase with linear increases in power from their initial constant power to their individually assigned peak power (to 50 and 35% of predicted maximal workload for ‘minimal’ and ‘small’ risk, respectively), and (4) a 1-min recovery period. Individuals with ‘medium risk’ (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>2812) cycled at the constant power level for 6 min. Participants were asked to cycle at 60 revolutions-per-minute (RPM) during all cycling phases. Individuals in the ‘high’ risk (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>11,162) category only did a 2-min seated-rest assessment and were excluded from this analysis, as were those ‘ineligible’ for electrocardiograph testing (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1481).  Participants’ electrocardiograms were recorded at 500 Hz with a 4-lead electrocardiograph device (CAM-USB 6.5, Cardiosoft v6.51; two electrocardiograph electrodes on each upper limb) throughout the full test. The electrocardiograph signal was processed using the PhysioNet Toolkit [23] implementation of the SQRS algorithm [24], which applies a digital filter to the signal and identifies the distinctive downward slopes of QRS complexes. The resultant inter-beat-intervals were converted to beats-per-minute values, using “ihr” of the PhysioNet Toolkit [25] (restricting beat-to-beat heart rate changes to =<U+2009>10 bpm), after which linear interpolation was applied to derive heart rate at 1-s resolution. In addition, we implemented data cleaning and quality control procedures (S3 Material in Appendix). Linear regression was performed to predict workload from heart rate (S4 Material in Appendix); the established linear relationship was then extrapolated to age-predicted maximum heart rate [26] to estimate an individual’s maximal power (watts) as an indicator of CRF. Consolidation procedures were applied to obtain the most robust CRF estimate (S5 Material in Appendix). To account for differences in body size, CRF was expressed as maximal power per fat-free mass (kg) (i.e. body mass–fat mass), the latter measured using bio-impedance analysis (Tanita BC-418MA). Individuals with heart rate missing for ><U+2009>2 min (50%) during the ramp phase (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>116) or with maximum power of 0 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>156; a sign of the cycle ergometer/ECG acquisition system malfunctioning) or outliers with ><U+2009>20 watts/fat-free mass (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>41) were excluded from analyses.  Grip strength GS was assessed once in each hand using a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Jamar J00105), which can measure isometric grip force and was calibrated by staff at the start of each measurement day. Each participant grasped the handle of the device in their right hand while sitting upright on a chair with their forearm on the armrest, and whilst maintaining a 90° angle of their elbow, squeezed the handle as strongly as possible for about 3 s. The same protocol was undertaken with the left hand. GS measures have good reliability and reproducibility [27]. For the current primary analysis, values from the two hands were averaged if available; otherwise, the value from a single hand was used in a small subsample (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>204).

A large body of evidence has shown that greater levels of physical activity are associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer (WCRF-AICR, 2011; Moore et al, 2016). However, colorectal cancers are a heterogeneous collection of tumours with variable molecular characteristics, and it is hypothesised that tumours located at different anatomical subsites may have distinct aetiological risk factors (Wei et al, 2004; Limsui et al, 2010). For physical activity, generally consistent inverse relationships have been found for colon and rectal cancers, with a recent participant-level pooled analysis, which included 1.44 million participants, reporting that leisure-time physical activity was associated with lower risks of colon cancer and rectal cancer when analysed separately (Moore et al, 2016). It is unclear, however, how physical activity levels are related to colon cancer risk across the proximal and distal anatomical regions as few studies have been of sufficient size to undertake analyses by subsite, and inconsistent results have emerged. For instance, in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), an inverse relationship was reported only between total physical activity and proximal colon cancer risk, but null results were found for distal colon cancer risk (Friedenreich et al, 2006). In contrast, in other large prospective studies, inverse relationships of similar magnitude have been observed across the colonic subsites (Howard et al, 2008; Burón Pust et al, 2017; Wei et al, 2017).  Sedentary behaviours, defined as sitting or reclined posture activities which expend <U+2A7D>1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) (Owen et al, 2000), may also influence colorectal cancer risk. In the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP Diet and Health Study, sedentary behaviour (time spent watching television and videos) was associated with a greater colorectal cancer risk (Howard et al, 2008). A meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies reported that total sitting time, television viewing time, and occupational sitting time were all positively associated with colon cancer development (Schmid and Leitzmann, 2014). However, whether this relationship differs within the colon for proximal and distal tumours has been largely unstudied.""","""For physical activity, generally consistent inverse relationships have been found for colon and rectal cancers, with a recent participant level pooled analysis, which included 1.44 million participants, reporting that leisure-time physical activity was associated with lower risks of colon cancer and rectal cancer when analysed separately (Moore et al, 2016)""","Yes","Yes","""However, whether this relationship differs within the colon for proximal and distal tumours has been largely unstudied.""","""It is unclear, however, how physical activity levels are related to colon cancer risk across the proximal and distal anatomical regions as few studies have been of sufficient size to undertake analyses by subsite, and inconsistent results have emerged""","""In the current analysis, we investigated how total physical activity levels and sedentary behaviours, such as television watching and time spent using computers, are related to colorectal cancer risk in the UK Biobank study.

Questions are listed in Supplementary Table 1 and are available to view on the UK Biobank Web site (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/label.cgi?id=100054). The questions captured the frequency and duration of three different levels of activity (walking, moderate, and vigorous). Participants were asked on how many days in a typical week they engaged in each activity level for 10<U+2009>min or more. For each level in which an answer of one or more days was given, the participant was then asked how many minutes they usually spent doing that activity on a typical day. Using this information, METs were used to quantify the intensity of physical activity. The MET values represent the ratio of energy expended per kilogram of body weight per hour to the standard resting metabolic rate (Ainsworth et al, 2011). The number of days per week that participants engaged in each level of physical activity was multiplied by the number of minutes spent per day doing that activity. This gave the total number of minutes spent per week engaged in each activity category. Total MET values for each category from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form were: 3.3 for walking, 4.0 for moderate physical activity and 8.0 for vigorous physical activity (IPAQ Research Committee, 2005). We report excess METs, which are calculated by subtracting one MET from the value for each activity, and represent the energy expenditure above that of an inactive person (Howley, 2001). Excess MET values were therefore 2.3 for walking, 3.0 for moderate physical activity and 7.0 for vigorous physical activity. Excess MET-hours per week were calculated by multiplying the excess MET value for each activity by the duration of activity in hours per week (IPAQ Research Committee, 2005).

Questions are listed in Supplementary Table 1 and are available to view on the UK Biobank Web site (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/label.cgi?id=100054). The questions captured the frequency and duration of three different levels of activity (walking, moderate, and vigorous). Participants were asked on how many days in a typical week they engaged in each activity level for 10<U+2009>min or more. For each level in which an answer of one or more days was given, the participant was then asked how many minutes they usually spent doing that activity on a typical day. Using this information, METs were used to quantify the intensity of physical activity. The MET values represent the ratio of energy expended per kilogram of body weight per hour to the standard resting metabolic rate (Ainsworth et al, 2011). The number of days per week that participants engaged in each level of physical activity was multiplied by the number of minutes spent per day doing that activity. This gave the total number of minutes spent per week engaged in each activity category. Total MET values for each category from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form were: 3.3 for walking, 4.0 for moderate physical activity and 8.0 for vigorous physical activity (IPAQ Research Committee, 2005). We report excess METs, which are calculated by subtracting one MET from the value for each activity, and represent the energy expenditure above that of an inactive person (Howley, 2001). Excess MET values were therefore 2.3 for walking, 3.0 for moderate physical activity and 7.0 for vigorous physical activity. Excess MET-hours per week were calculated by multiplying the excess MET value for each activity by the duration of activity in hours per week (IPAQ Research Committee, 2005). In the baseline questionnaire, participants were also asked in a typical day how many hours they spent watching television and using a computer. This information was used as an indicator of sedentary behaviours as television watching and time spent using computers are two of the most wide-spread leisure-time sedentary behaviours in adults (Office for National Statistics, 2006)  Assessment of outcome Prevalent and incident cancer cases within the UK Biobank cohort were identified through linkage to national cancer registries. Complete follow-up was available through 30th November 2014 for England and Wales and 31st December 2014 for Scotland. Cancer incidence data were coded using the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Proximal colon cancers included those found within the caecum, appendix, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, and splenic flexure (C18.0–18.5). Distal colon cancers included those found within the descending (C18.6) and sigmoid (C18.7) colon. Overlapping (C18.8) and unspecified (C18.9) lesions of the colon were included in colon cancers only. Cancer of the rectum included cancers occurring at the recto sigmoid junction (C19) and rectum (C20).....  ...Participants were grouped into predefined categories for total physical activity levels (<10, 10–<20, 20–<40, 40–<60, <U+2A7E>60 MET hours per week), television watching time (<U+2A7D>1, 2–3, 4–5, >5<U+2009>h per day for sexes combined analyses, and <U+2A7D>1, 2–3, <U+2A7E>4<U+2009>h per day for sex-specific analyses), and time spent using computers (none, >0–1, 2–3, <U+2A7E>4<U+2009>h per day for sexes combined analyses, and none, >0–1, <U+2A7E>2<U+2009>h per day for sex-specific analyses).

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of 149,611 UK Biobank participants. Self-reported depressive and bipolar features were used to categorise participants into MDD and BD groups and a non-mood disordered comparison group.

Very few studies have investigated associations between chronic multisite pain (pain occurring at two or more body sites [3]) and mood disorders, although there is some evidence of a positive correlation between number of chronic pain sites and depressive features [4].  A study of the health records of 5 million US Veterans Affairs patients found that those with MDD or BD were 1.8 and 2.6 times more likely, respectively, to have a diagnosis of one or more painful conditions in their health records than non-mood disordered controls [5]. The prevalence of chronic pain was reported to be 23.7% in a meta-analysis of chronic pain in BD studies; and patients with BD were found to be at a two-fold increased risk of having chronic pain compared to the general population [6]. Two further studies investigating the association between chronic pain and BD suggested that pain may be under-recognised among individuals with BD. Cerimele and colleagues have reported that in a cohort of primary care patients receiving an intervention for BD 46% were also receiving treatment for pain or experiencing pain that interfered with their daily functioning [7]. In the Singapore Mental Health Study, chronic pain was the most prevalent comorbid physical condition among participants with BD, affecting 40.4% of these individuals [8]. These initial findings support the need for a better understanding of the relationships between chronic pain and mood disorder in order to improve the clinical management of these challenging to treat conditions. Further epidemiological understanding will lead to the development of biological hypotheses that might explain why chronic pain and mood disorder (depression and/or bipolar disorder) commonly co-occur.""","""Chronic pain is known to be associated with depressive features and major depressive disorder (MDD) [1,2] but the association between chronic pain and bipolar disorder (BD) has received less attention....A study of the health records of 5 million US Veterans Affairs patients found that those with MDD or BD were 1.8 and 2.6 times more likely, respectively, to have a diagnosis of one or more painful conditions in their health records than non-mood disordered controls [5].

Probable recurrent MDD (moderate): Ever depressed/down for a whole week; plus at least two weeks duration; plus at least two episodes; plus ever seen a GP (but not a psychiatrist) for ‘nerves, anxiety, depression’ OR ever anhedonic (unenthusiasm/uninterest) for a whole week; plus at least two weeks duration; plus at least two episodes; plus ever seen a GP (but not a psychiatrist) for ‘nerves, anxiety, depression’.  3. Probable recurrent MDD (severe): Ever depressed/down for a whole week; plus at least two weeks duration; plus at least two episodes; plus ever seen a psychiatrist for ‘nerves, anxiety, depression’ OR ever anhedonic (unenthusiasm/uninterest) for a whole week; plus at least two weeks duration; plus at least two episodes; plus ever seen a psychiatrist for ‘nerves, anxiety, depression’.  Classification of chronic and multisite pain At baseline assessment, participants were asked the question “In the last month have you experienced any of the following that interfered with your usual activities?” The response options related to seven specific sites of pain: headache, facial, neck or shoulder, back, stomach or abdominal, hip, and knee pain; and an eighth option of “pain all over the body”. Participants were permitted to select multiple options unless they reported having pain all over the body. Participants who indicated that they had pain were then asked whether the pain at each site had been present for more than 3 months (defined as chronic pain). Individuals were considered to have chronic multisite pain if they reported chronic pain in two body sites or more [3]. The chronic pain categories used for this study were: free of chronic pain; chronic single site pain; chronic pain at 2–3 sites; chronic pain at 4–7 sites; and chronic pain all over the body (widespread pain). Widespread pain was considered as a separate category because a participant who selected ‘pain all over the body’ may differ from one who selected seven individual sites of pain.  Confounding factors We considered sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors and medical comorbidities as important potential confounders of the relationship between chronic pain syndromes and mood disorder. The sociodemographic factors included as covariates were: sex, age (as a continuous variable), ethnic group (defined by UK Biobank as white, black or black British, Asian or Asian British and other (including mixed, Chinese and other ethnic group)), employment status and area-based socioeconomic deprivation. Participants could select more than one option for their current employment status and for this study were categorised into mutually exclusive groups: paid employment/looking after home or family, retired (unless also selected not working due to sickness), unemployed/unpaid, not working due to sickness or disability, and student (if they selected no other category). Area-based socioeconomic status was assessed using the Townsend Index, a score derived from postcode of residence information on unemployment, car ownership, owner occupation and overcrowding [12]. A higher Townsend Index score reflects higher levels of deprivation. The Townsend score was categorised into quintiles based on frequency in this study population: quintile 1 represents the least deprived and quintile 5 the most deprived areas. Lifestyle factors considered as potential confounders included: body mass index (BMI) based on actual weight and height measurements taken at the assessment centre and categorised into: underweight <18.5 kg/m2, normal weight<U+2009>=<U+2009>18.5-24.9 kg/m2, overweight =25.0-29.9 kg/m2, and obese<U+2009>=<U+2009>30.0 kg/m2 [13]; smoking status (current, former or never smokers); and frequency of alcohol consumption (daily/almost daily, 3–4 times per week, 1–2 times per week, 1–3 times per month, special occasions only and never). Doctor-diagnosis of cancer was self-reported using the touch screen questionnaire, and details of participants’ other medical conditions were based on self-report during a face to face interview with a trained nurse (UK Biobank field ID 20002). Based on previous work on multimorbidity in large population samples [14], a total of 43 long-term conditions were also classified (see Additional file 1: Table S1 for full details).

They often co-occur and long-standing debate has surrounded the temporal nature of the relationship between chronic pain and depression and on the causes and consequences of this relationship [1]. Factors affecting the presentation and management of symptoms are wide-ranging and will involve a combination of demographic, personal, lifestyle, environmental and social elements.  Population-based studies have shown that self-reported musculoskeletal pain is more prevalent among ethnic minority groups in the UK, particularly widespread pain at multiple sites of the body [2–4]. In the US, the prevalence of self-reported pain is higher in Hispanic and Black ethnic groups than non-Hispanic White individuals [5]; however, this difference was not apparent after adjusting for potential confounders such as sociodemographic status, comorbidity, and psychological distress. Minority ethnic groups in US pain clinic populations have also reported more severe or disabling pain than the non-Hispanic White population in the US [6, 7]. Recent studies in the US have focused on trying to better explain the racial and ethnic disparities in pain treatment and management, and suggest that access to healthcare, and patient attitudes and behaviours may play a role in explaining some of the disparities observed [8–10]. Similarly, ethnic minority groups have also been reported to be less likely to seek professional help for mood problems [11] yet the prevalence of depression is reported to be higher in these groups in the UK than in the majority White ethnic group [12, 13].  Few studies have specifically considered the comorbidity of chronic pain and depression across ethnic groups, rather ethnicity has been considered as a covariate in the relationship between pain and depression or as a predictor of pain and depression [14]. In a study of 866 participants, Miller and Cano (2009) found that African Americans were almost twice as likely to have comorbid depression and pain as Caucasian Americans, relative to those with no pain or depression [15]. However, it is unclear whether similar patterns would be observed amongst other ethnic groups and whether the relationship between depression and pain is similar in US and UK ethnic groups.  Chronic pain and depression have also been shown to be some of the most common comorbidities in individuals with other physical and mental long-term conditions [16–18]. Given the ethnic [19, 20] and sociodemographic [16] gradient evident in the pattern of long-term condition reporting it is important to study the relationship between socioeconomic status, ethnicity, pain, and depression independently of other physical long-term conditions, and furthermore understand whether a history of depression or current depressive symptoms are more important. Developing an understanding of these relationships has the potential to impact on how health professionals manage chronic pain in primary care, particularly for ethnic minority groups that may be less likely to present with their low mood problems.""","""Chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression are common, complex disorders that are challenging to treat and manage in primary care.

Introduction Personality traits can be used to identify the appropriate weight loss treatment and management strategies for obese patients (Munro et al., 2011). The outcome of different weight loss interventions in obese people seems to be influenced by their underlying personality traits (Gerlach et al., 2015). For example, obese people with high reward dependence and cooperativeness are more willing to participate in behavioral group therapies (Sullivan et al., 2007). Moreover, patients with lower novelty seeking are more likely to effectively lose gain with this type of intervention (Sullivan et al., 2007). On the other hand, neuroticism and conscientiousness are respectively associated with the effectiveness of sirbutramin and orlitstat pharmacological weight loss therapies (Gerlach et al., 2015). Low conscientiousness and high neuroticism, in particular, have been associated with higher body mass index (BMI) (Sutin and Terracciano, 2017) and poorer health outcomes (Atherton et al., 2014). High neuroticism has been found to enhance the effect of polygenetic predisposition toward overweight and obesity (Clarke et al., 2015), and it has been associated with inflammatory indices and other environmental/social risk factors relating to obesity (Sutin and Terracciano, 2017). The tendency toward less physical activity and/or more sedentary behaviours observed in highly neurotic people has also been proposed to be at least partially responsible for the association with BMI (Kjelsas and Augestad, 2004; Sutin and Terracciano, 2016, 2017). Conflicting evidence has however been reported. Some studies (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>11 554; n<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 495 and n<U+2009>=<U+2009>30 722, respectively) have shown low neuroticism to be associated with higher BMI (Kakizaki et al., 2008; Otonari et al., 2012; Shim et al., 2014), while a Danish study (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>5 286) has failed in finding any association between BMI and neuroticism in either men or women (Wimmelmann et al., 2018). Psychological and psychiatric comorbidities might partially explain the discrepancies across studies (Paans et al., 2016). Moreover, other unrelated factors, such as the work dimension, and in particular the physical workload, have been found to interact with neuroticism in influencing BMI (Blanch and Aluja, 2013). The association between BMI and personality seems also to differ remarkably between genders, and is more consistent in women rather than men (Sutin and Terracciano, 2016, 2017). Finally, it is worth noticing that the ethnicity of the participants varies between studies, as the samples included Asian (Kakizaki et al., 2008; Otonari et al., 2012; Shim et al., 2014), European (Wimmelmann et al., 2018) or multi-ethnical participants (Sutin and Terracciano, 2016).  In recent years, a growing body of research has linked personality traits to cognitive performance (Burles et al., 2014; Caselli et al., 2016; Chapman et al., 2017; Dar-Nimrod et al., 2012; Munoz et al., 2013; Robison et al., 2017; Waggel et al., 2015; Wettstein et al., 2016). In particular, low neuroticism has been associated to a better executive function in middle-aged (Caselli et al., 2016; Robison et al., 2017) and elderly adults (Chapman et al., 2017; Waggel et al., 2015). Remarkably, executive function has been reported to predict the health behavior of the individuals more accurately than neuroticism (Hall et al., 2014), and reduced executive function has been associated with neuroticism and two lifestyle risk factors for obesity, namely sedentary behavior and fatty food consumption (Hall et al., 2014). The factors underlying this association are still unclear. Increased cortisol is associated with both specific personality traits and worse cognitive performance (Ouanes et al., 2017), however it does not seem to be mediating the link between personality and cognition (Ouanes et al., 2017). Nonetheless, the intertwining between executive function and neuroticism might play a role in predisposing to obesity development. In fact, obesity has been linked to an impairment in executive function (Dassen et al., 2018), and therapies targeting executive function seem to meliorate health behaviors in obese people by improving their cognitive flexibility (Allom et al., 2018). On the other hand, overweight people are understudied, and evidence is lacking regarding the existence of executive functions impairments in these population (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, information are lacking regarding overweight individuals’ cognitive performance on other domains, such as fluid intelligence, which has also been found to be impaired in obesity (Spyridaki et al., 2014). Nonetheless, overweight in mid-life has been related to lower short-term memory performance in later life (Hassing et al., 2010). Accordingly, high BMI has been related to accelerated cognitive aging (Kirton and Dotson, 2016).""","""In recent years, a growing body of research has linked personality traits to cognitive performance (Burles et al., 2014; Caselli et al., 2016; Chapman et al., 2017; Dar-Nimrod et al., 2012; Munoz et al., 2013; Robison et al., 2017; Waggel et al., 2015; Wettstein et al., 2016).

The answers “Yes” and “No” were respectively assigned the values of 1 and 0, and the scores were summed up to obtain the neuroticism score.  Short-term memory was assessed with the PM and numeric memory tests. The PM test consisted in instructing the participants to memorise the position of as many matching pairs of cards as possible. The cards were then turned face down on the screen, and the participants were asked to touch as many pairs as possible in the fewest tries. Two rounds were conducted, the first round using 3 pairs of cards and the second 6 pairs of cards. As recommended by the UK Biobank website, the number of incorrect matches in round (Field ID: 399) was used as outcome variable. Only the second round, more challenging and with more variability in the responses, was considered in the present study. For the assessment of short-term numeric memory, the participants were shown a two-digit number and they were asked to remember it after a brief pause. The procedure was followed until the participant made an error or if they had remembered the maximum of twelve digits. The maximum number of digits remembered correctly was considered in this study.  Reasoning ability was measured using the fluid intelligence test, assessed with a touch-screen questionnaire consisting of 13 items. The total score obtained by the participants was considered in this study. Finally, for the TMT, the participants were presented with a series of labelled circles and instructed to touch them according to a particular ordering rule. The test consists of two parts: in the first one (path A), less challenging, the labels are represented solely by numbers; in the second part (path B), alphanumeric labels are assigned to the circles. The duration to complete both paths was recorded.

We classified the participants into three categories according to their BMI: normal weight (BMI: 18.5<U+2009>kg/m2 to 24.9<U+2009>kg/m2); overweight (BMI: 25<U+2009>kg/m2 to 29.9<U+2009>kg/m2); obese (BMI<U+2009>=<U+2009>30<U+2009>kg/m2). BMI was acquired at three time-points: the first assessment took place between 2006 and 2010; the second assessment was carried out between 2012 and 2013 (time interval between 1 and 4 years); the third assessment was carried out after 2014 (time interval between 5 and 10 years from baseline).  Neuroticism score was derived by the sum of 12 neurotic behavioral domains, as provided by the UK Biobank. In particular, the participants had been asked to answer questions regarding their tendency to experience mood swings (Field ID: 1920; “Does your mood often go up and down?”), miserableness (Field ID: 1930; “Do you ever feel 'just miserable' for no reason?”), irritability (Field ID: 1940; “Are you an irritable person?”), sensitivity/ hurt feelings (Field ID: 1950; “Are your feelings easily hurt?”), fed-up feelings (Field ID: 1960; “Do you often feel 'fed-up'?”), nervous feelings (Field ID: 1970; “Would you call yourself a nervous person?”), worrier/anxious feelings (Field ID: 1980; “Are you a worrier?”), a sensation of being tense/ ‘highly strung’ (Field ID: 1990; “Would you call yourself tense or 'highly strung'?”), worry too long after embarrassment (Field ID: 2000; “Do you worry too long after an embarrassing experience?”), suffer from ‘nerves’ (Field ID: 2010; “Do you suffer from 'nerves'?”), loneliness/isolation feelings (Field ID: 2020; “Do you often feel lonely?”), and guilty feelings (Field ID: 2030; “Are you often troubled by feelings of guilt?”). The answers “Yes” and “No” were respectively assigned the values of 1 and 0, and the scores were summed up to obtain the neuroticism score.  Short-term memory was assessed with the PM and numeric memory tests. The PM test consisted in instructing the participants to memorise the position of as many matching pairs of cards as possible. The cards were then turned face down on the screen, and the participants were asked to touch as many pairs as possible in the fewest tries. Two rounds were conducted, the first round using 3 pairs of cards and the second 6 pairs of cards. As recommended by the UK Biobank website, the number of incorrect matches in round (Field ID: 399) was used as outcome variable. Only the second round, more challenging and with more variability in the responses, was considered in the present study. For the assessment of short-term numeric memory, the participants were shown a two-digit number and they were asked to remember it after a brief pause. The procedure was followed until the participant made an error or if they had remembered the maximum of twelve digits. The maximum number of digits remembered correctly was considered in this study.  Reasoning ability was measured using the fluid intelligence test, assessed with a touch-screen questionnaire consisting of 13 items. The total score obtained by the participants was considered in this study. Finally, for the TMT, the participants were presented with a series of labelled circles and instructed to touch them according to a particular ordering rule. The test consists of two parts: in the first one (path A), less challenging, the labels are represented solely by numbers; in the second part (path B), alphanumeric labels are assigned to the circles. The duration to complete both paths was recorded. We derived the TMT ratio (B/A) as a measure of executive function (Salthouse, 2011), where a high TMT ratio reflected a worse performance.  2.3. Covariates Age was assessed based on the date of birth and the date of attending the assessment centre, truncated to whole year part. The ethnic background was chosen from an amalgam of sequential branching questions. We grouped the answers in order to reduce the number of possible backgrounds to six categories, corresponding to the “top” categories of each branch: white, mixed, Asian or Asian British, black or black British, Chinese, other ethnic groups. To assess education, the participants were asked to select which qualifications they possessed amongst: college/university degree, A/AS levels or equivalent, O/GCSEs levels or equivalent, CSEs or equivalent, NVQ/HND/HNC or equivalent, other professional qualifications, none of the above. Participants could select more than one answer. Qualifications were recoded as a binary variable, based on whether the participants held or not a college/university degree.  Smoking status was coded as current smoker, previous smoker, or never smoked. To assess alcohol intake frequency, participants were asked to report whether they consumed alcohol: daily or almost daily, three or four times a week, once or twice a week, one to three times a month, on special occasions only, or never. Touchscreen-based questions were used to assess physical activity. The questions pertained the weekly frequency and duration (in minutes) of the walking, moderate physical activity and vigorous physical activity sessions, similarly to the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. The answers less than zero and greater than 1 440 were discarded during the data quality check performed by the UK Biobank; additionally, the participants were asked to reconfirm if their answer was greater than 300. We then calculated the total metabolic equivalent per time (MET) values for each category, by using the coefficients obtained from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form (3.3 for walking, 4.0 for moderate physical activity, and 8.0 for vigorous physical activity). MET scores (minutes/week) were derived by the following formula: (No. of days per week of walking 10+ minutes* duration of walks* 3.3) + (No. of days per week of moderate physical activity 10+ minutes * duration of moderate physical activity* 4) + (No. of days per week of vigorous activity 10+ minutes * duration of vigorous physical activity* 8) (Bradbury et al., 2017).""","""Limited information on how BMI was measured and calculated but more detail about cognitive measures e.g....""Neuroticism score was derived by the sum of 12 neurotic behavioral domains, as provided by the UK Biobank.

Statistical analysis The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, v.24: https://www.ibm.com/analytics/data-science/predictive-analytics/spss-statistical-software) was used for statistical analyses. A series of separate multinomial logistic regression models were performed to investigate associations of BMI with neuroticism and cognitive performance on the numeric memory, FI, PM and TMT tests. Two models were carried out for a sensitivity analysis. The first model was corrected for age, gender, education and ethnical background. The second model was additionally corrected for smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, and physical activity. The threshold for significance was set at p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01 for the cross-sectional analysis to correct for multiple testing according to Bonferroni’s approach (0.05/5 tests). Based on previous literature, we also tested for an effect of the interaction between neuroticism and gender on BMI. Furthermore, we investigated whether age could influence the association between BMI and neuroticism or cognitive function by also testing for the effect of the age*cognition interaction on BMI. The threshold for significance was set at p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.012, to correct for multiple testing (0.05 / 4 tests).  Additionally, we ran five generalized linear models (gamma with log-link) to investigate whether BMI, when treated as continuous instead of categorical, still showed the same pattern of associations with neuroticism and cognitive function. The same two abovementioned models were run. The threshold for significance was again set at p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01 for the cross-sectional analysis to correct for multiple testing according to Bonferroni’s approach.  Correlations between neuroticism score and each of the cognitive tests were investigated via separate models according to the distribution of the dependent variables. ANOVA was used to test correlations with FI and PM (Glass et al., 1972; Harwell et al., 1992; Lix et al., 1996), while correlations with numeric memory were assessed with a negative binomial generalized linear model, and correlations with TMT were assessed with a gamma generalized linear model. The threshold for significance was set at p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.013, to correct for multiple testing according to Bonferroni. The same abovementioned adjusted models were used.  Individuals with high neuroticism tend to vary their weight more than individuals with lower neuroticism levels, in terms of decreases as well as increases in BMI (Sutin et al., 2011; Sutin and Terracciano, 2017). Thus, we investigated correlations between neuroticism and BMI variation over time. BMI variation was calculated by subtracting the baseline BMI from the BMI at each follow-up point, and considering the absolute value of the variation. As executive function has been reported to predict the health behavior of the individuals more accurately than neuroticism (Hall et al., 2014), we also investigated correlations between executive function and BMI variations. To this purpose, separate ANOVAs were carried out to test whether baseline neuroticism and TMT ratio could predict BMI variations at each of the two follow-up points. The same abovementioned models, reduced and fully-adjusted, were applied.

As executive function has been reported to predict the health behavior of the individuals more accurately than neuroticism (Hall et al., 2014), we also investigated correlations between executive function and BMI variations. To this purpose, separate ANOVAs were carried out to test whether baseline neuroticism and TMT ratio could predict BMI variations at each of the two follow-up points.

We assessed the sex-specific relationships and their differences between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI).  Methods and Results Between 2006 and 2010, the UK Biobank recruited over 500 000 participants aged 40 to 69 years across the United Kingdom. During 7 years of follow-up, 5710 cases of MI (28% women) were recorded among 265 988 women and 213 622 men without a history of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Cox regression models yielded adjusted hazard ratios for MI associated with body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio""",,"Yes",,"""There was an approximate log-linear relationship between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of MI in both sexes. A 1-SD higher in body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio, respectively, were associated with hazard ratios (confidence intervals) for MI of 1.22 (1.17; 1.28), 1.35 (1.28; 1.42), 1.49 (1.39; 1.59), and 1.34 (1.27; 1.40) in women and of 1.28 (1.23; 1.32), 1.28 (1.23; 1.33), 1.36 (1.30; 1.43), and 1.33 (1.28; 1.38) in men. The corresponding women-to-men ratios of hazard ratios were 0.96 (0.91; 1.02), 1.07 (1.00; 1.14), 1.15 (1.06; 1.24), and 1.03 (0.97; 1.09).  Conclusions Although general and central adiposity measures each have profound deleterious effects on the risk of MI in both sexes, a higher waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio conferred a greater excess risk of MI in women than in men. Waist-to-hip ratio was more strongly associated with the risk of MI than body mass index in both sexes, especially in women.""",,"Yes",,"!Excess adipose tissue is a major, and increasingly common, risk factor for chronic diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI), the leading cause of death worldwide.1, 2 In 2016, the World Health Organization estimated that more than 40% of women and 39% of men worldwide were overweight (defined as a body mass index [BMI] of >25 kg/m2) and that over 15% of women and 11% of men were obese (BMI >30 kg/m2).3  BMI is the most widely used measure to assess the prevalence of overweight and obesity across populations and to quantify the detrimental effects of excess adipose tissue on the risk of MI in later life. However, BMI is a measure of general adiposity and does not discriminate between adipose tissue present in visceral and subcutaneous areas. Yet, as compared with subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue is more metabolically active, is closely related to insulin resistance, and may be more strongly associated with cardiometabolic risk.4, 5 Measures of central adiposity and body composition, including waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio, may, therefore, be better suited than BMI for quantifying the etiological relationship between adiposity and cardiovascular disease. Although some studies have reported that measures of central adiposity are more strongly related to cardiovascular risk than BMI,6, 7, 8, 9, 10 others have found minimal differences across anthropometric measures and reported that each measure was similarly associated with the risk of future MI.11, 12  There are substantial sex differences in body fat distribution, with a predominance of subcutaneous fat in women and visceral fat in men.13, 14 Although the association between BMI and the risk of MI is broadly similar between women and men,15 it is conceivable that there is a sex differential in the effects of central adiposity on the risk of MI—with potentially stronger effects in women than men. However, most previous studies did not report the associations between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of MI separately for women and men.

Dynamic stress vulnerability models have reported links between reduced exposure to green environments and enhanced vulnerability to the negative health effects of stressful life events, which can result in increments in the proportion of the population with mental disorders and an overall reduction in the mental capital of cities.2, 3, 4 In recent years, mental disorders, including mood disorders, have emerged as a leading cause of global disease burden. They also act as risk factors for the development of communicable and non-communicable diseases, and contribute to accidental and non-accidental injuries.5, 6, 7 The UK's total annual expenditure on brain disorders was estimated to be approximately €134 billion in 2010, of which €19·24 billion was incurred on mood disorders, accounting for approximately 3·9 million annual cases or 8·73% of all brain disorders.8  The causes of mental health disorders are complex, with a long latency between exposures and subsequent incidence and progression. A systems-based life course approach towards enhancing the mental capital of cities and wellbeing of their populations has been proposed.9 The importance of such a holistic approach has been emphasised by the inclusion of mental health within the Sustainable Development Goals.10, 11 Relatedly, exposure to residential green environment has also been regarded as an effective upstream-level urban intervention with an aim to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders.12  Research in context  Evidence before this study  We searched online databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO, Scopus, and Google/Google Scholar databases, for studies and reports published in English between Jan 1, 1984, and Feb 10, 2018, using a combination of search terms, including “residential greenness”, “green space”, “NDVI”, or “built environment”, and “mental health”, “depression”, or “major depressive disorder”.  Mental health disorders have emerged as a leading cause of the global burden of disease. At the same time, the present unprecedented pace of urbanisation and an increasing proportion of impervious built-up spaces in our cities have resulted in reduced exposures to salutogenic green environments. Several studies have examined the links between exposure to green environments and mental health, with most studies suggesting beneficial effects. Green exposure has been measured in terms of access to green spaces (proportion of green spaces within a residential neighbourhood) as well as the general salutogenic potential of green environments. The protective effects of residential green have been hypothesised to originate from one or more of its functional roles: as restorative stress-relieving spaces; supportive social interaction spaces promoting a sense of community; active living spaces facilitating physical activity; and natural filters ameliorating the adverse effects of negative exposures such as air, noise, and thermal pollution.  Notwithstanding the evidence generated so far, the links between residential green exposure and mental health still remain equivocal in adults. Many of the studies linking residential green exposure with mental health have used coarse measures of green exposure, whereas a few studies have used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index as an index of salutogenic green, although of low-to-moderate spatial resolution. Most studies so far have been small scale and done in homogeneous environmental settings, resulting in limited statistical power and generalisability....Some studies report a beneficial effect of contact with green environments on health, in general,13, 14, 15 and more specifically, with regard to stress, mood, and mental health.16, 17 Several studies have established a protective independent association between various indicators of mental health and the percentage of green space within a residential neighbourhood,18, 19, 20, 21 the amount of tree cover in an urban area,22 and the overall exposure of individuals to salutogenic green environments.23, 24, 25 These protective effects of residential green spaces have been explained in terms of four mechanisms related to their specific functional roles: restorative, stress-relieving spaces;4, 26, 27, 28 supportive, social interaction spaces that promote a sense of community;29 active living spaces that facilitate physical activity;30, 31, 32 and natural filters that ameliorate the adverse effects of air, noise, and thermal pollution.33, 34, 35  Despite the substantial body of evidence, the links between residential green exposure and mental health still remain far from conclusive in adults.17 Many of the studies have used coarse measures of green exposure, expressed as a proportion of greenness based on land cover maps within a specific catchment or census geography, thereby neglecting to include private gardens, street trees, and green spaces that do not meet a specific criterion, such as a size threshold, and hindering the study's replicability and comparability. A few studies have used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an index of greenery derived from Landsat satellite data, as an overall measure of green exposure (although at a low-to-moderate resolution). Most studies so far have been small scale and done in homogeneous environmental settings, resulting in limited statistical power and generalisability.

UKBUMP is a high-resolution spatial database of health-influencing environment exposures modelled within multiscale residential neighbourhoods of each UK Biobank participant's geocoded dwelling. Environmental exposure metrics were developed through spatial and network analyses of data from multiple UK-wide spatial databases, resulting in multiple exposure variables related to greenness, urban density, destination accessibility, street-level accessibility, terrain, and deprivation.43, 44 Briefly, UKBUMP was developed by geocoding participants' dwelling addresses to the level of building footprints, delineating multiscale dwelling neighbourhoods by defining street network buffers centred on the geocoded dwelling locations in ArcGIS12 Network Analyst, and measuring environmental exposures within these functional neighbourhoods. After linking the exposure metrics to the participants' dwelling locations, the data were reanonymised. Accurate data on building-level land uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated Transport Network databases, whereas residential greenness was modelled from high-resolution (50<U+2008>×<U+2008>50 cm2) colour infrared data captured during aerial photography with the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4.43  Residential greenness Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank participants' dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote sensing device. Chlorophyll in healthy vegetation absorbs radiation in the visible red region (630–690 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflects radiation in the near-infrared region (760–900 nm). This differential in the absorbance and reflectance of wavelengths by chlorophyll is used as a proxy for green quality and intensity. The differential is measured using the following formula:   The formula includes the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the visible (RED) and near-infrared regions (NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Index scores range between -1 and 1, with higher values indicating higher densities of green vegetation.  In the present study, NDVI greenness was derived from a series of 0·5 m resolution, colour-infrared imagery collected by Bluesky (Ashby-De-La-Zouch, UK) with the help of specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Summer-time images of the study areas collected over similar temporal scales (across the baseline phase of the UK Biobank study) were stitched together to avoid temporal mismatch. After excluding large water bodies, we modelled mean NDVI within a 500 m residential buffer of each UK Biobank participant. Selection of a 500 m catchment area for measuring residential green exposures was based on our previous studies46, 47 and on other previous reports48, 49 that used a quarter mile (400–500 m) neighbourhood for measuring NDVI greenness.""","""Residential   environment   exposure   data   were   derived   from  the  UK  Biobank  Urban  Morphometric  Platform  (UKBUMP)...Residential  exposure  to  salutogenic  green  environment  was   measured   in   terms   of   mean   NDVI   within   a   500   m   catchment   radius   of   geocoded   UK   Biobank   participants’   dwellings...

As such, the metric is able to differentiate between flat and hilly surface within the residential catchment.  Exposure to PM2·5 obtained from UK Biobank's linked air pollution exposure data was used as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution. The measurement was based on monitoring on three occasions over a 14 day period during the cold, warm, and intermediate seasons of the year. Individual annual exposure to particulate matter concentrations around geocoded residential addresses was derived from land-use regression models.50  Built environment Built-environment metrics from UKBUMP were assessed within a 1 km street catchment of participants' dwellings. Street-level movement density was modelled in terms of through-movement potential of the street segments, also termed as betweenness centrality in graph theoretic terminology. The method has been used in active living research and described elsewhere.51, 52 The UK-wide street network data for the study area comprised approximately 4 million street segments, which were extracted from the OS MasterMap Integrated Transport Network database, transcribed into an access graph model, and subjected to network analysis in sDNA53 to model street-level movement density. Movement density is expressed as the simulated counts of movement through each link in the network, given its relative position and topological connectivity with other segments within the network. The measure also acts as a proxy for relative accessibility and centrality of a place. Betweenness centrality of x in a graph of N links might be defined as:  <U+025B> <U+025B>  In the formula, y and z are the geodesic endpoints; Ry is the set of links within a defined neighbourhood catchment from y; L(y) is the length of link y and L(z) is the length of link z; and P(z) is the proportion of link z within the defined radius.

Socioeconomic status was assessed at household and neighbourhood levels in terms of mean annual household income before tax and Townsend deprivation index scores,54 which is a composite index of four postcode-level socioeconomic status variables (household overcrowding, unemployment, non-home ownership, and non-car ownership), with a higher score indicative of lower neighbourhood socioeconomic status.  We used participation in leisure and social activities as a proxy for social interaction and support. Level of participation was based on response to the questionnaire: “Which of the following do you attend once a week or more often? (You can select more than one)”; with available responses being none; pub or social club; religious group; sports club or gym; and adult education class or other group activity. Responses were converted into a six-factor variable: none, pub or social club, religious group, sports club or gym, adult education class and other, and combination of two or more activities...Statistical analyses The prevalence of lifetime experience of probable major depressive disorder was modelled as a two factor variable (case or non-case) as per UK Biobank's assessment protocol. Age was coded as a three-factor variable (38–50 years, 51–60 years, or 61–73 years) and sex as a two-factor variable (female or male).

UKBUMP is a high-resolution spatial database of health-influencing environment exposures modelled within multiscale residential neighbourhoods of each UK Biobank participant's geocoded dwelling. Environmental exposure metrics were developed through spatial and network analyses of data from multiple UK-wide spatial databases, resulting in multiple exposure variables related to greenness, urban density, destination accessibility, street-level accessibility, terrain, and deprivation.43, 44 Briefly, UKBUMP was developed by geocoding participants' dwelling addresses to the level of building footprints, delineating multiscale dwelling neighbourhoods by defining street network buffers centred on the geocoded dwelling locations in ArcGIS12 Network Analyst, and measuring environmental exposures within these functional neighbourhoods. After linking the exposure metrics to the participants' dwelling locations, the data were reanonymised. Accurate data on building-level land uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated Transport Network databases, whereas residential greenness was modelled from high-resolution (50<U+2008>×<U+2008>50 cm2) colour infrared data captured during aerial photography with the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4.43  Residential greenness Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank participants' dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote sensing device. Chlorophyll in healthy vegetation absorbs radiation in the visible red region (630–690 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflects radiation in the near-infrared region (760–900 nm). This differential in the absorbance and reflectance of wavelengths by chlorophyll is used as a proxy for green quality and intensity. The differential is measured using the following formula:   The formula includes the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the visible (RED) and near-infrared regions (NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Index scores range between -1 and 1, with higher values indicating higher densities of green vegetation.  In the present study, NDVI greenness was derived from a series of 0·5 m resolution, colour-infrared imagery collected by Bluesky (Ashby-De-La-Zouch, UK) with the help of specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Summer-time images of the study areas collected over similar temporal scales (across the baseline phase of the UK Biobank study) were stitched together to avoid temporal mismatch. After excluding large water bodies, we modelled mean NDVI within a 500 m residential buffer of each UK Biobank participant. Selection of a 500 m catchment area for measuring residential green exposures was based on our previous studies46, 47 and on other previous reports48, 49 that used a quarter mile (400–500 m) neighbourhood for measuring NDVI greenness.  Physical environment Among the physical environment exposures, terrain was modelled in ArcGIS12 Spatial Analyst from a 5 m resolution Bluesky digital terrain model and expressed as variability (SD) of slope, in degrees, within a 0·5 km residential catchment of UK Biobank participants' dwellings.

UKBUMP is a high-resolution spatial database of health-influencing environment exposures modelled within multiscale residential neighbourhoods of each UK Biobank participant's geocoded dwelling. Environmental exposure metrics were developed through spatial and network analyses of data from multiple UK-wide spatial databases, resulting in multiple exposure variables related to greenness, urban density, destination accessibility, street-level accessibility, terrain, and deprivation.43, 44 Briefly, UKBUMP was developed by geocoding participants' dwelling addresses to the level of building footprints, delineating multiscale dwelling neighbourhoods by defining street network buffers centred on the geocoded dwelling locations in ArcGIS12 Network Analyst, and measuring environmental exposures within these functional neighbourhoods. After linking the exposure metrics to the participants' dwelling locations, the data were reanonymised. Accurate data on building-level land uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated Transport Network databases, whereas residential greenness was modelled from high-resolution (50<U+2008>×<U+2008>50 cm2) colour infrared data captured during aerial photography with the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4.43  Residential greenness Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank participants' dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote sensing device. Chlorophyll in healthy vegetation absorbs radiation in the visible red region (630–690 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflects radiation in the near-infrared region (760–900 nm). This differential in the absorbance and reflectance of wavelengths by chlorophyll is used as a proxy for green quality and intensity. The differential is measured using the following formula:   The formula includes the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the visible (RED) and near-infrared regions (NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Index scores range between -1 and 1, with higher values indicating higher densities of green vegetation.  In the present study, NDVI greenness was derived from a series of 0·5 m resolution, colour-infrared imagery collected by Bluesky (Ashby-De-La-Zouch, UK) with the help of specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Summer-time images of the study areas collected over similar temporal scales (across the baseline phase of the UK Biobank study) were stitched together to avoid temporal mismatch. After excluding large water bodies, we modelled mean NDVI within a 500 m residential buffer of each UK Biobank participant. Selection of a 500 m catchment area for measuring residential green exposures was based on our previous studies46, 47 and on other previous reports48, 49 that used a quarter mile (400–500 m) neighbourhood for measuring NDVI greenness.  Physical environment Among the physical environment exposures, terrain was modelled in ArcGIS12 Spatial Analyst from a 5 m resolution Bluesky digital terrain model and expressed as variability (SD) of slope, in degrees, within a 0·5 km residential catchment of UK Biobank participants' dwellings. As such, the metric is able to differentiate between flat and hilly surface within the residential catchment.  Exposure to PM2·5 obtained from UK Biobank's linked air pollution exposure data was used as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution. The measurement was based on monitoring on three occasions over a 14 day period during the cold, warm, and intermediate seasons of the year. Individual annual exposure to particulate matter concentrations around geocoded residential addresses was derived from land-use regression models.50  Built environment Built-environment metrics from UKBUMP were assessed within a 1 km street catchment of participants' dwellings. Street-level movement density was modelled in terms of through-movement potential of the street segments, also termed as betweenness centrality in graph theoretic terminology. The method has been used in active living research and described elsewhere.51, 52 The UK-wide street network data for the study area comprised approximately 4 million street segments, which were extracted from the OS MasterMap Integrated Transport Network database, transcribed into an access graph model, and subjected to network analysis in sDNA53 to model street-level movement density. Movement density is expressed as the simulated counts of movement through each link in the network, given its relative position and topological connectivity with other segments within the network. The measure also acts as a proxy for relative accessibility and centrality of a place. Betweenness centrality of x in a graph of N links might be defined as:  <U+025B> <U+025B>  In the formula, y and z are the geodesic endpoints; Ry is the set of links within a defined neighbourhood catchment from y; L(y) is the length of link y and L(z) is the length of link z; and P(z) is the proportion of link z within the defined radius.  The origin-destination function (OD) is defined as:   An objective index of urbanicity within a 1 km residential catchment was developed from the UKBUMP built-environment variables to investigate associations between residential greenness and major depressive disorder, stratified by urbanicity quartiles. Urbanicity was defined as:   The formula includes the density of residential housing (resid), retail (retail), and public transport (PT) in units per km2 street catchment, in addition to street-level movement density (street movement).  Individual-level covariates On the basis of previous scientific literature, the study adjusted for demographic covariates (age, sex, highest educational qualification, and employment status), smoking status, and prevalent comorbidities (body-mass index [BMI] status, doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease, and diabetes).  Socioeconomic status was assessed at household and neighbourhood levels in terms of mean annual household income before tax and Townsend deprivation index scores,54 which is a composite index of four postcode-level socioeconomic status variables (household overcrowding, unemployment, non-home ownership, and non-car ownership), with a higher score indicative of lower neighbourhood socioeconomic status.  We used participation in leisure and social activities as a proxy for social interaction and support. Level of participation was based on response to the questionnaire: “Which of the following do you attend once a week or more often? (You can select more than one)”; with available responses being none; pub or social club; religious group; sports club or gym; and adult education class or other group activity. Responses were converted into a six-factor variable: none, pub or social club, religious group, sports club or gym, adult education class and other, and combination of two or more activities.

The method has been used in active living research and described elsewhere.51, 52 The UK-wide street network data for the study area comprised approximately 4 million street segments, which were extracted from the OS MasterMap Integrated Transport Network database, transcribed into an access graph model, and subjected to network analysis in sDNA53 to model street-level movement density. Movement density is expressed as the simulated counts of movement through each link in the network, given its relative position and topological connectivity with other segments within the network. The measure also acts as a proxy for relative accessibility and centrality of a place. Betweenness centrality of x in a graph of N links might be defined as:  <U+025B> <U+025B>  In the formula, y and z are the geodesic endpoints; Ry is the set of links within a defined neighbourhood catchment from y; L(y) is the length of link y and L(z) is the length of link z; and P(z) is the proportion of link z within the defined radius.  The origin-destination function (OD) is defined as:   An objective index of urbanicity within a 1 km residential catchment was developed from the UKBUMP built-environment variables to investigate associations between residential greenness and major depressive disorder, stratified by urbanicity quartiles. Urbanicity was defined as:   The formula includes the density of residential housing (resid), retail (retail), and public transport (PT) in units per km2 street catchment, in addition to street-level movement density (street movement).  Individual-level covariates On the basis of previous scientific literature, the study adjusted for demographic covariates (age, sex, highest educational qualification, and employment status), smoking status, and prevalent comorbidities (body-mass index [BMI] status, doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease, and diabetes).  Socioeconomic status was assessed at household and neighbourhood levels in terms of mean annual household income before tax and Townsend deprivation index scores,54 which is a composite index of four postcode-level socioeconomic status variables (household overcrowding, unemployment, non-home ownership, and non-car ownership), with a higher score indicative of lower neighbourhood socioeconomic status.  We used participation in leisure and social activities as a proxy for social interaction and support. Level of participation was based on response to the questionnaire: “Which of the following do you attend once a week or more often? (You can select more than one)”; with available responses being none; pub or social club; religious group; sports club or gym; and adult education class or other group activity. Responses were converted into a six-factor variable: none, pub or social club, religious group, sports club or gym, adult education class and other, and combination of two or more activities.  Statistical analyses The prevalence of lifetime experience of probable major depressive disorder was modelled as a two factor variable (case or non-case) as per UK Biobank's assessment protocol. Age was coded as a three-factor variable (38–50 years, 51–60 years, or 61–73 years) and sex as a two-factor variable (female or male). Highest educational attainment was defined as a five-factor variable (none; O levels, GCSEs, or CSEs; A levels or AS levels; NVQ, HND, HNC, or other professional qualification; or college or university degree) and employment as a three-factor variable (employed; retired; or unemployed, home maker, or other). Mean annual household income before tax was expressed as a four-factor variable (<£18<U+2008>000, £18<U+2008>000–£30<U+2008>999, £31<U+2008>000–£51<U+2008>999, or =£52<U+2008>000). The household income data were available for 82<U+2008>839 participants in the analytical sample. Townsend scores were categorised into quintiles and used as a five-factor variable. Smoking status was coded as non-smoker, previous smoker, and current smoker. Doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease was transformed into a four-factor variable (none; high blood pressure; heart attack, angina, or stroke; or both high blood pressure and heart attack, angina, or stroke) and diabetes was coded as a two-factor variables (yes or no). Measured BMI status was expressed as a three-factor variable (<25 kg/m2; =25 kg/m2 and <30 kg/m2; or =30 kg/m2). Terrain variability and walkability (expressed as movement density) were transformed into quartiles.  The study followed a multi-layered analyses strategy.

Methods: In the present cross-sectional study, the dietary and nutrient intake collected via up to five consecutive 24-h dietary recalls and a food frequency questionnaire of 444 individuals (aged 46-79 years) consuming <26% of calories from carbohydrate (LCHO) was compared with that of 131 897 individuals consuming =45% calories from carbohydrate (NCHO) using the UK Biobank Dataset.

In the UK, it was reported that 3 million people had tried the LCHO diet in 2003 1, with the Atkins diet books alone having sold over 45 million books in the latter half of the 20th century 2. Carbohydrate (CHO) restriction, where the restriction is sufficient and adhered to 3-5, appears to confer particular metabolic benefits for the management of type 2 diabetes 4, 6, including a reduction in post-prandial glycaemia. However, the long-term health effects in the wider population are not clear. This raises questions of its long-term safety and efficacy, which warrants ongoing investigation into the dietary habits of such individuals 7, 8.  It is important to note that there is no singular definition of what constitutes a LCHO diet, although a CHO content comprising <26% of calories (or <130 g CHO) has been suggested as a cut-off 9. Variations of the LCHO diet differ in their permitted levels of macronutrients, such as the low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, which emphasises the importance of increasing fat consumption 10, whereas others increase protein to a greater degree 11. Absolute intakes (i.e. additional grammes) of protein or fat may not increase at all, mirroring a low calorie diet as a result of a reduced overall intake 12. The replacing food or macronutrient may also be an important determinant of the health effects of LCHO diets 4, 7, 8. However, most of the data on food and nutrient consumption in a LCHO diet have been collected in clinical trials 5-8, where participants are instructed to follow a particular dietary pattern. Therefore, to determine nutritional adequacy, it is important to establish what free-living individuals on a CHO-restricted diet are consuming.  A recent study compared the dietary intakes of individuals consuming fewer than 40% of calories from CHO with those who were consuming =40% in the UK. Although people on a reduced-CHO diet consumed more red and processed meat and fewer fruits compared to those on a normal-CHO diet, they also consumed more oily fish and vegetables 13. Therefore, CHO restriction may be associated with both healthy and less-healthy dietary choices. A weakness of the study was the high cut-off used to define the LCHO group with the aim of generating a sufficient number of subjects from the limited data available.""","Description and definition low-carbohydrate diets, proposed health benefits and possible importance of individual food/macronutrients which form part of a LCHO","Yes","Yes","""A recent study compared the dietary intakes of individuals consuming fewer than 40% of calories from CHO with those who were consuming =40% in the UK.

A weakness of the study was the high cut-off used to define the LCHO group with the aim of generating a sufficient number of subjects from the limited data available. A lower boundary would be more likely to produce a group of individuals intentionally reducing their CHO intake and thus produce a more accurate representation of dietary and nutrient consumption.

These included an estimate of the weekly consumption (never, less than once a week, once a week, two to four times a week, more than five times a week) of red and processed meats, poultry, non-oily and oily fish, cheese and alcoholic beverages, as well as the approximate number of tablespoons of fruit or vegetables consumed per day, type of milk, bread, cereal and spread, and whether or not the individual adds salt to food.  In addition, a 24-h dietary recall was collected at baseline, as well as on four further occasions from 2009 to 2012. The average time period between recalls was 6 months. The dietary data were collected using a touchscreen Oxford WebQ online 24-h dietary recall questionnaire 20. Individuals were asked whether they ate or drank any of the approximately 200 commonly-consumed foods in the previous 24 h, as well as the amount, using incremental estimates of portion sizes (quarter of a portion, half a portion, one portion, etc.). The data were then used to estimate macro- and micronutrient intakes based on McCance and Widdowson's The Composition of Food, 5th edition21...The independent variables were created by splitting the dataset into those with a percentage of total calories of CHO <26% and those =45%, as well as those with an CHO intake of <130 g day–1 and =225 g day–1. The data for those consuming =26% and <45% (or =130 g and <225 g) were discarded. The CHO intake was only available for individuals with completed 24-h recalls, which limited the dataset to 210 465 individuals. Macro- and micronutrient intakes, fibre and total sugar were created by averaging their reported intake across each of the 24-h dietary recalls. Micronutrient intakes were calculated as percentages of age- and sex-specific Reference Nutrient Intakes (RNI) 27. Foods and groups analysed were those indicative of healthful or unhealthful dietary patterns that were used in previous research 13. Median portion sizes were calculated from the consecutive 24-h dietary recalls following recoding. For example, the BIOBANK code of 444 (quarter of a portion) was recoded to 0.25 and a BIOBANK code of 555 (half a portion) was recoded to 0.5. Where individuals reporting having 4+ or 5+ portion sizes, this was coded as 4 and 5, respectively. The BIOBANK 24-h recall dataset does not have an option for ‘zero’ or ‘none’ of a food. Therefore, where a person had completed a 24-h recall that visit but there was no response (missing data) noted for a food, the missing data were recoded as 0. Food groups (processed meats and high-sugar, high-fat puddings and snacks) were created by adding the median intake of all individual foods in that category. Total fruits and vegetables were both calculated by totalling the number of different reported fruits and vegetables consumed over the four dietary recalls, without consideration for the portion size reported.

Processed meats were consumed with greater frequency in the NCHO group compared to the LCHO groups when defined by grammes (see Supporting information, Table S1). Median daily intake of nuts, seeds and oily fish was significantly higher in the LCHO groups (Table 2), although the intake of these items was relatively low, with only 20% of the whole cohort consuming the recommended amount of oily fish twice a week (see Supporting information, Table S1). Similarly, the NCHO groups consumed significantly more pulses than the LCHO groups, although the overall consumption of these items was low (Table 2).  More than half of both LCHO groups consumed butter as their spread of choice compared to one-third of the NCHO groups (Table 3). People consuming a NCHO diet also reported a significantly greater amount and variety of fruits and vegetables consumed (Table 3). Of note, most people on both LCHO diets reported having consumed zero types of fruits across the 24-h dietary recalls, with a further quarter having only one portion (Table 2). Similarly, a greater proportion of people on a LCHO diet reported consuming zero types of vegetables across the 24-h dietary recalls, although there were no differences between the groups with respect to the percentage of people consuming more than four servings across the dietary recalls.  Intake of macro- and micronutrients The reported intakes of macronutrients, total sugar and fibre were all significantly different regardless of whether LCHO was calculated by kcal or the absolute number of grammes (Table 4). All groups exceeded the recommendations for saturated fat. Both LCHO groups reported a fibre intake of =11 g per day but, across all groups, fibre intake fell short of the current recommendations of the American Association of Analytical Chemists of 30 g day–1 (approximately 24 g fibre day–1 as calculated via the Englyst method used in UK Biobank).

Individuals in the NCHO groups reported consuming substantially more foods such as doughnuts, pastries, biscuits and chocolate compared to the LCHO groups. A potential advantage of LCHO diets includes the observation that, by reducing dietary CHO, such diets will inevitably reduce added sugars 13. Furthermore, because much of the added sugar in the UK diet comes from foods that are also high in fat, LCHO diets lead to a reduction in these energy-dense, highly palatable items, which are over-consumed across the UK population 28. The present analysis suggests this may be the case and the findings are supported by a cross-sectional study in a US population reporting that added sugars provided 4% kcal in the LCHO group (<30% kcal from CHO) versus 21% in the high CHO group (>55% kcal from CHO) 29. Reverse causality cannot be ruled out, although a previous study also found that the reduction in CHO was associated with a selective reduction in added sugars 13. The UK Biobank dataset provides total sugars from all sources (all mono- and disaccharides, including those from milk and present in the structure of foods, such as fruit and vegetables) and so it is not possible to determine the association between the CHO restriction and added sugar restriction in the present study. In any case, to determine whether a LCHO diet leads to a specific reduction in added sugars, a prospective study in people intentionally following a LCHO diet would be required.  Similar to a previous analysis 13, the present study finds that individuals in the LCHO group consume higher quantities of meat, poultry and fish compared to people on a NCHO diet. In general, these differences were small and the statistical significance is a consequence of the large sample size in the study. Poultry appeared to be the most frequently consumed source of animal protein across the whole cohort and close to half of individuals reported consuming beef, lamb and pork less than once per week. This likely reflects the fact that the BIOBANK and similar volunteer cohorts tend to engage in healthier behaviours than the wider population 30. However, only 20% of people in the LCHO group and 15% in the NCHO groups met the current recommendations for oily fish consumption. The consumption of vegetable-sources of protein was higher in the NCHO groups but, in general, they were consumed in small amounts across the cohort. Nuts, seeds and pulses are also high in micronutrients, fibre and other non-nutritive components likely beneficial for health 31-33. Therefore, most individuals in the UK BIOBANK cohort would benefit from increasing their consumption of oily fish, nuts, seeds and pulses, irrespective of whether they are consuming a NCHO or LCHO diet.  Fruit and vegetable intake were calculated by summing each different fruit and vegetable that was consumed over each of the 24-h dietary recalls and thus appeared high compared to typically reported intakes 13. Fruit was consumed much less frequently and in much less variety in the LCHO compared to the NCHO group, which might be a result of individuals on a LCHO diet attempting to avoid excessive ‘sugar’. Mono- and di-saccharides are often referred to under the umbrella of ‘sugar’ in the lay press, despite lactose, glucose and fructose having substantially different glycaemic indices 34 and distinct metabolic effects. For example, fructose consumed in excess, and in particular in liquid form, is causally related to hepatic triglyceride deposition 35, whereas fruit consumed in typical quantities lowers post-prandial glucose compared to starch and other sugars, without deleterious effects on metabolic function 36. If individuals are concerned about the glycaemic effect of whole fruits, advice could be offered on low-glycaemic varieties.  The LCHO groups had a higher percentage of people consuming zero servings of vegetables over the five dietary recalls compared to the NCHO groups. Two previous studies have indicated that people consuming a LCHO eating pattern eat more vegetables, which may be due to their largely negligible available CHO content 13, 37. The difference in the present study may be that the LCHO group in the UK BIOBANK had higher material deprivation. Vegetables, when eaten in variety, can provide a substantial amount of fibres, micronutrients and non-nutritive compounds 38. Fibre is particularly important when individuals are consuming fewer high-fibre foods such as cereals, wholegrain breads and fruits. Notwithstanding the limitation of the LCHO data originating primarily from one 24-dietary recall, it is of some concern that a large proportion of people report having zero vegetables. Individuals who aim to follow a LCHO diet should be counselled to consume sufficient vegetables, with an emphasis on the benefits for general and gastrointestinal health.  An oft-cited concern regarding LCHO diets is that they may be deficient in key nutrients 2. In the present study, only potassium and magnesium were lower than the recommended intakes for the LCHO diets. Caution must be applied to these results because 24-h dietary recalls can be unreliable for micronutrients 39. Nevertheless, potassium and magnesium are under-consumed across the population, with lower intakes in reduced-carbohydrate diets being reported previously 13, and potassium intake from 24-h dietary recalls may be comparable to dietary records 39. Increasing the consumption of fruits (low-glycaemic if necessary) and vegetables alongside, nuts, dairy products and oily fish would be a sensible, whole-diet centred recommendation for people consuming both LCHO and NCHO diets.  To our knowledge, the calorie contribution of alcohol in LCHO diets has not been discussed at length previously. Alcohol consumption in this study is significantly higher in both LCHO groups than in the NCHO groups, even when the proportion of CHO is calculated from non-alcohol kcal. If we calculate a LCHO diet from total energy intake (data not shown), alcohol contributes up to 16% of the calories consumed in the LCHO group. We note this because alcohol calories are not mentioned in documents suggesting cut-offs for LCHO diets 9 and, accordingly, future analyses in this area should take this into account. Furthermore, alcohol intake should be considered within the context of CHO restriction and practitioners should work with patients to ensure that alcohol is not replacing CHO.""","""the reported intakes of keyfoods and food groups differed between the LCHO and NCHO groups, although both groups included foods thatwere both beneficial and potentially deleterious to long-term health.""","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","see 18","""Some weaknesses must be acknowledged.

It would also be useful to determine the reason why people choose to follow the diet to observe whether this influences dietary choices such as the consumption of fruits.

Among people of European origin, primary open-angle glaucoma accounts for around 70–85% of all cases of glaucoma, hence risk factors for POAG would be expected to predominate as determinants of disease in a UK population. Self-reported glaucoma cases were older and more likely to be male than those without the diagnosis. The rate of self-reported glaucoma increased nonlinearly with age. Black and Asian people were significantly more likely to report a diagnosis of glaucoma than White participants. Among our study participants, the overall self-reported glaucoma rate was 1.7% in people aged 40–69 years. This rate of disease appears lower than figures from population prevalence studies in European derived populations aged 40 years and older (2.08% Baltimore Whites, USA; 2.0% Melbourne, Australia; 2.9% Egna-Neumarkt, Italy), where participants were all examined for glaucoma7, 21, 22 It has been well established in population-based studies in industrialized nations that at least 50% of all glaucoma remains undiagnosed.10, 23, 24 One recent study in the US using NHANES data puts the proportion of undiagnosed disease at 78%.25 We therefore expect the rate of self-reported glaucoma in UK Biobank to be lower than published population surveys owing to undiagnosed disease.  One of the most striking finding of our study was that, among UK Biobank participants, those who report a diagnosis of glaucoma were more likely to have a lower income and be from a relatively less affluent background. Participants in the lowest income group (<£18<U+2009>000/year) were significantly more likely to have self-reported glaucoma, compared with any other income category, after adjusting for age, sex, race, IOP, and visual acuity. The mean Townsend deprivation index was -0.72 for those reporting glaucoma and -0.95 for those without (P<0.001). This indicates that both groups are less deprived than the UK average (index=0, scores>0 indicate relative deprivation), but those reporting a diagnosis of glaucoma were less likely to be as affluent as those without disease. Furthermore, we observed a gradient toward higher rates of glaucoma with decreasing income across the socioeconomic spectrum. Among a cohort who are less deprived than the UK average, the findings of reduced affluence among those reporting disease than in those who do not, and of a trend toward increased rate of disease across the spectrum of income groups are both novel, and important for understanding the mechanisms which drive the previously reported association between socioeconomic deprivation and late presentation of glaucoma.""","""Self-reported glaucoma cases were older and more likely to be male than those without the diagnosis.

On the contrary, if people from more deprived background have greater barriers to health seeking behavior and care, one would expect that they would be less likely to be aware of their diagnosis and not report it, and probably less likely to attend health research activities such as UK Biobank.

These two facts give an important new perspective to views on the relationship between glaucoma and socioeconomics. There are undoubtedly barriers to eye care for detection and treatment.

Diet group classification For classification of diet groups, relevant dietary information from the touch-screen questionnaire was used. Participants were asked their frequency of consumption of processed meat, beef, lamb or mutton, pork, chicken, turkey or other poultry, oily fish, or other types of fish, in 6 categories of frequency ranging from “Never” to “Once or more daily.” Participants were also asked whether they never ate eggs or foods containing eggs or dairy products.  On the basis of these questions, 6 diet groups (regular meat eaters, low meat eaters, poultry eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans) were defined for the white population. To rank the participants by weekly red and processed-meat consumption based on the touch-screen, we summed the frequencies for processed meat, beef, pork, and lamb or mutton by using the following coding: “Never” = 0, “Less than once a week” = 0.5, “Once a week” = 1, “2–4 times a week” = 3, “5–6 times a week” = 5.5, and “Once or more daily” = 7. Regular meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating red (beef, lamb or mutton, or pork) or processed meat >3 times/wk, whereas low meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating red or processed meat =3 times/wk, regardless of what else they ate. Poultry eaters were defined as participants who reported never consuming any red or processed meat but who did eat poultry. Fish eaters were participants who reported that they never consumed any red meat, processed meat, or poultry but who ate oily or nonoily fish. Vegetarians were defined as participants who reported that they never consumed any meat or fish, and vegans were participants who reported that they never consumed any meat, fish, eggs or foods containing eggs, or dairy products.

Worldwide, more than 350 million individuals suffer from depression [1]. As a contributor to the burden of morbidity, it is ranked third globally and first in middle and high income countries, with morbidity expected to rise further [2]. In the United Kingdom alone, around 1 in 20 adults experience an episode of depression annually, and it is the third most common reason by patients to consult their general practitioner [3]. Major depression carries a significant economic and health burden [4, 5]. It is associated with increased physical comorbidity [6], reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [7], and impaired function in work, school and family life [8], as well as increased mortality [9], including suicides [10]. The prevalence of obesity is increasing both in the UK and worldwide [11], leading to suggestions of an “obesity pandemic” or “globesity”. As with depression, we know that adiposity is associated with reduced physical well-being [12], poor HRQoL [13–15], and higher societal costs [16].  The relationship between these two important public health problems has been the focus of an increasing number of studies over recent years, but these studies have produced inconsistent results [17, 18]. Some have reported positive associations [19] whilst others have reported negative [20] or no associations [21]. We previously showed that adiposity was significantly associated with poor overall HRQoL [13], but this was largely due to reductions in the physical component of HRQoL, with the mental component reduced only among morbidly obese and increased among overweight [14]. Furthermore, we found that poor mental health was confined to obese women under 45 years of age, and the apparent protective role of being overweight was confined to men aged 45–59 years [19].  A meta-analysis of population studies reported a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.26 (95% CI 1.17, 1.36) for the association between obesity and depression [22]. This association was only significant in women (OR 1.32). Of the 17 studies included, 16 used body mass index (BMI) as a measure of obesity. Another recent meta-analysis reported a pooled OR of 1.38 (95% CI 1.22, 1.57) for the association between central obesity and depression [23]. A total of 15 studies were included in this review, of which 14 used waist circumference (WC) as the measure of central obesity. Several studies showed that the association between obesity and depression is stronger in women [19, 24]. In contrast, a recent large study demonstrated that adiposity was a significant predictor of depression only in men [25].  In these two recent meta-analyses, most used self-reported adiposity measurements, and many were not adjusted for important potential confounders such as socio-economic status, physical comorbidity, and use of psychotropic medications. Only BMI and WC have been used as measures of adiposity, and they were simply dichotomized into obese and not obese, thereby losing information on the relationship across the spectrum of adiposity such as whether there is a dose relationship. There is some evidence that the relationship between adiposity and depression varies according to the level of adiposity [26] and that waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and body fat percentage (BF%) may also be associated with depression [27]. One recent, comparatively smaller German study (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>4907) examined the association between obesity and depression, using the continuous measure of BMI, WC and WHR but not the direct measurement of BF% [28]. Overall, there is a paucity of larger studies which used other than BMI measures in exploring this association.""","""The relationship between these two important public health problems has been the focus of an increasing number of studies over recent years, but these studies have produced inconsistent results [17,18].

It has long been known that reactivation of the PNS is the main contributor to interindividual HRR differences and that the effect of this reactivation is strongest in the first 30 seconds after termination of exercise.8 Despite this knowledge, HRR is commonly determined at 1 minute after termination of exercise.1, 3, 6 Recently, a study by McCrory et al9 described HRR within a 1-minute interval after an orthostatic challenge, and found that speed of HRR in the immediate 20 seconds was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality.

Introduction Fragility fractures, sarcopenia (the presence of low skeletal muscle mass and function), and frailty are becoming more prevalent in our aging society with their attendant disabilities and costs for health and social care. Moreover, maintaining mobility and wellbeing in our aging society is important. The costs of falls and fractures are £2.3 billion per year in the UK ($17 billion in the US), with one in two women and one in five men experiencing a fracture over the age of 50 years [1,2]. Estimates of the costs of sarcopenia are $US18.5B, and they are set to rise [3]. Osteoporosis (the presence of low bone density, BMD) is a well-recognised risk factor for fragility fractures [4,5,6,7], but more recently the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass, function and sarcopenia, as well as frailty, have also been recognised as risk factors for osteoporosis, falls, and fractures [6,7,8]. Skeletal muscle provides protection through hormonal or endocrine interactions between muscle and bone, muscle force generated mechanical signals, and maintenance of postural balance. So, conserving skeletal muscle mass and function is important for prevention of fractures [9,10,11]. Both osteoporosis and sarcopenia are highly prevalent. Estimates for the prevalence of osteoporosis in the community are 22.1% and 5.5% in European women and men, aged 50 years and over [1]. In the USA 77.1% of women and 10.0% of men, over the age of 65 years have either osteoporosis or low bone density [12]. Sarcopenia has been identified in between 1% and 29% in community dwelling people over the age of 60 years, with estimates for those living in long term care of between 14% and 33% [13,14]. Recent predictions for Europe estimate that the prevalence of sarcopenia will almost double overall in the elderly population to 22.3% by 2045 [13,14]. The prevalence of frailty is 25% in those over the age in 80 [12]. It is clear that the prevalence of all these conditions (osteoporosis, sarcopenia and frailty, and number of fractures) will rise in line with the increasing age of populations in the UK and USA, as will the costs of health and social care for their treatment [3,13,15,16]. Prior to a diagnosis of these conditions, gradual losses in bone density and skeletal muscle mass and strength (sarcopenic risk factors) occur in a continuum starting from the age 30 years, with increasing rates of loss in those over the age of 60 years [17,18]. Importantly, these conditions, once present, are difficult to reverse and current treatment strategies are limited. Therefore, maintaining skeletal muscle and bone health during aging is important in our populations, and new preventative strategies in middle and younger older ages (middle age 40–60 years, younger older age 60 to 70 years) are needed. Dietary composition can impact on the mechanisms leading to age-related loss of bone density, skeletal muscle mass or function. Calcium is well established as essential for bone health, as is protein for skeletal muscle, but other nutrients that are integral to bone and muscle physiology, such as magnesium (Mg), have not been investigated extensively and concurrently in relation to both skeletal muscle and bone health in both men and women of middle and younger older age [19,20,21,22,23]. The mechanism by which Mg may protect against osteoporosis and sarcopenic risk factors may be through the protection from cytokine induced stimulation of osteoclast activity or the protection of loss of skeletal muscle mass or strength. For osteoporosis, Mg can influence osteoblast activity as well as hydroxyapatite crystal formation, and regulation of calcium homeostasis through interactions between parathyroid hormone and vitamin D [24,25]. For skeletal muscle, Mg has direct physiological and metabolic roles, including maintenance of protein synthesis and turnover. Mg may also affect muscle performance though energy metabolism (production of ATP), transmembrane transport, and muscle contraction and relaxation [26,27]. Moreover, skeletal muscle and bone contain the majority of Mg in the body with 60% found in bone and 27% in muscle, indicating the importance of Mg to the musculoskeletal system [28]. Understanding the gender specific differences in associations between diet and skeletal muscle and bone health is important, as men attain a higher proportion of skeletal muscle mass, grip strength, and BMD at younger ages than women. Also, the effects of aging differ, with men losing a higher percentage of muscle mass and a lower percentage of BMD than women as they age. Few studies have investigated the sarcopenic risk factors with dietary magnesium in middle and older aged populations and even fewer investigated these associations according to gender. Grip strength has only been investigated in five previous studies with dietary or supplemental Mg intake or blood concentrations, and only one of these was in men [20,21,27,29,30]. Even fewer studies have investigated the associations between Mg and skeletal muscle mass, with none investigating associations in men only [20,21,29,30]. Of the greater number of studies investigating dietary magnesium and bone density, most were in older women (34), with only five investigating associations independently in men [25,31,32,33,34].""","""The mechanism by which Mg may protect against osteoporosis and sarcopenic risk factors may be through the protection from cytokine induced stimulation of osteoclast activity or the protection of loss of skeletal muscle mass or strength.""","Yes","Yes","""To our knowledge, no studies have previously investigated dietary Mg and measures of both bone and skeletal muscle health concurrently in the same cohort, independently in men and women.

Measurements of Body Composition Skeletal Muscle Mass, Grip Strength and Bone Density (Outcome Measures) Hand grip strength was measured using a Jamar J00105 hydraulic hand dynamometer with three measurements made on the left hand and 3 made on the right hand side, which were then averaged [36,37]. The higher of these two measurements was used in the analyses [36,37]. Height, weight, body composition and body mass index. Standing height was measured using a Seca 202 height measure. Total body weight and fat-free mass (FFM), measured with bioelectrical impedance, were measured using the Tanita BC 418MA Body Fat Analyser [38]. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height squared in metres. Indices of fat free mass. In order to control for increases in FFM with height and weight, the following indices were used [39]. Firstly, FFM as a percentage of body weight (FFM%), was calculated as total FFM (in kg divided by total body weight (in kg) multiplied by 100). Secondly, FFM divided by BMI (FFMBMI) was calculated since this takes into account the increase in body size, scaled for height, and it was calculated as total FFM divided by BMI [40]. Thirdly, total appendicular lean mass (ALM) was used because skeletal muscle mass in the limbs is more directly related to issues of mobility and the onset of sarcopenia was calculated as the sum of FFM in the arms and legs. ALM was scaled by BMI (ALMBMI) calculated as ALM divided by BMI [40]. Bone Mineral Density. The Sahara Clinical Bone Sonometer was used to estimate bone mineral density (BMD) based on ultrasound measurement of the calcaneus (heel) [41]. In the early stages of recruitment, only a single heel was used for the measurement, but in the later stages, measurements were made on both heels. The average of the two heel estimates was used in this study if both were available; otherwise, the single value was used (0.71% (n = 545) of the measurements that were used in our analyses were made the left had side only, and 0.76% (n = 581) of measurements were made on the right hand side only).""","Section 2.2 Measurements of Body Composition Skeletal Muscle Mass, Grip Strength and Bone Density (Outcome Measures)","Yes","Yes","""2.3. Measurement of Magnesium Intake Dietary intake was assessed using the Oxford WebQ, a computerised 24-h recall questionnaire that was self-completed online on up to five occasions [42,43]. This questionnaire was designed to be completed on multiple occasions to reduce the potential measurement error that may occur with a single 24-h recall measurement. The Oxford WebQ questionnaire consists of 200 food items with associated choices of standard portion units or portion sizes [42,43]. This questionnaire has been validated against an interviewer-administered 24-h recall, with only small differences being found between the intakes of nutrients using both methods [43]. Intakes of nutrients from this questionnaire were calculated using composition data taken from McCance and Widdowson’s The Composition of Food and its supplements [43]. The Oxford WebQ was built in to the baseline assessments for the last 70,724 Biobank participants, and participants with a known e-mail address (66% of the cohort) were invited to complete it at a further four different time points over a 16-month interval at times designed to cover different week days and weekend days as well as seasonal variation [42].

Measurement of Confounding Variables Other variables included in the analysis were age group (39–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–72) and smoking status (never, previous/prefer not to say, or current). We calculated metabolic equivalents (METs) as the excess metabolic equivalent MET hours/week of physical activity during work and leisure time, as described in [44], and grouped participants into low (0 to <10 excess METs), moderate (10 to <50 excess METs) or high (=50 excess METs) levels of physical activity. Energy, calcium, and vitamin D intakes from food were calculated as the average across the questionnaires that were completed. Protein intake was calculated as the percentage of average total energy intake from protein, and the models were adjusted for sex-specific quintiles of this. Binary variables for Mg, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation were derived from questions on supplement taking, including multivitamins and minerals. If a participant had answered that they had taken a relevant supplement on any of the food questionnaires, then this was coded as “yes”. To estimate potential misreporting of diet, the ratio of reported energy intake (EI) to estimated energy expenditure (EER) (EI:EER ratio), was calculated and adjusted for in the analyses [45]. The EER was calculated based on equations for men or women aged 19 years and older from the US Dietary Reference Intakes, and these equations were applied according to the BMI of participants; greater or less than 25 kg/m2 [45]. The equations used take into account age, height, and weight, as well as physical activity [45].

Measurements of Body Composition Skeletal Muscle Mass, Grip Strength and Bone Density (Outcome Measures) Hand grip strength was measured using a Jamar J00105 hydraulic hand dynamometer with three measurements made on the left hand and 3 made on the right hand side, which were then averaged [36,37]. The higher of these two measurements was used in the analyses [36,37]. Height, weight, body composition and body mass index. Standing height was measured using a Seca 202 height measure. Total body weight and fat-free mass (FFM), measured with bioelectrical impedance, were measured using the Tanita BC 418MA Body Fat Analyser [38]. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height squared in metres. Indices of fat free mass. In order to control for increases in FFM with height and weight, the following indices were used [39]. Firstly, FFM as a percentage of body weight (FFM%), was calculated as total FFM (in kg divided by total body weight (in kg) multiplied by 100). Secondly, FFM divided by BMI (FFMBMI) was calculated since this takes into account the increase in body size, scaled for height, and it was calculated as total FFM divided by BMI [40]. Thirdly, total appendicular lean mass (ALM) was used because skeletal muscle mass in the limbs is more directly related to issues of mobility and the onset of sarcopenia was calculated as the sum of FFM in the arms and legs. ALM was scaled by BMI (ALMBMI) calculated as ALM divided by BMI [40]. Bone Mineral Density. The Sahara Clinical Bone Sonometer was used to estimate bone mineral density (BMD) based on ultrasound measurement of the calcaneus (heel) [41]. In the early stages of recruitment, only a single heel was used for the measurement, but in the later stages, measurements were made on both heels. The average of the two heel estimates was used in this study if both were available; otherwise, the single value was used (0.71% (n = 545) of the measurements that were used in our analyses were made the left had side only, and 0.76% (n = 581) of measurements were made on the right hand side only). 2.3. Measurement of Magnesium Intake Dietary intake was assessed using the Oxford WebQ, a computerised 24-h recall questionnaire that was self-completed online on up to five occasions [42,43]. This questionnaire was designed to be completed on multiple occasions to reduce the potential measurement error that may occur with a single 24-h recall measurement. The Oxford WebQ questionnaire consists of 200 food items with associated choices of standard portion units or portion sizes [42,43]. This questionnaire has been validated against an interviewer-administered 24-h recall, with only small differences being found between the intakes of nutrients using both methods [43]. Intakes of nutrients from this questionnaire were calculated using composition data taken from McCance and Widdowson’s The Composition of Food and its supplements [43]. The Oxford WebQ was built in to the baseline assessments for the last 70,724 Biobank participants, and participants with a known e-mail address (66% of the cohort) were invited to complete it at a further four different time points over a 16-month interval at times designed to cover different week days and weekend days as well as seasonal variation [42]. Thus the Oxford WebQ was completed up to five times by participants. For those who completed it more than once (between two and five times), mean values of Mg intake were calculated. Of the individuals that were included in our analyses, 62% had completed more than one 24-hour recall. For the individuals used in this study, the maximum difference across months of the year for Mg was 2%, indicating minimal seasonal variation in the intakes of this nutrient. For this analysis, sex-specific quintiles of average Mg intake were used. 2.4. Measurement of Confounding Variables Other variables included in the analysis were age group (39–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–72) and smoking status (never, previous/prefer not to say, or current). We calculated metabolic equivalents (METs) as the excess metabolic equivalent MET hours/week of physical activity during work and leisure time, as described in [44], and grouped participants into low (0 to <10 excess METs), moderate (10 to <50 excess METs) or high (=50 excess METs) levels of physical activity. Energy, calcium, and vitamin D intakes from food were calculated as the average across the questionnaires that were completed. Protein intake was calculated as the percentage of average total energy intake from protein, and the models were adjusted for sex-specific quintiles of this. Binary variables for Mg, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation were derived from questions on supplement taking, including multivitamins and minerals. If a participant had answered that they had taken a relevant supplement on any of the food questionnaires, then this was coded as “yes”. To estimate potential misreporting of diet, the ratio of reported energy intake (EI) to estimated energy expenditure (EER) (EI:EER ratio), was calculated and adjusted for in the analyses [45]. The EER was calculated based on equations for men or women aged 19 years and older from the US Dietary Reference Intakes, and these equations were applied according to the BMI of participants; greater or less than 25 kg/m2 [45].

Loss of skeletal muscle can occur during the loss of body weight and also in certain conditions of chronic disease e.g., respiratory disease, diabetes, and chronic renal failure [46,47,48]. To test whether our analyses were affected by the loss of body weight that was linked to the presence of chronic illness, we performed a sensitivity analysis by dropping individuals from the study if they answered yes to both of two questions: (1) whether individuals had seen a weight change compared to a year ago and (2) whether they had a long-standing illness, disability or infirmity n = 7730. We then repeated the analyses on this smaller dataset (n = 148,845).""","Section 2.2 Measurements of Body Composition Skeletal Muscle Mass, Grip Strength and Bone Density (Outcome Measures); Section 2.3.

The number of dietary questionnaires completed was included as a covariate in analyses, as was self-reported use of cholesterol-lowering medication, and HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) use and menopausal status for women. 2.5. Study Participants The Biobank dataset consisted of 502,655 people, however we excluded the following (see Figure 1): those without dietary or other relevant missing data, non-white ethnicity, pregnant women, those with a grip strength of zero, those with extremes of FFM, BMD, Mg, energy, protein, EI:EER, or BMI (bioelectrical impedance measures are considered unreliable at BMI extremes) [38]. These exclusions left a total of 156,575 people in the study (73,323 men and 82,098 women in the muscle analyses, 36,118 men and 40,441 women in the BMD analysis).  2.6. Statistical Analysis We examined the association between dietary Mg, skeletal muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density using multivariable regression techniques. First, for men and women separately, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of each outcome variable for each sex-specific quintile of dietary Mg (model 1). Then, we fitted Mg quintiles as the predictor in an adjusted model, again for men and women separately, with the covariates included. For this adjusted model, we calculated adjusted means with standard errors of each outcome for each sex-specific quintile of dietary Mg (model 2). For both models, we tested for a trend (p value given as p trend in the tables) in these unadjusted (model 1) and adjusted (model 2) values by fitting the median value of the outcome variable within each quintile as a continuous variable. Model 2 was also adjusted for sex-specific quintile of percentage energy from protein, smoking status, age group, physical activity levels, dietary energy intake, the ratio of EI:EER, the number of food questionnaires completed, whether the participant took Mg supplements, and, for women, whether the participant took HRT and whether she had experienced menopause. For the measures of skeletal muscle mass and strength, we also adjusted for whether the participant had taken cholesterol-lowering drugs. For BMD, we also adjusted for BMI, dietary calcium, dietary vitamin D, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. For grip strength, we additionally adjusted for height. To determine whether there might be a different relationship between Mg and the outcomes of interest by age, we repeated the analyses stratified by age (<60 years and =60 years). Loss of skeletal muscle can occur during the loss of body weight and also in certain conditions of chronic disease e.g., respiratory disease, diabetes, and chronic renal failure [46,47,48]. To test whether our analyses were affected by the loss of body weight that was linked to the presence of chronic illness, we performed a sensitivity analysis by dropping individuals from the study if they answered yes to both of two questions: (1) whether individuals had seen a weight change compared to a year ago and (2) whether they had a long-standing illness, disability or infirmity n = 7730. We then repeated the analyses on this smaller dataset (n = 148,845). To understand the association between total fat free mass and total appendicular lean mass, the correlation was calculated in men and women. In order to compare the relative scale of the associations between Mg intake and the different indices of skeletal muscle and bone, the differences in the values for these outcomes, between the top and bottom quintiles of Mg intake, were calculated as a percentage as follows; the difference between quintile 5 and quintile 1 of the values for the outcome indices were calculated and the percentage difference calculated as a percentage of the value of quintile 1.

This is important as these factors are associated with an increased risk of falls, frailty, sarcopenia, and fractures. Higher intakes of dietary Mg were positively associated with a greater grip strength, indices of skeletal muscle mass, and BMD in both men and women aged 39–72 years continuously across the distribution of intakes. The inter-quintile differences associated with dietary Mg ranged from 1.1% and 2.4% for grip strength to 5.1% and 5.5% for FFMBMI, in men and women, respectively, but were smaller for BMD being 2.9% and 0.9%. When comparing these differences with previously measured longitudinal annual losses of skeletal muscle mass, grip strength and bone density, the associations found across the distribution of Mg intake ranged from one quarter in men to three quarters in women, for grip strength, and from 3 times in men to 5.1 times in women for FFM%. For BMD, these comparisons were 1.9 times in women and 9.7 times in men. Moreover, the associations were in the main of a similar scale in younger, as well as older, men and women, indicating that dietary Mg has relevance for protection for skeletal muscle and bone outcomes both in middle and younger older age groups. In men over the age of 60 years, the interquintile differences found in grip strength were around twice that of younger men. Whilst these findings are cross-sectional, they indicate that it is likely to be important for older men to consume sufficient dietary magnesium. Our findings were also significant after statistical adjustment for the important factors that contribute to skeletal muscle and bone loss: Age, smoking, and physical activity, and in women, HRT medication. For skeletal muscle our results remained significant after adjustment for dietary protein, which has been traditionally regarded as the most important nutrient for skeletal muscle health. For bone density, we also accounted for dietary and supplemental intakes of calcium. Thus, our results are independent of protein for muscle and of calcium for bone which have well established structural and physiological roles for musculoskeletal health.

Body composition was measured with BIA, which is considered as less precise than measurements made with DXA, although BIA is regarded as accurate in healthy individuals [56,60]. However, the method used for this study is single frequency BIA and so may underestimate the loss of skeletal muscle mass as compared with measurements made with multi-frequency BIA [61].

Studies have found an association between objectively assessed walking pace and mortality, mostly in older adult,5–7 with other studies suggesting self-reported walking pace may act as an important marker of cardiovascular health.8,9 Thus, self-reported walking pace could function as a pragmatic measure of physical fitness and a simple index of mortality risk. However, in order to have clinical and public health relevance, research is needed to examine the extent to which pragmatic self-reported measures of walking pace are associated with cardiorespiratory fitness and whether the associations with all-cause and cause-specific mortality are maintained after adjustment for potential confounding variables or vary across potential effect modifiers such as age, smoking status, or body mass index (BMI).  Muscle strength is also an important and reproducible measure of physical fitness and has been associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.2 Handgrip strength is correlated with overall muscle strength and is associated with functional and health outcomes including frailty, falls, nutritional status and mortality.10–15 Investigating whether associations persist after adjustment for other pragmatic measures of physical fitness, such as walking pace, and maintained across potential effect modifiers will further help elucidate the potential clinical importance of handgrip strength within the general population.""","""Studies have found an association between objectively assessed walking pace and mortality, mostly in older adult,5–7 with other studies suggesting self-reported walking pace may act as an important marker of cardiovascular health...Handgrip strength is correlated with overall muscle strength and is associated with functional and health outcomes including frailty, falls, nutritional status and mortality""","Yes","Yes","""Investigating whether associations persist after adjustment for other pragmatic measures of physical fitness, such as walking pace, and maintained across potential effect modifiers will further help elucidate the potential clinical importance of handgrip strength within the general population.""","""research is needed to examine the extent to which pragmatic self-reported measures of walking pace are associated with cardiorespiratory fitness and whether the associations with allcause and cause-specific mortality are maintained after adjustment for potential confounding variables or vary across potential effect modifiers such as age, smoking status, or body mass index (BMI)...Investigating whether associations persist after adjustment for other pragmatic measures of physical fitness, such as walking pace, and maintained across potential effect modifiers will further help elucidate the potential clinical importance of handgrip strength within the general population","""The aim of this analysis was to quantify the associations of self-reported walking pace and handgrip strength with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in men and women from UK Biobank and to investigate whether associations are maintained across categories of age, BMI, and smoking status.""","""The aim of this analysis was to quantify the associations of selfreported walking pace and handgrip strength with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in men and women from UK Biobank and to investigate whether associations are maintained across categories of age, BMI, and smoking status""","Yes","Yes","Methods start on page 2","""UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort of middle-aged adults designed to support biomedical analysis focused on improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic disease.""","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","""UK Biobank This analysis used data from 502<U+2009>639 participants within UK Biobank, the methods and aim of which have been reported elsewhere.16 In brief, UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort of middle-aged adults designed to support biomedical analysis focused on improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic disease.

Walking pace was assessed by the following single item question: ‘How would you describe your usual walking pace? (i) Slow pace, (ii) Steady/average pace, and (iii) Brisk pace’ (DF 924). Handgrip strength was assessed through the use of a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Jamar J00105) while sitting (DF 46 and 47). The elbow of the arm holding the dynamometer was placed against the side of the body and bent to a 90° angle with the forearm placed on an armrest. Participants were instructed to squeeze the handle of the dynamometer as hard as they could for 3<U+2009>s. Both left and right hand strengths were measured. The values for the right and left hand were summed and divided by 2 to estimate an average.  Cardiorespiratory fitness A subsample of UK Biobank undertook a 6<U+2009>min graded submaximal fitness test on a cycle ergometer (DF 6025). We utilized data from this subsample to inform the main analyses by investigating the association of cardiorespiratory fitness with walking pace and handgrip strength. The start and end workload of the graded fitness test was set according to age, height, weight, resting heart rate, and sex to ensure a similar relative intensity across the population. Heart rate was monitored before, during, and after the exercise test via a four-lead electrocardiogram. Maximal cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated by: (i) Fitting a linear regression line between heart rate and power output for each stage of the test; (ii) The regression line was extrapolated to the age-predicted maximal heart rate with the formula 208<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.7<U+2009>×<U+2009>age18; (iii) Maximal oxygen uptake was estimated from the regression equation for the relationship between work rate (power) and oxygen uptake [oxygen uptake (mL·kg-1·min-1)<U+2009>=<U+2009>7<U+2009>+<U+2009>[10.8<U+2009>×<U+2009>work rate (Watts)]/body mass (kg)].19 Individuals without cancer and cardiovascular disease who completed at least one stage of the fitness test were included for this sub-analysis (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>51<U+2009>282).
