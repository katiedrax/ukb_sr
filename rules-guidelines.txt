Title: General guidelines for resolving conflicts in the data extraction form

These rules are to resolve conflicts not to collect new data so they're directed what consistently we coded.

# Dependencies

Certain items are dependent on each other. 
Meaning that if these change during conflict resolution it may create conflicts in items that came after them in the form.

* 1b_ii and 4 - If 1b_ii is "Yes" then 4 will be "Yes" because methods would have been fully described in abstract. 
* 7_v, 12b_i, and 17_i - These items apply if subgroup analyses done. We defined effect modifiers as terms used in subgroup analyses or interactions but this is not how STROBE seem to do it

# General guidelines

* 9 - is just binary, don't use partially because we it's a very subjective judgement of what discussion of bias would be partial. Instead we just made a judgement of if discussion was present or not
* 11_ii & 11_iii - KD used unsure/Partially when no/some groupings defined but unclear if variables were grouped. All other coders evaluated the completeness of reporting for stated groupings/catergories so did not use "unsure". We used this rule because it is the one the majority of coders used. KD simply reassessed her "Partially" or "unsure" judgements based on uncertainty of whether any other groups existed in line with the majority interpretation then resolved conflicts. 
* 5_iv - RR & MG initally said no because don't give dates for when people self-reported their exposure. 
BW said no throughout for the same reason
Mark, Becky & I later interpreted it as date baseline assessments done. 
We also agreed that "Partially" could be assigned to statements of measurements made at "baseline" 
* 12d - complete case analysis is not a way of addressing loss to follow up.
It's more about have they run a competeing risk model & censoring based on loss to follow up
* 19_ii - authors need to say how stuff would bias it e.g. this could be biased up to 20%
* 11_i - We are going to assume that variables were handled as they were measured unless otherwise stated (i.e. duplicate of 8starred_ii)
** 8starred_ii and 11_i will not necessarily be duplicates e.g. authors could distinuish between handling and measurement and fully explain how they handled variables (11b_i == Yes) but not how those variables were measured (8starred_ii != Yes) 
* We considered results to be "Partially" reported if authors did not give exact p-values, unless p <.001
* 12e & 17_iii - we treated all interactions as interactions not sensitivity analyses

# Duplicates

Some items are duplicates of each other. 
Meaning that in the case of observational epidemiological studies using UK Biobank data, these items refered to the same information.
All duplicated items that came after the first duplicate item in the data extraction form will be "NA". 

We believe some items could be considered as duplicates but our interpretation meant that they were not.

* 6a_i, 5a, & 6a_ii - we took "recruitment sites or sources" in 5a to mean recruitment into UKB, took 6a_i "eligibility criteria...group from which study population was selected" to mean inclusion in the analysis, and in 6a_ii we took "source to mean mean sources of participants (i.e. statement of UK BIobank). Different from "setting" question because that we took to mean the setting of the UK Biobank itself
* 13starredb - not duplicate as it is a justifcations for why numbers went down
* 6a_ii & 8starred_i - we initially treated these as duplicates. "source" was not defined in STROBE E&E so KD & MG initally interpreted as sources of data, this made 8starred_i a duplicate of 6a_ii because source for each variable would be "UK Biobank", later had to reassess this because we reinterpretted it to mean sources of each variable interms of method of measurement (self-completed questionnaire, interview, clinician measurement). This meant 6a_ii was the only item to cover a statement of the data being from the UK Biobank
