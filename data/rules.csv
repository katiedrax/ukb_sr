"Rule = ""Partially"" if ""longitudinal"" referred to","Describing a study as a ""longitudinal"" is not sufficient according to the STROBE guidelines but it still gives some indication",Partially,s1a ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""baseline"" not enough for search so marked as No","One coder marked ""baseline"" as an indication of study design but we agreed this was not",No,s1a ,,,,,,,

Rule = partially have either recruitment details or states its from the UK Biobank but not both,"A ""Yes"" for this item demands authors state the study uses the UK Biobank and explains recruitment to the UK Biobank. Missing either yields a ""Partially""",Partially,s5_i ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""Yes"" if state how ""invited"", or ""NHS register""","Explaining the recruitment to the UK Biobank is sufficient if authors explain how people were ""invited"" or that they used an NHS register",Yes,s5_i ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""Partially"" if say ""general population""","Although not ideal explaining people were recruited from the ""general population"" gives some idea of the recruitment population",Partially,s5_i ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""Partially"" if state exposures were measured at baseline but don't give dates of baseline measurements","Stating which variables are ""baseline"", even without dates, gives some indication of a timeline so yields a ""Partially""",Partially,s5_iv ,,,,,,,
Rule = Yes if any follow-up date,"Authors only need to provide one follow up date, even if there may be more. This is to make it easier and faster to assess this item and resolve conflicts",Yes,s5_v ,,,,,,,
Rule = NA if cross-sectional,"There were some conflicts over the applicability of the item for cross-sectional studies. For ease, we agreed follow-up dates are not applicable for cross-sectional studies.",NA,s5_v ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""NA"" because duplicate","6a_iii and 10 are duplicates of 6a_i. We took 6a_i to mean inclusion in the analysis and took 6a_iii to mean methods of selection into the analysis, which is the same thing. 10 is a duplicate of 6a_i and 6a_iii because all included studies are not novel studies so eligbility criteria covered by 6a_i is justification for sample size. All of which are the same thing. 5_vi is a duplicate of 5_iii, 5_iv, and 5_v because we took ""dates of data collection"" to mean if they included all dates for exposure/outcome, recruitment, beginning & end of follow-up (if used) all of which is covered by the other items.",NA,s5_vi,s6a_iii_cc,s6a_iii_coh_cs,s10,,,,
Rule = Partially if don't give name of follow-up data source,"They must give the exact name of the follow-up data source. For example, ""cancer registries"" is ""Partially""",Partially,s6a_iv_coh ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""Yes"" if define outcomes but missing ICD criteria",They do not need to give ICD criteria as part of the outcome definition because it is covered by 7_vi,Yes,s7_i ,,,,,,,
"Rule = go with conservative estimate ""Partially"" because hard to resolve if other person looked less so would require extensive checking and debate","These are dense items that cover a large amount of information. For example if one coder missed just one variable and the other didn't then we have a not-Yes-""Yes"" conflict. Given the volume of these conflicts we resolved them by taking the more conservative estimate",Partially,s7_i ,s7_ii ,s7_iii ,s7_iv ,s7_vi ,s8starred_ii ,s12a ,s14starreda  
"Rule = go with conservative estimate ""Partially-External"" because hard to resolve if other person looked less so would require extensive checking and debate","These are dense items that cover a large amount of information. For example if one coder missed just one variable and the other didn't then we have a not-Yes-""Yes"" conflict.

"Rule = ""NA"" if subgroup analyses are the main analysis as this is covered by other items","Some coders classed the main analyses as a subgroup analysis, making this item applicable, when we agreed it is not applicable.",NA,s7_v ,s12b_i ,,,,,,
Rule = NA if BMI because not a disease outcome,"Some coders classed BMI as a disease outcome, making this item applicable, when we agreed it is not applicable.",NA,s7_vi ,,,,,,,
Rule = Partially-External if ICD-10 codes given but not ICD diagnostic criteria,ICD-10 code diagnostic criteria are widely known and publicly available. So even if authors do not state where the diagnostic criteria can be found stating the ICD-10 codes is sufficient to tell readers where to find the information,Partially-External,s7_vi ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""NA"" for all studies because everyone had same assessment",Comparability of assessment methods if same for all articles because they come from the same dataset so item isn't applicable,NA,s8starred_iii ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""Partially"" if missing statistical tests and don't say how interaction incoroporated into model",Item partially reported if authors state interaction analysis conducted but missing how,Partially,s12b_ii ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""Partially"" if some missing data explained but not clearly for all variables",Partially reported if item only reported for some variables,Partially,s12c ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""NA"" if include all eligible participants because no sampling strategy used",It is feasible that researchers could take a random or specific sample of the UK Biobank to analyse. If they did not do this then the item is not applicable,NA,12d_cs,,,,,,,
Rule = NA if no checks on robustness of results,"It is possible this item could be always be considered applicable if coders expect sensitivity analysis however, unless authors state they conducted them then this item is not applicable",NA,s12e ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""Yes"" if give numbers in UKB, eligible and included","We considered reporting the exact numbers in the UK biobank, eligible and included to be sufficient",Yes,s13starreda ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""NA"" if complete case analysis",A complete case analysis means no missing data and therefore the item isn't applicable.,NA,s14starredb ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""Partially"" if state excluded some variables because had missing data but don't indicate number of missing data for remaining variables",We agreed that stating any variables they excluded missing data from constitutes indirectly indicating the (absence) of missing data for the those variables at least,Partially,s14starredb ,,,,,,,
Rule = Yes if give any of mean/range/total,Mean/range/total follow-up time is sufficient,Yes,s14starredc ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""Yes"" if give number of outcome events, don't need rate too",The STROBE item says number or summary measures over time so one or the other is sufficient,Yes,s15starred_coh ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""Partially"" if make blanket statement about how covariates were chosen because associated with outcomes",We considered a generic statement about all covariates and not one specific to explaining why each variable was included to be insufficient,Partially,s16a_v ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""Partially"" if missing Townsend quintile boundaries, but name other boundaries",Authors frequently reported using Townsend quintiles but didn't provide boundaries. Coders also sometimes overlooked this ommission,Partially,s16b,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""NA"" if not a binary outcome",Cannot be calculated if binary outcome,NA,s16c ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""NA"" for case-controls",Cannot be calculated if case-control,NA,s16c ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""Yes""if only p-value or significance indicated for interaction",p-value alone considered sufficient,Yes,s17_ii ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""Yes"" if give a numerical estimation of magnitude & direction for at least 1 source of bias",We considered giving a numerical estimation of direction and magnitude of bias to be best practice for this item. Doing so for one source of bias would be sufficient,Yes,s19_ii ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""Partially"" if give non-numerical estimation of magnitude & or direction for at least 1 source of bias","Giving a non-numerical estimation of direction and/or magnitude of bias for one source of bias is at least ""Partially""",Partially,s19_ii ,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""No"" if do not give non-numerical estimation of magnitude or direction for any source of bias",An absence of any attempt to provide this information,No,s19_ii ,,,,,,,
Rule = Partially if make policy recommendations,"Policy recommendations we didn't consider as ""not cautious"" as strong causal statements but still not enough to be considered a ""Yes""",Partially,s20,,,,,,,
"Rule = ""No"" if make very strong causal statement or policy recommendation","Overall interpretations were sometimes not ""cautious"" in that they made causal statements and/or policy recommendations based on their one study result. ",No,s20,,,,,,,
