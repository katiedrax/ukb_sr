funding_text 1={The UK Biobank is reasonably representative of the general population in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status but is unrepresentative in terms of lifestyle ( 40 ). Therefore, caution is needed in generalizing summary statistics to the general population, but estimates of the magnitude of the associations are, nevertheless, generalizable. Participants were more likely to be older, to be women, and to live in less socioeconomically deprived areas; were less likely to be obese, to smoke, or to drink alcohol on a daily basis; and had fewer self-reported health outcomes. Rates of all-cause mortality and incidence of cancer were also lower ( 41,42 ). This does not detract from the ability to generalize estimates of the magnitude of associations. Our study benefited from a very large number of participants, recruited from the general population, across the whole of the United Kingdom. We had sufficient power to undertake subgroup analyses by sex, which overcomes limitations from previous evidence. Reverse causality is possible in any observational study; however, when participants with existing disease diagnosed at baseline were removed from the analysis, the associations remained significant. Moreover, our results were broadly similar after a landmark analysis was conducted removing all events that occurred within the first 2 yr of follow up. Walking pace was self-reported and, to our knowledge, the question used has not previously been validated. Although prevalent disease and comorbidities at baseline were self-reported, these self-reports were of physician diagnosed disease. In conclusion, the current data have demonstrated that, irrespective of total walking time, a faster walking pace is associated with lower risk of a wide range of health outcomes. The findings require determination of causality in appropriately designed trials, but could have important implications for physical activity recommendations. They tentatively imply guidelines should encourage people to increase their walking pace (if low to begin with), rather than simply focusing on total time spent walking. As lack of time is the most commonly cited barrier to increasing activity levels; brisk walking of shorter duration may be easier to accommodate into busy schedules and the benefits may be greatest among those failing to meet the current recommendations. The authors are grateful to UK Biobank participants. This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource under Application Number 7155. The UK Biobank was supported by the Wellcome Trust, Medical Research Council, Department of Health, Scottish Government and the Northwest Regional Development Agency.

funding_text 1={In a large and diverse population cohort, we have shown that exposure to ready-to-eat food environments was associated with higher odds of type 2 diabetes. These results remained robust after adjustments for risk factors and covariates. Adjustments for activity-related outcomes, including MET-h/week of physical activity, slightly attenuated the effect estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale analysis of the association between exposure to ready-to-eat food environments that sell food for instant consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes in the UK. We showed an 11% higher odds of type 2 diabetes among participants in the category with the highest exposure to ready-to-eat food within a 1-km street catchment area versus those with null exposure, after adjustments for all other risk factors and covariates. Our findings corroborate previous findings on the topic. A UK study 24 that used primary care data regarding 10 461 participants from three diabetes screening studies reported significantly increased odds of type 2 diabetes with a higher number of fast food outlets within a 500-m circular area (OR 1·02, 95% CI 1·00–1·04; p=0·02). However, this was an ecological study in which participants' areas were only geocoded up to a postcode-level. The Jackson Heart study, 22 an African-American population cohort of 3670 participants in the USA found that the density of unhealthy food stores within a 1-mile area of participants' residential addresses was associated with a 34% higher incidence of type 2 diabetes (1·34, 1·12–1·60). A Swedish study 23 based on 2·8 million adults from several national registries reported that the net negative food environment (measured as the ratio of health-harming food outlets to the food outlets per km 2 ) was associated with higher odds of type 2 diabetes (2·11, 1·57–2·82), with relatively higher effect estimates in participants who moved to neighbourhoods with greater relative access to health-harming food outlets. However, the Swedish study was an aggregate-level analysis, since the participants' dwelling could only be geocoded at the level of small geographical units (that averaged 1000 participants per unit) and failed to adjust for key confounders, such as physical activity. Another county-level ecological study 29 that used self-reported data in South Carolina, USA, reported no association between density of food outlets and county-level type 2 diabetes, subsequent to all adjustments. Our composite exposure measure of ready-to-eat food environments was validated from the results of fully adjusted models run with SFEVs ( table 2 ), which reported harmful effects of the highest category of exposure to restaurants and cafeterias. Models that used density of SFEVs reported higher odds of type 2 diabetes across higher categories of SFEVs of restaurants and cafeterias. Models that evaluated the association of street distance to the nearest food outlet with prevalence of type 2 diabetes found a 7–16% lower odds of type 2 diabetes among participants in the quintile representing the farthest distance versus those in the closest quintile. Previous studies 32,41 have consistently reported similar protective effects upon obesity with distance decay. Our findings might indicate an unhealthy access–unhealthy consumption mechanism. Previous research 42 has established positive associations between access to food environments and frequency of dining. Another study 43 found an association between mean daily energy intake and frequency of consumption of out-of-home meals, reporting a greater energy intake of 75–104 kcal/day among participants who ate meals out at least weekly compared with those who rarely ate out. Higher odds of type 2 diabetes among populations with greater access to ready-to-eat food environments might be a result of consumption behaviour, although we did not have the data on eating behaviour to confirm whether such behaviour is supply-side induced. Our models that explored interaction effects were significant only in the case of BMI; we found significantly greater effects across higher categories of composite ready-to-eat food exposure in overweight participants. This finding could be attributed to the fact that being overweight or obese is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The finding that the effect estimates were higher in female participants than male participants could indicate that women have a greater usage of residential neighbourhoods and a higher likelihood of being affected by ready-to-eat food environments within them. Our study has several strengths. The study relied on a very large and well characterised cohort that represents participants from 21 major cities of the UK with considerable diversity in their population-level characteristics and food environment exposures. Large-scale analyses gave a high level of statistical power to detect effects. In contrast to previous studies, ready-to-eat food environment was measured in a way that included not only fast food outlets but also pubs and bars and restaurants and cafeterias, which also supply food and drinks for instant consumption. Given the shifts in our food consumption behaviour, the health aspects of these neighbourhood food environments are of considerable significance because of their potential to supply food of high calorific value that is rich in saturated fat, salt, sugar, and other components that are detrimental to health. Our results remain consistent across the models of SFEVs and CFEV, and in our continuous models that used log-transformed CFEV. Our measures of density within 1-km individual street catchment areas (which were expressed as outlet units/km 2 ) are more useful than just counts, especially in informing policies aimed at provision of food outlets per unit area of urban space and, thus, optimising access to them (for example, restricting access to health-harming food environments). Density per km 2 is a measure of opportunity to purchase ready-to-eat food and drink. We were also able to use street distances to the nearest food outlet, another measure of opportunity, as a secondary variable for further sensitivity analyses, to validate our primary findings. In contrast to previous studies, 44 we have modelled outlets within functional catchment areas of geocoded dwellings, and thus we have enhanced the accuracy of exposure assessment (compared with exposures measured within predefined administrative neighbourhoods). Similarly, the application of street network catchment areas (as opposed to Euclidean buffers) enhances the accuracy of exposure assessment. 45 We could measure the association between street distance to the nearest food environment and odds of type 2 diabetes and we found protective trends of increasing distance to restaurants and cafeterias and hot and cold takeaways from dwelling location (representing an increasing opportunity to purchase). Among the study limitations, our study is an observational study of cross-sectional design, which presents the typical difficulties for causal inference. It is likely that participants with a preference for specific foods might have self-selected neighbourhoods with high densities of outlets that sell such food (demand-side ecological effect). Alternatively, food retailers might have established themselves in areas of high demand (supply-side ecological effect). The UK Biobank represents a stable population. In our analytic sample, 67·8% of the participants had resided in the current address for 10 years or more, and they had a mean duration of residence of 17·5 years (SD 11·6); we could find no modification of the effects by the duration of residence. Future studies should develop prospective health and exposure data for a more reliable evidence base. As with any study that uses secondary spatial data, error in the measurement of food environment could emerge from factors such as data incompleteness and temporal mismatch. The food environment metrics were derived from secondary spatial data sourced from OSGB. OSGB's food environment data were obtained from Royal Mail, local authorities, and other reliable private agencies and updated at periodic intervals. In our study, the food environment data were obtained during the end of the baseline phase of the UK Biobank, to avoid temporal mismatch. A second source of bias might emerge from potential exposure misclassification within the spatial dataset. A third possibility of bias emerges from the limitation of the food-related spatial data within the OSGB database that are available to this study. We were unable to account for the whole range of food environments; for example, our study did not adjust for variation in access to processed meals, sugary drinks, and alcohol served by supermarkets. We note that, as early as the late 1990s, supermarket supply in the UK was becoming saturated 46 and that fierce competition between the big suppliers has continued the trend. This trend means that, in urban areas of similar population density, access to a supermarket will be roughly constant. The use of density of petrol-filling stations and train and bus stations or terminals could, to a certain extent, act as a proxy for population density and, more generally, it represents urban hubs around which food-related retail and supermarkets tend to cluster. We also note that most large supermarkets invariably have petrol-filling stations adjacent to them. Our study is therefore a focused analysis of the association between accessibility to three distinct separate ready-to-eat food environments (pubs and bars, restaurants and cafeterias, and hot and cold takeaways that sell food for instant consumption) and type 2 diabetes, adjusting for petrol-filling stations and train and bus stations or terminals, which acted as a proxy for ambient availability of processed meals (such as those through supermarkets). Future studies might seek to adjust for a more holistic range of food outlets and for data on frequency of visits and heterogeneity in the type and nutritional value of food sold or served in each food outlet via detailed food audits, which the present national-level study could not do because of inadequate data. Beyond accessibility to retail food outlets, our study could not adjust for other factors that affect market behaviour, such as food pricing. As with any observational data, the risk of residual confounding cannot be ruled out in our study. We could test for potential residual confounding by running negative control analyses of birthweight, which produced no effects, as expected. Finally, the UK Biobank study had a low response rate (5·5%) and is characterised by a healthy volunteer effect, as is common in any volunteer-based cohort study. 47 Overall, the UK Biobank participants are healthier than the general population and, hence, this cohort might not be the best suitable cohort for estimation of generalised type 2 diabetes prevalence. The overall prevalence of type 2 diabetes in this cohort is lower than the national average but compares well with any other large UK-based cohorts. 6 Nonetheless, given the large sample size and population-level and geographical diversity, this low response rate and healthy volunteer effect does not imply loss of generalisability in the reported findings. 48,49 Given the rapid pace of urbanisation and globalisation and the associated changes in lifestyles and dietary preferences, the potential effect of access to ready-to-eat food environments that sell food for instant consumption on health requires special attention. Our study that assessed a very large, UK-wide cohort of substantial population-level and geographical diversity found that access to ready-to-eat food outlets was associated with higher odds of type 2 diabetes. The results have important public health implications and make the case for a shift from an exclusively corporate-driven economic model to a public health-driven health economic model of urban food access and consumption. This policy shift might require top-down interventions at a city scale, such as through formulating specific spatial policies to constrain access to unhealthy food environments that sell ready-to-eat food and to reduce their clustering around residential areas to potentially minimise unhealthy dietary consumption. Reducing the number of permits for outlets that sell calorie-dense food, as a policy, can further reduce the availability of unhealthy food. A specific policy suggested by our findings is to discourage the placement of outlier fast food outlets within residential areas via licensing or planning regulations. Fast food outlets tend to naturally cluster for economies of scale in attracting customers, especially customers who drive. However, there are still many independent outlets scattered through the UK's residential neighbourhoods. Confining outlets to regulated clusters is likely to reduce proximity-driven consumption. Confining outlets could also increase food quality through the effects of competition. There is an argument for specific nutritional standards and labelling for the food industry, not only for processed food items but also for ready-to-eat meals, fast food takeaways, and beverages to be consumed instantly and mechanisms to ensure compliance through regular auditing. Overall, national-level policies must encourage and incentivise the food industry to transform menus from unhealthy to healthy. By contrast, specific public health interventions at the primary care level could aim to disincentivise unhealthy access and unhealthy consumption in ready-to-eat food environments, especially among vulnerable individuals, including those who are obese and who have type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases. Additional long-term longitudinal studies are needed to effectively guide such interventions. Contributors CS, CW, and JG conceived and designed the study.

funding_text 1={This research was supported in part by a grant from The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NIH/NICHD R01HD061622), from the NICHD supported University of Colorado Population Center (R24 HD066613). This research uses data from Add Health, a program project directed by Kathleen Mullan Harris (PI) and designed by J. Richard Udry, Peter S. Bearman, and Kathleen Mullan Harris at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and funded by grant P01-HD031921 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, with cooperative funding from 23 other federal agencies and foundations. Information on how to obtain the Add Health data files is available on the Add Health website (http://www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth). This research uses Add Health GWAS data funded by Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Grants R01 HD073342 to Kathleen Mullan Harris (PI) and R01 HD060726 to Kathleen Mullan Harris, Jason D. Boardman, and Matthew B. McQueen (MPIs). This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource under Application Number 16651. NICHD supported Boardman’s training in this area through an early career development award (K01HD50336), and this project would not have possible without that support.

The UK Biobank is a nationwide, health-oriented, cohort study conducted across 22 dedicated assessment centers throughout the United Kingdom22 investigating the association of lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors with an array of health outcomes. Invitations to participate were mailed to approximately 9.2 million UK homes. These invitations recruited 502 664 participants, aged 37 to 73 years, who attended UK Biobank assessment centers in person. Written informed consent was obtained from participants at the assessment centers before they were led through an extensive assessment process including touchscreen questionnaires, in-person interviews, and physical health examinations. There was no financial compensation. Full details of the UK Biobank data collection procedures are available elsewhere.22 This study is covered under the generic ethical approval for the UK Biobank from the National Health Service Research Ethics Committee. The specific analysis presented in this study was separately approved by the UK Biobank research committee.},

funding_text 1={Data from the UK Biobank study were used for discovery of variants. Briefly, the UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort study of approximately a half-million adults (ages 40–69) living in the United Kingdom (UK), recruited from 22 centers across the UK [21]. All participants provided written informed consent. Ethical approval of the UK Biobank study was given by the North West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee, the National Information Governance Board for Health & Social Care, and the Community Health Index Advisory Group. We also used data from the ARIC study (n = 8,556), which is a prospective cohort study of over 15,000 adults aged 45–64 years that took place in four United States communities. The selection of this cohort for replication was based on (1) the quality of the PA phenotype which incorporates multiple questions assessing types, intensities, and frequency of PA (see below), (2) the focus on habitual, leisure-time PA, and (3) the relatively large sample size. In the absence of previous effect size estimates for genetic variants on PA, the sample size in ARIC, although comparatively much smaller than the UK Biobank, was deemed, on an a-priori basis, to serve as a suitable replication cohort. Details of the ARIC study can be found elsewhere [22]. All participants in ARIC provided written informed consent. Institutional review board approval was obtained by each participating field center . This study was approved by the University of Arizona Human Subjects Protection Program (Protocol number: 1300000659R001). To reduce the potential for confounding by population stratification, we included only individuals of white race/ ethnicity in both studies.},

Lower relative amplitude is a rhythmicity measure that represents smaller differences in activity profiles between daily rest and activity periods, and was associated with increased odds of lifetime major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Lower relative amplitude was also associated with greater odds of mood instability and self-reported feelings of loneliness, higher neuroticism scores, reduced self-rated happiness, lower health satisfaction, and slower reaction times. These associations were independent of various demographic, lifestyle, activity, and childhood trauma variables, and associations with all wellbeing, personality, and cognitive variables, apart from mood instability, remained after the exclusion of participants with a lifetime history of mood disorders. Findings that low relative amplitude is associated with increased odds of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder are consistent with suggestions that disruption of circadian rhythms is a core feature of mood disorders and with results from previous, smaller investigations showing lower relative amplitude in individuals with bipolar disorder. 3 Lower relative amplitude reflects reduced distinction, in terms of activity levels, between the active and rest periods of the day. This reduced distinction could be a result of reduced activity during waking periods, which is often seen in depressive episodes, increased activity during rest periods linked to sleep disturbances, which are common in mood disorders, or a combination of both. This flattening of the rest–activity cycle is thought to represent disrupted 24-h circadian rhythmicity and less entrainment to external zeitgebers (ie, a recurring external or environmental cue, such as natural light, which helps synchronise circadian rhythms). 19 Reduced relative amplitude has been reported in healthy individuals who score highly on mania scales and in healthy relatives of individuals with bipolar disorder. 20 We provide, to our knowledge, the first direct evidence of associations between objectively measured circadian disruption and neuroticism and mood instability, which have both been consistently linked to increased risk of mood disorders. The effect sizes for mood instability and neuroticism were small, so the clinical relevance of these associations is unclear. Furthermore, associations between relative amplitude and mood instability were attenuated after the exclusion of participants who met the criteria for mood disorder, suggesting that the association might have been partly driven by greater mood instability in participants with psychiatric conditions. However, the association of neuroticism with relative amplitude remained after the exclusion of participants with probable major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, consistent with suggestions that circadian disruption is associated with increased susceptibility to mood disorders. 20 Associations between low relative amplitude and reduced self-rated happiness, health satisfaction, and increased subjective loneliness indicate that circadian disruption is more generally associated with impaired subjective wellbeing, especially given that these associations persisted after the exclusion of participants reporting lifetime mood disorder. Deficits in memory, reaction times, and attention have been reported after sleep deprivation and in shift workers. 21,22 Our work extends previous findings by showing, within a large population-based cohort, that objectively measured circadian disruption is associated with slower reaction times independent of demographic, lifestyle, activity, BMI, and childhood trauma covariates. Reaction time shows consistent associations with higher general intelligence and white matter integrity and is often considered a general marker of neurocognitive functioning. 23,24 Our findings support the view that impairments to this functioning are associated with circadian disruption. Because of the cross-sectional nature of the data, the current findings cannot speak to the issue of causal associations between circadian disruption and poorer mental health and wellbeing outcomes. This limitation is compounded by the temporal separation between the recording of baseline demographic and lifestyle variables (2006–10), accelerometry data (2013–14), and the MHQ (2016–17), particularly because reaction time, neuroticism, and loneliness data were collected before the accelerometry data. Our goal was to look for evidence of cross-sectional associations rather than to infer causality. Future work following up on the participants with accelerometry data will be useful in elucidating the nature and direction of causality. As the UK Biobank cohort matures, future studies will be able to examine the extent to which low relative amplitude can predict new diagnoses of mood disorders (although this possibility might be limited by the age of the UK Biobank cohort) or new depressive or manic episodes in patients with existing mood disorder diagnoses. The collection of further accelerometry data in the same participants would allow examination of whether within-participant changes in relative amplitude can predict the onset of new episodes and whether stabilisation of objectively measured rhythmicity is associated with improved mental health and cognitive and wellbeing outcomes. Mendelian randomisation analysis using alleles associated with circadian disruption might be able to examine evidence for causal associations between circadian disruption and mental health and wellbeing outcomes. 25 Rest–activity rhythms differ between younger and older adults, so associations between circadian rhythmicity and mental health and wellbeing might differ in cohorts of participants who are younger than those in the UK Biobank. Given that the circadian system undergoes developmental changes during adolescence, 26 a common time for the onset of mood disorders, longitudinal study of rhythmicity in younger populations and comparison with findings from the UK Biobank might aid in the understanding of causal mechanisms. Overall, our findings suggest a reliable association between circadian disruption and both risk of mood disorders and worse subjective wellbeing outcomes. Our results also highlight the potential usefulness of accelerometry-derived relative amplitude as a marker of susceptibility to negative mental health and wellbeing outcomes. Relative amplitude is relatively cheaply and easily measured and might be useful for identifying people at greater risk of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, or subgroups of patients who might benefit from therapies aimed at improving circadian rhythmicity.

The resource for the GERA cohort was accessed via dbGap (accession number: phs000674.v2.p2) and was created by a RC2 Grand Opportunity grant that was awarded to the Kaiser Permanente Research Program on Genes, Environment, and Health (RPGEH) and the University of California, San Francisco Institute for Human Genetics (AG036607; Catherine Schaefer and Neil Risch principal investigators). The RC2 project enabled genome-wide SNP genotyping (GWAS) to be conducted on a cohort of over 100,000 adults who are members of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Plan, Northern California Region, and are participating in its RPGEH. The purpose of the RPGEH is to facilitate research on the genetic and environmental factors that affect health and disease by linking together clinical data from electronic health records, survey data on demographic and behavioral factors, and environmental data from various sources with genetic data derived from biospe-cimens collected from participants. This study has been conducted using the UK Biobank resource under Application Number 12514.

funding_text 1={We used a novel genetically stratified survival analysis to identify cases of type 1 diabetes in a cross-sectional population of 379 511 people in UK Biobank. Genetically defined type 1 diabetes represented 9·7% (1286 of 13 250) of all diabetes cases diagnosed in the first six decades of life, with 58% (749 cases, 74% of all cases of diabetes in this age range) of type 1 diabetes cases diagnosed when patients were aged 30 years or younger and 42% (537 cases, 4% of all cases) of cases diagnosed when individuals were aged 31–60 years. The phenotype of type 1 diabetes was similar for the group diagnosed when aged 31–60 years and the group diagnosed when aged 30 years or younger; individuals in both groups had a low BMI, rapidly progressed to insulin treatment, and were at increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis compared with participants with assumed type 2 diabetes. Our findings suggest that type 1 diabetes presents throughout the first six decades of life. Although type 1 diabetes is easy to identify and study in individuals aged 30 years or younger, identification of type 1 diabetes in individuals who present when older than 30 years is more challenging because of the much greater background incidence of type 2 diabetes in older populations. We have shown that genetic predisposition to type 1 diabetes, defined in children, predisposes to diabetes at all ages. Our subtraction method allowed a genetic definition of disease. Although monogenic disease is usually defined by its genetic aetiology, to our knowledge, this study is the first to use a subtraction method with genetic predisposition to define cases of a common complex polygenic disease. Numerous studies 2 have shown that type 1 diabetes can occur in individuals older than 30 years, but researchers have been unable to quantify to what degree it occurs. Approaches to this dilemma have broadly categorised type 1 diabetes either by clinical definitions, C-peptide negativity, or autoantibody positivity. In clinical practice, further investigations are rarely done and, when they are, interpretation is challenging because of the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the population older than 30 years. Clinical diagnosis is often based on poorly discriminatory clinical characteristics and, as a result, misdiagnosis is common. Among individuals diagnosed with diabetes when older than 35 years, 56% of those who commence insulin treatment immediately do not progress to absolute insulin deficiency, and 7% of those not initially treated with insulin do progress to absolute insulin deficiency. 4 The clinical characteristics resulting from a genetic definition of type 1 diabetes can be compared with the clinical characteristics of type 1 diabetes defined by the presence of islet autoantibodies. In children and young adults with diabetes, who are typically non-obese and rapidly insulin dependent, both genetically defined type 1 diabetes and islet-antibody-positive diabetes define almost all patients. We identified a similar phenotype when genetically defined type 1 diabetes was diagnosed in individuals aged 31–60 years: 89% of patients were treated with insulin within 1 year of diagnosis and about one in nine were admitted to hospital with documented diabetic ketoacidosis. By contrast, most patients with diabetes diagnosed in middle age who have islet antibodies do not usually proceed rapidly to insulin therapy. In latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA)—defined as patients diagnosed when aged 35–70 years who have antibodies to GAD and who are not initially treated with insulin—about 30–40% of patients are treated with insulin within the first 3 years after diagnosis, and the BMI, lipid profiles, and genetic susceptibility of these patients are intermediate between young-onset type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. 24 Rather than a single intermediate phenotype, a possible explanation is that patients who are antibody positive when the prevalence of type 1 diabetes is low represent a mixture of true positives (young-onset type 1 diabetes phenotype) and false positives (type 2 diabetes). The phenotypic heterogeneity seen in LADA, depending on the population studied and the titre and number of antibodies used, supports this concept. 24 Further research is needed to investigate genetically defined type 1 diabetes, autoantibodies, and C-peptide within a single cohort. Our genetically stratified survival analysis approach to identifying type 1 diabetes in a population has several advantages. First, the permanence of genetic risk from birth allows survival analysis to be done in a cross-sectional study. Second, the survival curve for type 2 diabetes in the low genetic risk score group allows use of a sensitive, but not specific, cutoff to identify almost all type 1 diabetes cases and then remove type 2 diabetes cases by subtraction. Third, a genetic definition of type 1 diabetes at a population level identifies cases without making assumptions about associated clinical features or requiring autoantibody measurement. This approach meant that we were able to assess clinical features in our study because they were not used to define type 1 diabetes. This strategy of using type 1 genetic susceptibility is independent of and complementary to methods based on clinical features, autoantibodies, or C-peptide measurement. Notably, this method could potentially be applied to other polygenic diseases with strong genetic susceptibility to provide an unbiased population assessment of their contribution to a common phenotype with multiple alternative causes. This study has clear clinical implications. Our findings alert clinicians that type 1 diabetes occurs often after age 30 years, but that it is difficult to detect because of the predominance of type 2 diabetes in older adults. A high index of suspicion for type 1 diabetes in later life is important because it has a rapidly progressive phenotype with a substantial risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes should be considered in any middle-aged patient with type 2 diabetes who does not show good glycaemic control on rapidly escalating therapy, especially if they are slim. At the individual level, a high type 1 diabetes genetic risk score (above the median of the population) cannot be used to diagnose type 1 diabetes in a patient with diabetes diagnosed in middle age because most (>90%) individuals with a high score will have type 2 diabetes. By contrast, a low genetic risk score (below the median of the population) can be used to say that a patient is unlikely to have type 1 diabetes. This genetic exclusion method is also used in existing clinical guidelines for diagnosis of coeliac disease 11,12 and ankylosing spondylitis. 13 Calculating the probability of a type 1 diabetes diagnosis for an individual will be helped in the future by development of statistical models that incorporate quantitative clinical features, such as age of diagnosis and BMI, with the type 1 diabetes genetic risk score. This study has several limitations. UK Biobank is a voluntary study recruiting from 22 sites across the UK; these volunteers are typically healthier and of higher socioeconomic status than the general UK population. 25 All participants have reached the age of 37 years, introducing a selection bias against people who are unhealthy or have not survived to this age. This selection bias might lead to an underestimate of type 1 diabetes at all ages and particularly in those diagnosed as children because they would be more likely to have serious morbidity or mortality from complications that could reduce likelihood of entry into the study. In our study, the prevalence of diabetes diagnosed in children younger than 10 years was 35 cases per 100 000 population, which is lower than expected from previous studies (around 100 cases per 100 000 population). 3,26 A further contributing factor is that UK Biobank participants were born between 1934 and 1971, and type 1 diabetes has been presenting at younger ages over time. 27 Underestimation of type 1 diabetes diagnosed in the youngest decade would have reduced the proportion of cases diagnosed when aged 30 years or younger in our study. However, this underestimation will not alter the phenotypic similarity in the clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed in the two age groups or the finding that presentation after age 30 years is common. The age distribution of people in UK Biobank meant that we only had power to assess diabetes in individuals aged 60 years or younger. Therefore, we cannot predict whether the frequency of type 1 diabetes diminishes after age 60 years. We limited the study to individuals of white European descent because the type 1 diabetes genetic risk score has only been validated in white people. This approach means the results are specific to this ethnic group, and other studies are needed to validate the type 1 diabetes genetic risk score in other ethnic groups and to investigate older-onset type 1 diabetes in these populations. We used a type 1 diabetes genetic risk score developed in a reference population who were all diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when younger than 17 years. 16,23 Although the type 1 diabetes genetic risk score has not been tested in an adult-onset type 1 diabetes population, genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes in later life almost completely overlaps with that of childhood diabetes. 28 Large studies 16,18 of well defined type 1 and type 2 diabetes populations have shown that almost no overlap exists between risk of type 1 diabetes and risk of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium cohort, type 2 diabetes had an identical distribution of type 1 diabetes genetic risk scores to a control population without diabetes and a population with monogenic diabetes. These data support our assumption that the excess of cases in the high genetic risk score group are type 1 diabetes. In conclusion, use of a novel genetic approach to define type 1 diabetes has shown that it presents across the first six decades of life and should not be considered a disease of children and young adults. Whatever age it presents, type 1 diabetes is associated with rapid requirement for insulin and risk of ketoacidosis, suggesting that it is not a milder phenotype if diagnosed later in life. A key area for both clinical practice and research in the future is to improve recognition of late-onset type 1 diabetes. Contributors RAO, ATH, NJT, and MNW designed the study.

funding_text 1={Genotype data were available for all ALSPAC individuals enrolled in the ARIES project, which had previously undergone QC, cleaning and imputation at the cohort level. ALSPAC offspring selected for this project had previously been genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad genome-wide SNP genotyping platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI, Cambridge, UK) and the Laboratory Corporation of America (LCA, Burlington, NC, USA). Samples were excluded based on incorrect sex assignment; abnormal heterozygosity (<0.320 or >0.345 for WTSI data; <0.310 or >0.330 for LCA data); high missingness (>3%); cryptic relatedness (>10% identity by descent) and non-European ancestry (detected by multidimensional scaling analysis). After QC, 500 527 SNP loci were available for the directly genotyped dataset. Following QC the final directly geno-typed dataset contained 526 688 SNP loci.},
