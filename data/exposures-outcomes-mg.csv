Kyle2017bank.001,Sleep and cognitive performance: cross-sectional associations in the UK Biobank,No,,Yes,"""The five tasks involved the following instructions:
 Reasoning: This task assessed the ability to solve 13 verbal and
numeric reasoning problems. Each problem had five possible
response options. The dependent variable was the total number
of correct answers given (range 0e13) within a 2-min period,
with higher scores indicating better performance.
 Basic reaction time: This task was delivered in the style of the
card game, ‘snap’, and requested participants to respond with a
button press when they detected the appearance of a matching
pair of symbols. The dependent variable was the mean response
time in milliseconds across 12 matching-pair trials. RT values
were log-transformed because of skewed distribution (ln x).
 Numeric short-term memory: In this task, a string of numbers
was presented on the screen, which subsequently disappeared.
Participants were then asked to enter the number string from
memory, in the reverse order, through a keypad. The dependent
variable was the maximum string length recalled correctly
(range: 0e12), with higher scores indicating better performance.
The test was discontinued after five successive incorrect
responses at string length ¼ 2.
 Visual memory: In this task, six card pairs of symbols were presented
on-screen in a random pattern. Cards were then turned
face down on the screen, and participantswere asked to locate as
many symbol pairs as possible in as fewattempts as possible. The
dependent variable was the number of errors made during pairs
matching (range 0e146), which was log-transformed because of
skewed distribution and zero inflation (ln (x þ 1)).
 Prospective memory: In this task, participants were asked to
remember to perform a pre-planned instruction. Specifically, at
the beginning of the test battery, they were presented with the
following instruction: ‘At the end of the games we will show you
four coloured symbols and ask you to touch the blue square.
However, to test your memory,wewant you to actually touch the
orange circle instead’. If participants remembered to touch the
orange circle on first attempt, they were coded as ‘correct’ (1),
while those failing to do so were set to 0."""
