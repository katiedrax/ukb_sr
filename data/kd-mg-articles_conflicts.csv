Extra-articular manifestations might be associated as well, such as iritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and genitourinary tract inflammation. 1  Recent studies investigated the link between AS and oral diseases, particularly periodontitis. 2–4 Generally, oral diseases are prevalent chronic diseases worldwide; especially periodontal disease and dental caries. Their impact on general health raises their importance. 5  Periodontal disease is a group of diseases which affect the tissue surrounding the teeth. It might lead to the destruction of the alveolar bone and loss of tooth support. These diseases are characterised by periodontal tissue inflammation, gingival bleeding, pocket formation, and/or tooth mobility. 6 Its prevalence and severity increase with age. 7 Periodontal diseases are initiated by periodontal pathogens. However, host response in conjunction with several risk factors, such as cigarette smoking and emotional stress, play an important role in the initiation and progression of periodontal destruction. 7  There is growing evidence that periodontitis is linked and might initiate other systemic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. 8 Others hypothesised that periodontal pathogens, especially Porphyromonas gingivalis, could be the triggering factor for the autoimmunity against citrullinating proteins in the joints, which might initiate rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 9 Evidence of similarity in the immune-pathologic condition between AS and periodontitis is present. Significant elevations in the levels of interleukin 6 and tumour necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-a) are present in both AS and periodontitis patients. 10,11  Due to the difficulties in conducting population- based studies using clinical diagnosis, self-reported disease is an alternative way of diagnosis. Selfreported AS was shown to be agreeable with the clinical records 12 , whereas self-reported periodontal disease was shown to be agreeable with the clinical diagnosis of periodontitis. 13 It was also shown that the reporting of the number of natural teeth, presence or absence of prosthetic appliance, and root canal filling by the patients was agreeable with the clinical findings for these patients. 14""","""Recent studies investigated the link between AS and oral diseases, particularly periodontitis. 2 – 4 Generally, oral diseases are prevalent chronic diseases worldwide; especially periodontal disease and dental caries.

Similarly, gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy, but the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide (951 000 new cases and 723 000 deaths) 1. Two main histological subtypes of esophageal cancers are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Notably, the two subtypes differ in terms of their risk factors and incidence patterns 2-4. The majority of adenocarcinoma cases develop from Barrett's mucosa in the lower third of the esophagus, while SCC typically occurs in the upper two-thirds of the esophagus 3.  Synthesis of vitamin D in the skin following exposure to UVB from sunlight is the main source of vitamin D for humans, particularly among those who do not take vitamin D supplements 5. Vitamin D has been associated with reduced risk of multiple internal cancers 6-8. For esophageal and gastric cancer, the evidence is sparse and vastly mixed: a recent systematic review 9 found an increased risk of esophageal cancer overall with higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration; a nonsignificantly increased risk of adenocarcinoma with higher dietary vitamin D intake, but a nonsignificantly decreased risk of SCC 10-12. Finally, a single study reported a significantly decreased risk of adenocarcinoma with higher lifetime UVB exposure 13. In a similar study, a nonsignificantly decreased risk of gastric cancer was observed with higher 25(OH)D, but a nonsignificantly increased risk with higher vitamin D intake 14. Therefore, mixed evidence from a limited number of mostly small studies prevents any conclusions from being drawn and highlights the need for more research 14, 15. Additionally, dietary sources of vitamin D from food have been shown to be poor determinants of vitamin D in some studies 8, 16, and therefore, the results from studies measuring only dietary sources from foods should be interpreted with caution. 25(OH)D is known as the best measure of vitamin D status at a given point in time; however, it is strongly affected by the season of blood draw and other, sometimes particular circumstances (e.g. return from sun holiday); moreover, it does not capture exposure over a prolonged time period. This may be important when examining the relationship between 25(OH)D and conditions which take time to develop. Furthermore, 25(OH)D concentration at the time of blood draw may be of limited relevance: For example, vitamin D status at cancer diagnosis is of limited value when assessing the role in cancer occurrence. Therefore, using UVB instead of 25(OH)D offers some important advantages for epidemiological studies, provided it can be captured accurately—but this has largely not been the case to date, as most studies use total UV dose, ignore important factors such as cloud cover and ozone or assume equal exposure for the large geographical region; in addition, majority of published studies that used UV are ecological in design.""","""An estimated 456 000 new cases and 400 000 deaths in 2012 make esophageal cancer the eighth most common cancer worldwide, but the sixth most common cause of cancer death due to a very poor survival 1. Similarly, gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy, but the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide (951 000 new cases and 723 000 deaths) 1. Two main histological subtypes of esophageal cancers are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Notably, the two subtypes differ in terms of their risk factors and incidence patterns 2-4. The majority of adenocarcinoma cases develop from Barrett's mucosa in the lower third of the esophagus, while SCC typically occurs in the upper two-thirds of the esophagus 3.""",Yes,Yes,,""" Therefore, using UVB instead of 25(OH)D offers some important advantages for epidemiological studies, provided it can be captured accurately—but this has largely not been the case to date, as most studies use total UV dose, ignore important factors such as cloud cover and ozone or assume equal exposure for the large geographical region; in addition, majority of published studies that used UV are ecological in design.

This provided detailed information on cancer characteristics including tumor histological information (esophageal SCC or adenocarcinoma) and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes—these were used to identify esophageal and gastric cancer cases and obtain exact location of esophageal cancer: C15.3/15.4 denoted upper and middle thirds of the esophagus (typical location for SCC) and C15.5 denoted lower third (typical location for adenocarcinoma) 21.  Flowchart of participant selection is outlined in Fig. 1. In total, there were 416 936 participants with no cancer diagnosis at the time of recruitment. There were 622 incident esophageal and gastric cancer cases diagnosed after recruitment, and these were kept in our study. Eligible controls were selected from the pool of individuals (n = 396 306) who had never had a diagnosis of cancer (including skin cancer), either self-reported (N = 7213) and not on the national registry or registered in the national cancer registry (N = 42 057). All individuals in the cohort who matched in gender and ±one year of age for a given case were identified, and five were randomly chosen from that set for a given case, as age- and gender-matched controls. Controls could not be matched to cases based on their recruitment date as recruitment was linked to location; as a consequence, unwanted matching by UVB would occur....UVB data source and annual ambient D-UVB UV dose data from the Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Internet Service (TEMIS) database (www.temis.nl/uvradiation/UVdose.html; version 2.0) were used 22. This service, provided by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in conjunction with the European Space Agency, determines the amount of UV radiation incident at the surface of earth in Wm-2, as a function of the total ozone column (derived from satellite observations) and the solar zenith angle at a given local solar time 22. As the potential to induce vitamin D synthesis varies dramatically with wavelength, only UVB radiation restricted specifically to wavelengths which can induce cutaneous vitamin D production was considered (290–315 nm) and a weighting function was applied (peak synthesis occurs at 295–298 nm) 23. Moreover, a correction for cloud cover, surface elevation and surface UV reflectivity (UV albedo) is applied to the estimate. We denote this as D-UVB (further detail can be found elsewhere 15, 22). The data are provided on a 0.25°×0.25° (longitude × latitude) grid with each grid cell covering an area of approximately 28 km (north–south) × 17 km (east–west); 782 such grid cells cover Scotland, England and Wales.  Each participant was assigned a TEMIS grid cell based on their residential location. We calculated the annual ambient D-UVB dose for each participant by summing up daily doses, for the year (365 days) preceding the date of recruitment to UK Biobank. Median and interquartile range (IQR) were reported. The annual ambient D-UVB at a given location does not change dramatically from year to year; hence, the annual D-UVB dose in a 1-year period is predictive of the annual D-UVB dose for another 1-year period (Figure S1). As D-UVB is seasonal, it is important to include D-UVB doses for an entire year to prevent seasonal bias in the estimate leading to misclassification of D-UVB dose received by individuals. An example of D-UVB dose's over one location (London) is shown in Figure S1""",methods section,Partially,Yes,,"Missing assessment methods and details of handling for skin color, smoking, alcohol and ease of tanning so unsure how categorised ""time spent outdoors (average number of hours/day in summer and winter; the average of these was calculated and categorized: 0–2 h day-1 represented “low” category, 2–5 h day-1 represented “intermediate,” and >5 h day-1 represented “high” level of time spent outdoors)"" D-UVB tertiles explained in Table 1",methods section,No,No,,,,Partially,Yes,Becky it,"Unclear whether covariates not included in final model were used in backward stepwise regression ""Statistical analysis Conditional logistic regression was used for primary analysis of an association between annual D-UVB dose and odds of developing esophageal or gastric cancer. Each case was assigned a specific five controls for this, so when stratified by cancer type/cancer location, the controls were stratified according to their specific case's cancer diagnosis. Odds ratios and confidence intervals were calculated based on annual D-UVB tertiles (lowest as reference). P for trend was also determined using annual D-UVB as a continuous variable. Covariates used in the final model were smoking status, alcohol intake, BMI, qualifications, gastro-esophageal reflux and gastric ulcers. Backward stepwise regression was used to determine the final model, and model was selected by balancing the lower numbers of AIC/BIC scores, along with a high r2 number and a low number of missing samples. Other covariates were also considered, but excluded in final model (ease of tanning, use of sun protection, average sun exposure, skin color, oily fish consumption, average time spent outdoors, egg consumption, vitamin D supplementation, osteoporosis, cardiovascular condition and diabetes). The 10% rule was also used to determine confounders; however, there was little difference observed between the two methods and the final method chosen was backward stepwise regression. Conditional logistic regression based on quintiles of annual D-UVB and unconditional logistic regression using tertiles of annual D-UVB were also carried out and are shown in Tables S1 and S2.

Economic implications of sleep disturbance cannot be overlooked and include increased absenteeism and lost productivity,13 more accidents14 and increased healthcare utilisation and costs.13 In the USA, the annual economic burden of sleep disturbance has been estimated at $100 billion,13 and the National Health Service (NHS) in England spends around £50 million on sleep medication each year.15  It is evident that nicotine can stimulate the release of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine16 which, in turn, may inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and sleep-promoting neurons located in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), causing excessive arousal of the body.17 Electroencephalography (EEG) reports have also revealed marked differences in sleep waves between smokers and non-smokers, with smokers having frequent arousals.18 There is strong evidence that smoking cessation is associated with poor sleep;19 however, previous studies on active smoking and sleep characteristics have produced conflicting results.

Those who had previously smoked were grouped as ‘former smokers’, and those who were neither current smokers nor had previously smoked were grouped as ‘never smokers.’ In addition, data on daily number of cigarettes consumed by current and former smokers, and whether never smokers lived with one or more current smoker were obtained from the participants.37  Sleep duration was defined as the total number of hours a respondent reported to be sleeping in a day. The participants were asked: ‘About how many hours of sleep do you get in every 24 h?’ We categorised the numerical responses into short-sleep duration (<6 h per day), normal (6–9 h per day) and long-sleep duration (>9 h per day) using the National Sleep Foundation definition of short-, long- and normal-sleep duration.38 The questions: ‘Do you have trouble falling asleep at night or do you wake up in the middle of the night?’ and ‘How likely are you to doze off or fall asleep during the daytime when you don’t mean to?’ were used to evaluate sleeplessness and DD, respectively.37  The participants’ health state was evaluated with a question that asked the participants to rate their health on a scale of 1–4: ‘1’ equated to ‘excellent health’ and ‘4’ equated to ‘poor health.’ They were also asked whether they felt ‘stressed’ or ‘depressed’ and their responses were used to ascertain stress and depression separately.37 Shift work was evaluated with a question that asked the participants to describe their current shift pattern, whether it involved a shift schedule. The responses were: ‘Not’, ‘Sometimes’, ‘Usually’ and ‘Always’ in shift work. Participants were further asked whether they considered themselves to be ‘Definitely a morning person’, ‘More of a morning person’, ‘More of an evening person’ and ‘Definitely an evening person’ based on the time they were most active.

The inter-relationship between metabolic and cardiovascular disease is termed cardio-metabolic (CM) health. Those with both CVD and type 2 diabetes have a particularly poor prognosis and require aggressive risk factor intervention [3]. Obesity now affects 34.9% of all US adults and 26% of UK adults with a greater than doubling of the prevalence over the last 30 years [4].  There is increasing recognition of the metabolic impact of many prescribed analgesic medications used for relief of chronic pain. Certain medications have been used far more widely in recent years, in particular those for chronic non cancer pain. This includes opioids, the alpha2delta ligands pregabilin and gabapentin and certain antidepressants shown to decrease neuropathic pain, in particular amitriptyline and more recently duloxetine which is specifically licensed for diabetic neuropathic pain. Many of these medications have been labelled as dependence-forming medications (DFM) whereby patients require continual use to maintain a state of normality and avoid symptoms of withdrawal [5]. Prescribing data shows a substantial rise in these prescriptions over the last ten years in the UK and the US. An estimated 3–4% of US adults are prescribed opioids [6]. The use of strong opioids has increased alongside gabapentin and pregabilin [7].  The increased use of opioid medication has led to increasing recognition of their side effects when used chronically and the use of long term opioid medication has become increasingly controversial with recent, far reaching changes to reduce prescribing in the US [8]. The dangers of addiction, sleep disordered breathing, daytime sedation and accidental overdose are well known and researched [9]. The impact of opioids upon appetite, metabolism and the insulin axis is less well studied [10]. More recently cohort studies have suggested that those using chronic opiate prescriptions in particular have an increased mortality rate from all causes but there may be many confounding factors when studying those with chronic pain and the reasons for this association remain debated [11].  Weight gain with neuropathic pain meds is described but often in small studies looking at the impact upon the first 6–12 weeks of prescription [12,13]. There have been few large studies addressing the potential association between commonly prescribed analgesic drugs and CM health. However, smaller studies following patients prescribed gabapentin, pregabilin, amitriptyline have shown increased BMI in those followed up between periods of 3–6 months. Weight gain is cited as one of the commonest reasons for discontinuing these medications [14]. Opiates have been shown to cause insulin resistance but whether they clearly cause weight gain over time remains debated [10]. Many of the analgesic drugs cause sedation and increase the risk of sleep disordered breathing. Sleep disturbance in itself causes insulin resistance with increasing recognition of the association between sleep and circadian rhythm disturbance, worse CM health and increased obesity [15].""","""Obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes represent significant personal, societal and economic burden [1,2].

Smoking and alcohol status were obtained by asking participants to respond to ‘Prefer not to answer’, ‘Never’, ‘Previous’ and ‘Current’. Physical activity was assessed using adapted questions from the validated short International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)[17] which collects information on the frequency and duration of time spent in walking, moderate and vigorous activity in the previous 7 days. Data processing rules for IPAQ were followed [18]. According to the current UK physical activity guidelines [19] we identified those who reached 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week, or a combination of both. Walking was considered as moderate activity. Participants reported how long they spent watching television (TV) on a typical day. This was asked twice to those who responded >8 hours, therefore high values were deemed robust. Those who reported more than 3 hours/day were identified based upon previous literature [20]. Diet was reported using the Food Frequency Questionnaire [21] and healthy eating was assessed using the UK’s fruit and vegetable guidelines of 5 portions per day [21]. The townsend deprivation index combines information on housing, employment, car availability and social class, with higher values representing lower socioeconomic status. This was calculated before participants joined the UK Biobank and was based on the preceding national census data, with each participant assigned a score corresponding to the home postcode [16].  To measure sleep duration, participants were asked ‘About how many hours sleep do you get in every 24 hours?’ (please include naps). This was asked twice to those who responded >12 hours. As sleep shows a ‘U’ shaped relationship with CM risk [22], we created 3 sleep duration groups of <6 (poor sleep), 6–9 (good sleep), and >9 hours (poor sleep) per night.  Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from: weight (kg)/height(m)2. Weight was measured using the Tanita BC-418MA body composition analyser, to the nearest 0.1 kg and height was measured using a Seca 202 height measure. Waist circumference (cm) was measured at the level of the umbilicus using a Wessex non-stretchable sprung tape measure, which has previously been adopted in large health studies [23]. Participants were asked to adjust clothing for accuracy, and all staff were trained in taking these measures. Self-report disease status (including Sleep Apnoea and hypertension) and medication use was obtained from participants during the touchscreen questionnaire, which was then entered and verified by a UK Biobank nurse after further questioning during the verbal interview. The interview provided extra information such as time of diagnosis, and if the trained nurse decides that the illness or medication had been incorrectly selected, they could remove the selection.""",No,No,,,,Yes,Yes,,S3 Table,Sup 3,NA,Yes,"Rule = ""NA"" if no interaction term used",,Sup 3,NA,NA,,,,non,NA,Yes,kd to check,,Sup 3,"""This cross-sectional analysis of the UK Biobank cohort has shown that those using sedative analgesic drugs, and in particular opiates, were far more likely to have poor CM health and increased obesity compared to those on CM drugs only.

Even during healthy aging, muscle function and mass decrease from ~40–45 years of age, with the mechanisms underlying this observation currently unknown (2). This loss of muscle mass and function appears to be accelerated in people with type 2 diabetes. A cross-sectional analysis of data from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (485 adults 70–79 years of age with type 2 diabetes and 2,133 without) showed that people with type 2 diabetes have lower leg (men only) and grip strength (3) and that after 6 years’ follow-up, they lose leg but not grip strength at a greater rate than healthy counterparts of comparable age (4,5).  Because skeletal muscle function is associated with health outcomes, this lower muscle function could contribute to the greater risk of developing comorbidities and mortality in people with type 2 diabetes. Thus, in addition to the accelerated loss of muscle mass/function, people with type 2 diabetes have been shown to be at a greater risk of all-cause and CVD mortality (6,7), with this risk higher again the longer a person has type 2 diabetes (8,9). Prior research reported that within a group of people (mean age 63.6 years) with impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes (n = 12,516), a higher grip strength is associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (10), reflecting the findings observed in general population studies.

Isometric grip force was assessed from a single 3-s maximal grip effort of the right- and left-side arms with participants seated upright with their elbow by their side and flexed at 90° so that their forearm was facing forward and resting on an armrest. The mean of the right- and left-side values, expressed in absolute units (kilograms), as reported elsewhere was used in the current study (14). For the purpose of this study and to take into account biological differences in grip strength within sex and age-groups, we derived age- and sex-specific categories of grip strength (Supplementary Table 1).  Physical activity was based on self-report by using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form (15), and total physical activity was calculated as the sum of walking, moderate, and vigorous activity measured as metabolic equivalents (MET-h/week). Participants were excluded from the analyses if they recorded implausible values defined as the sum of their total physical activity, sleeping time, and total screen time >24 h (which excluded 705 participants). Discretionary time spent on TV viewing and PC screen time were collected by using self-reported questionnaires. Subjective sleep duration was obtained by asking the following: About how many hours of sleep do you get in every 24 h? On the basis of this question, we derived a categorical sleep duration variable (short sleeper <7 h/day, normal sleeper 7–9 h/day, long sleepers >9 h/day).  Dietary information was collected in a subset of participants (n = 157,223 with dietary and diabetes data available) through the Oxford WebQ, a Web-based 24-h recall questionnaire developed specifically as a low-cost instrument for assessing diet in large-scale prospective studies. Compared with 24-h dietary recall, the mean Spearman correlation of the 21 nutrients obtained from the WebQ was 0.6, with the majority between 0.5 and 0.9 (16). The Oxford WebQ derives energy intake (total and from specific macronutrients) from the information recorded in McCance and Widdowson’s The Composition of Food (17). For participants who completed more than one online dietary questionnaire, mean values were calculated from all the information provided, with variation between repeated measurements ranging from 26 to 34% as described elsewhere (16). The intake of other food items, such as red meat, processed meat, oily fish, and fruits and vegetables, were collected by using a touch screen questionnaire on the reported frequency of consumption. These data were available for all participants.  Area-based socioeconomic status was derived from postal code of residence by using the Townsend deprivation score (18). Other sociodemographic information, such as employment (paid employment, retired, unable to work, unemployed, student, and other), professional qualifications (college or university, A [advanced] or O [ordinary] levels, General Certificate of Secondary Education, Certificate of Secondary Education, or equivalent levels), and income (<£18,000, £18,000–29,999, £30,000–51,999, £52,000–100,000, and >£100,000), was self-reported at baseline. Age was calculated from dates of birth and baseline assessment. Smoking status was categorized into never, former, and current. Medical history (physician diagnosis of depression, COPD, chronic asthma, chronic liver disease, alcohol problems, substance abuse, eating disorders, schizophrenia, cognitive impairment, Parkinson disease, dementia, chronic pain syndrome, heart disease, inflammatory disease, arthrosis, arthritis, and cancer) was collected from the self-completed baseline assessment questionnaire. Number of years with diabetes was derived from self-reported age at the assessment visit and age when diabetes was diagnosed. History of recent medication for diabetes (insulin), cholesterol, and hypertension at baseline was collected by self-reported touch screen questionnaire. Height and body weight were measured by trained nurses during the initial assessment visit. BMI was calculated as weight divided by height squared, and the World Health Organization criteria were used to classify BMI as underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m2), and obese (=30.0 kg/m2). Waist circumference was measured with a standardized protocol by trained nurses, and central obesity was derived by using 88 cm and 102 cm as cutoff points for women and men, respectively. Body composition (body fat as percentage and fat free mass in kilograms) was measured by trained nurses who used bioimpedance (range 1–75% in 0.1% increments on a Tanita BC-418MA body composition analyzer).

In women and men, respectively, hazard ratios per 5 kg lower grip strength were higher (all at P<0.05) for all cause mortality (1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.23, and 1.16, 1.15 to 1.17) and cause specific mortality from cardiovascular disease (1.19, 1.13 to 1.25, and 1.22, 1.18 to 1.26), all respiratory disease (1.31, 1.22 to 1.40, and 1.24, 1.20 to 1.28), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.24, 1.05 to 1.47, and 1.19, 1.09 to 1.30), all cancer (1.17, 1.13 to 1.21, 1.10, 1.07 to 1.13), colorectal cancer (1.17, 1.04 to 1.32, and 1.18, 1.09 to 1.27), lung cancer (1.17, 1.07 to 1.27, and 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), and breast cancer (1.24, 1.10 to 1.39) but not prostate cancer (1.05, 0.96 to 1.15). Several of these relations had higher hazard ratios in the younger age group. Muscle weakness (defined as grip strength <26 kg for men and <16 kg for women) was associated with a higher hazard for all health outcomes, except colon cancer in women and prostate cancer and lung cancer in both men and women. The addition of handgrip strength improved the prediction ability, based on C index change, of an office based risk score (age, sex, diabetes diagnosed, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and smoking) for all cause (0.013) and cardiovascular mortality (0.012) and incidence of cardiovascular disease (0.009).""",Yes,Yes,,""" Introduction The main role of skeletal muscle is to control body movements through the generation of force. Skeletal muscle is also the primary protein store within the body and in chronic conditions, such as cancer, and it can provide gluconeogenic precursors that are crucial for survival as such conditions progress.1 In addition to this, skeletal muscle is the primary outlet for glucose disposal in the body and is therefore important in metabolic conditions such as diabetes.2 Muscle mass is also decreased (cachexia) in many conditions, such as cancer, respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, and chronic infection and sepsis.3 With these broad physiological and functional roles, skeletal muscle has a critical, but often underrated, role in health.4  Many studies have shown that lower muscle function is associated with greater mortality and morbidity.567891011121314 For example, in 1 142 599 male adolescents (age 16-19 years) followed up over 24 years, low muscle strength was associated with higher all cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease but not from cancer.8 Recent data from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study (n=139 691 adults aged 35-70 years followed up for four years) showed that grip strength was inversely associated with all cause mortality and with non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular mortality, but no significant association was found with respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.7 Moreover, lower grip strength was found to be positively associated with incident cancer in high income countries but not in middle or lower income countries. The authors of this study concluded that, although some data support an association between grip strength and mortality, further research is needed to confirm this association with other health outcomes.7  Therefore, clear evidence shows that low grip strength is associated with a range of poorer health outcomes.567891011121314 Furthermore, grip strength enhances prediction of mortality based on age (C index increase from 0.65 for age to 0.69 for age+grip strength) and sex (C index increase from 0.54 for sex to 0.63 for sex+grip).14 However, whether the addition of handgrip strength to a traditional office based risk score (including age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, presence of diabetes, and body mass index15) improves risk prediction is unclear. Such analysis will allow us to determine whether measurement of grip strength has clinical utility for risk prediction in settings where blood based measures are not readily available (for example, community/rural settings or low/middle income countries).  A meta-analysis (53 476 participants) published in 2010 showed that grip strength was associated with lower all cause mortality; the association seemed to be weaker in studies in which participants had an average age of 60 years or less, relative to those with a higher average age at baseline.6 The relatively small sample size in this analysis limited the ability to fully explore how associations vary with age. The Tromso study (6850 participants, age 50-80 years) found associations between low grip strength and mortality,5 but no interaction with age was observed; again, power was limited by low participant numbers in this study""","""Many studies have shown that lower muscle function is associated with greater mortality and morbidity.567891011121314 For example, in 1 142 599 male adolescents (age 16-19 years) followed up over 24 years, low muscle strength was associated with higher all cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease but not from cancer.8 Recent data from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study (n=139 691 adults aged 35-70 years followed up for four years) showed that grip strength was inversely associated with all cause mortality and with non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular mortality, but no significant association was found with respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.7 Moreover, lower grip strength was found to be positively associated with incident cancer in high income countries but not in middle or lower income countries.

In women and men, respectively, hazard ratios per 5 kg lower grip strength were higher (all at P<0.05) for all cause mortality (1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.23, and 1.16, 1.15 to 1.17) and cause specific mortality from cardiovascular disease (1.19, 1.13 to 1.25, and 1.22, 1.18 to 1.26), all respiratory disease (1.31, 1.22 to 1.40, and 1.24, 1.20 to 1.28), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.24, 1.05 to 1.47, and 1.19, 1.09 to 1.30), all cancer (1.17, 1.13 to 1.21, 1.10, 1.07 to 1.13), colorectal cancer (1.17, 1.04 to 1.32, and 1.18, 1.09 to 1.27), lung cancer (1.17, 1.07 to 1.27, and 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), and breast cancer (1.24, 1.10 to 1.39) but not prostate cancer (1.05, 0.96 to 1.15). Several of these relations had higher hazard ratios in the younger age group. Muscle weakness (defined as grip strength <26 kg for men and <16 kg for women) was associated with a higher hazard for all health outcomes, except colon cancer in women and prostate cancer and lung cancer in both men and women. The addition of handgrip strength improved the prediction ability, based on C index change, of an office based risk score (age, sex, diabetes diagnosed, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and smoking) for all cause (0.013) and cardiovascular mortality (0.012) and incidence of cardiovascular disease (0.009).  Conclusion Higher grip strength was associated with a range of health outcomes and improved prediction of an office based risk score. Further work on the use of grip strength in risk scores or risk screening is needed to establish its potential clinical utility.  Introduction The main role of skeletal muscle is to control body movements through the generation of force. Skeletal muscle is also the primary protein store within the body and in chronic conditions, such as cancer, and it can provide gluconeogenic precursors that are crucial for survival as such conditions progress.1 In addition to this, skeletal muscle is the primary outlet for glucose disposal in the body and is therefore important in metabolic conditions such as diabetes.2 Muscle mass is also decreased (cachexia) in many conditions, such as cancer, respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, and chronic infection and sepsis.3 With these broad physiological and functional roles, skeletal muscle has a critical, but often underrated, role in health.4  Many studies have shown that lower muscle function is associated with greater mortality and morbidity.567891011121314 For example, in 1 142 599 male adolescents (age 16-19 years) followed up over 24 years, low muscle strength was associated with higher all cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease but not from cancer.8 Recent data from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study (n=139 691 adults aged 35-70 years followed up for four years) showed that grip strength was inversely associated with all cause mortality and with non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular mortality, but no significant association was found with respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.7 Moreover, lower grip strength was found to be positively associated with incident cancer in high income countries but not in middle or lower income countries. The authors of this study concluded that, although some data support an association between grip strength and mortality, further research is needed to confirm this association with other health outcomes.7  Therefore, clear evidence shows that low grip strength is associated with a range of poorer health outcomes.567891011121314 Furthermore, grip strength enhances prediction of mortality based on age (C index increase from 0.65 for age to 0.69 for age+grip strength) and sex (C index increase from 0.54 for sex to 0.63 for sex+grip).14 However, whether the addition of handgrip strength to a traditional office based risk score (including age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, presence of diabetes, and body mass index15) improves risk prediction is unclear. Such analysis will allow us to determine whether measurement of grip strength has clinical utility for risk prediction in settings where blood based measures are not readily available (for example, community/rural settings or low/middle income countries).  A meta-analysis (53 476 participants) published in 2010 showed that grip strength was associated with lower all cause mortality; the association seemed to be weaker in studies in which participants had an average age of 60 years or less, relative to those with a higher average age at baseline.6 The relatively small sample size in this analysis limited the ability to fully explore how associations vary with age. The Tromso study (6850 participants, age 50-80 years) found associations between low grip strength and mortality,5 but no interaction with age was observed; again, power was limited by low participant numbers in this study. The large size of the UK Biobank cohort provides the opportunity to robustly determine whether the association between grip strength and health outcomes differs by age.  The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the associations of grip strength with all cause mortality and disease specific incidence and mortality, how these associations vary with age, and whether the addition of grip strength improves the prediction ability of established office based risk scores, in the UK Biobank, a very large, general population cohort.  Methods Between April 2007 and December 2010, UK Biobank recruited 502 628 participants (5.5% response rate after invitation letters sent to around 9 million people), aged 40-69 years, from the general population.16 Participants attended one of 22 assessment centres across England, Wales, and Scotland,1718 where they completed a touch screen questionnaire, had physical measurements taken, and provided biological samples, as described in detail elsewhere.1718 The outcomes in the study reported here were incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease, all respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, all cancers, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer, as well as all cause mortality, with the exposure variable being grip strength (age and sex specific quarters and 5 kg increase in grip strength). We treated sociodemographic factors (age, sex, ethnicity, and area based socioeconomic status), month of recruitment, smoking status, height, body mass index, and self reported physical activity, sedentary time, and dietary intake as potential confounders, as well as prevalent diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, cancer, and longstanding illness at baseline (where participants with these conditions were not excluded from the analyses).  Procedures Date of death and date and cause of hospital admissions were identified as described previously.19 We defined incident cardiovascular disease as a hospital admission or death with ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes I60, I61, I63, I64, I21, I21.4, and I21.9. We defined respiratory disease as ICD-10 codes J09-J98 and I26-I27 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as ICD-10 code J44. We defined all cause cancer as an ICD-10 code of C0.0-C9.9, D3.7-9, or D4.0-8 recorded on the cancer registry, death certificate, or hospital admission. We defined cause specific cancers by using the following ICD-10 codes recorded on the cancer registry, death certificate, or hospital admission: breast cancer (C50), prostate cancer (C61), lung cancer (C34), and colorectal cancer (C18, C19, and C20).  Grip strength was measured as previously described,19 and the mean of the right and left values was expressed in absolute units (kg) for subsequent analysis. Physical activity was based on self report, using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form,20 and total physical activity was calculated as the sum of walking and moderate and vigorous activity, measured as metabolic equivalents (MET-min/week). We derived total time spent in sedentary behaviours from the sum of self reported time spent driving, using a computer, and watching television.  Dietary information was collected via the Oxford WebQ, a web based 24 hour recall questionnaire that was developed specifically for use in large population studies.2122 We derived area based socioeconomic status from the postcode of residence, using the Townsend score.23 We calculated age from dates of birth and baseline assessment. We categorised smoking status into never, former, and current smoking. We collected medical history (physician’s diagnosis of depression, stroke, angina, heart attack, hypertension, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or longstanding illness) from the self completed baseline assessment questionnaire. Trained nurses measured height and body weight during the initial assessment centre visit. We calculated body mass index as weight/height2 and used the World Health Organization’s criteria to classify it into categories of underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5 to <25), overweight (25 to <30), obese (30 to <35), obesity class 2 (35 to <40), and obesity class 3 (=40). Trained nurses measured body composition (body fat and fat free mass) by using bio-impedance. Further details of these measurements can be found in the UK Biobank’s online protocol (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk).  Statistical analyses We used multivariable cubic regression splines to visually explore non-linear associations between grip strength and health outcomes. As we found no evidence of deviation from linearity, we investigated the associations of grip strength with cause specific incidence and mortality over follow-up with Cox proportional hazard models. We reported the results as hazard ratios together with 95% confidence intervals. The models for incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer excluded participants with a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, or stroke), respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cancer at baseline, respectively.  Firstly, we treated grip strength as a continuous variable and calculated hazard ratios per 5 kg decrement in grip strength for men and women separately. To enable comparability with other reports in the literature, we also calculated hazard ratios for age and sex specific quarters of grip strength (supplementary table A), with participants in the highest quarter for grip strength used as the reference group. We also did analyses using a sex specific cut-off point for clinically relevant muscle weakness (supplementary table B), as recommended by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Sarcopenia Project.24 We investigated potential sex interactions by fitting a multiplicative interaction term into the models between grip strength (kg) and sex; although we found no significant interactions for the effect of grip strength on health outcomes by sex, we have presented stratified analyses because levels of grip strength differ significantly between woman and men (supplementary table C).  For Cox proportional hazard analyses, we ran four models that included an increasing number of covariates: model 0 (minimally adjusted) included sociodemographic covariates (age, sex, ethnicity, Townsend index, and month of recruitment); model 1 was adjusted as in model 0 but also included height; model 2 was adjusted as in model 1 but also included prevalent morbidity (hypertension, diabetes, depression, and longstanding illness, as well as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer when these were not the outcome); model 3 (fully adjusted) was adjusted as in model 2 but also included lifestyle factors (smoking status, body mass index categories, total physical activity, total sedentary time, and dietary intake of alcohol, fruit and vegetables, oily fish, red meat, and processed meat)....  We then investigated whether these associations differed by age by doing a two way interaction analysis and fitting a handgrip strength*age interaction term to our model. We then repeated our Cox proportional hazard analyses (models 3 and 4) stratified by age categories (=55, 56-65, and >65 years). ...

Patients with these diseases have an increased risk of co-morbid conditions compared with the general population [7, 8], partly explained by the chronic inflammation.

Pulmonary disease [12, 13, 15–17], diabetes [13, 14] and depression [13, 15] are also more common in people with inflammatory RMDs. However, most studies investigating the prevalence of co-morbidities in people with inflammatory RMDs have been undertaken in disease-specific cohorts, and prevalence estimates of co-morbidities vary considerably between studies, partly due to differences in study design, population characteristics and disease ascertainment.  In a nested case–control study using primary care data from the Netherlands [7], patients with inflammatory arthritis were more likely to have cardiovascular disease (odds ratio (OR) 1.4, 95% CI 1.2, 1.5), respiratory disease (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3, 1.8) and depression (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0, 1.4), compared with age- and sex-matched controls without inflammatory arthritis. To gain a better understanding of multimorbidity in general populations, it is important to estimate rates of morbidity in one population using consistent methods for disease ascertainment.  Physical activity has many benefits for patients with inflammatory RMDs, including reducing disease activity and pain, increasing functional capacity and improving psychological health [18, 19], as well as potentially reducing the incidence of some co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoporosis [20]. There is some evidence that patients with inflammatory RMDs are less physically active than the general population [21–23]. However, the relationship between co-morbid diseases and physical activity in patients with different inflammatory RMDs has not been explored in detail. Such data are important for understanding the barriers to physical activity and highlighting the importance of effective co-morbidity screening and management in patients with inflammatory RMDs""","""Musculoskeletal diseases, including chronic rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), are a major global burden, as measured by disability-adjusted life years [1, 2]. The most prevalent inflammatory RMDs are RA, PsA, AS and SLE, with estimated prevalence rates in European adults of 0.8% [3], 0.2% [4], 0.11% [5] and 97 cases per 100 000 population (0.1%) [6], respectively.

We do not know if the differences in outcomes across education groups is because education directly causes these outcomes, by affecting behaviors, such as smoking, or if these differences are due to other factors, such as socioeconomic or genomic differences. Whether education causes differences in outcomes later in life has been the subject of considerable debate by epidemiologists, economists and other social scientists.1–3,7–17 Economists have argued that in addition to its effects on income, a substantial portion of the benefits of education accrue via its potential effects on mortality and morbidity.3 Epidemiologists have found that people who attended university have higher fluid intelligence in adulthood.18 These associations are robust to adjustment for parental social class and adolescent cognition, which has been taken by some as proof that education causes later outcomes.19 Despite this, many epidemiologists and economists are acutely aware that correlations and multivariable adjusted regressions can be unreliable evidence of causation.20–22 The ideal experiment to test this hypothesis, randomizing the age at which children leave school, is unlikely to be ethical, cost-effective, or timely. A more feasible, and potentially robust, research design is to exploit natural experiments that affected when people left school but are not related to confounding factors.23,24 One widely used natural experiment are changes to the legal minimum school leaving age. These changes forced some people to stay in school for longer than they would have otherwise chosen.  In September 1972, the school leaving age increased from age 15 to 16 for children in England. Before the reform, the vast majority of those who left school at age 15 went into the labor force and found employment. The 1971 census indicated that in April 1971 32% of 15-year olds were non-students, of whom 87% were in the labor force. At this time, the unemployment rates in this group were 21.7% and 14.9% for males and females respectively.25 Government discussions at the time of the reform raised concerns at the impact of the immediate withdrawal of 400,000 15-year olds from the labor force as a result of the reform. School leavers at this time were strongly attached to the labor market.26 Researchers have previously used this policy change to investigate the effects of forcing students to stay in school longer using administrative data and longitudinal cohort studies.2,4,27,28 However, the cohort studies had relatively small samples and, as a result, produced relatively imprecise estimates of the effects of education. Previous results from administrative data lacked detailed information needed to identify people born in England affected by the reform, or on many outcomes of interest such as cognition or clinical measures of aging such as grip strength.""","""We do not know whether the differences in outcomes across education groups are because education directly causes these outcomes by affecting behaviours, such as smoking, or whether these differences are due to other factors, such as socioeconomic or genomic differences.

Early development may affect adult susceptibility to a range of non-communicable disease including cardiovascular disease [2] and diabetes [3]. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between prenatal and early childhood development with cognitive, vision and hearing function in middle age. Commonly used indexes of prenatal development include birth weight and other measures of body size at birth. Measures of body size at birth represent an indirect, summative measure of influences on the developing foetus [4]. In contrast to measures of body size at birth (an index of prenatal exposure), measures of adult leg length and height are sensitive to environmental factors and nutrition in early childhood that impact on growth [5].  Birth weight and post-natal growth during early childhood and adolescence are positively associated with cognitive ability in childhood [6–17]. There is less research on whether early life development affects cognitive performance in adulthood and old age, and the findings in the existing literature are mixed. Some studies of middle aged and older adults did not detect reliable associations between early life development and cognitive function in adulthood and older age [18–20]. One possible explanation may be that early life development exerts a stronger influence on cognition in childhood than later in life. Richards and colleagues [16] assessed cognitive function in 3,900 participants at ages 8, 11, 15, 26 and 43 years. Birth weight was positively associated with cognitive ability at 8, 11, 15 and 26 years, though there was no association at 43 years. Other studies do support associations between both prenatal [21,22] and childhood [22,23] development and adult cognitive function. In summary, there is inconsistent evidence that pre-natal growth may affect cognitive ability in adulthood. Previous research findings are also inconsistent in relation to early life development and age-related change in cognitive function. Martyn et al [19] and Shenkin et al [20] reported no association between any anthropometric parameter at birth and estimated cognitive decline. Gale and colleagues [24] found associations between cognitive decline and adult head circumference, but not head circumference at birth.  To date, most research attention has focused on the long-term cognitive outcomes of low birth weight babies and birth weight within the normal range. However, there is also evidence that unusually large babies may have poorer cognitive outcomes. Large babies are defined as being outside the normal range of distribution according to weight, head circumference or length (i.e. greater than the 90th percentile or 97th percentile, depending on the cut-point used [25]). Maternal diabetes and obesity are associated with higher likelihood of a large baby [26]. Cesur and Rashad [27] analysed two longitudinal data sets, examining patterns of academic performance in junior school for a combined sample of 19,280 children. Children who had either low or high birth weight had poorer academic performance compared to children within the normal range of birth weight. Given increasing rates of diabetes and obesity globally [28,29] and parallel evidence of increasing numbers of babies who are large for gestational age [30], adverse developmental outcomes associated with overweight babies is likely to assume increased importance.  Few studies have investigated associations between early life development and hearing and visual sensory function. Birth weight was reported to be associated with likelihood of having state registration for hearing impairment [31], hearing and visual acuity [32] and self-reported hearing problems [33]. Sayer et al [34] reported that reduced growth in childhood (but not birth weight) was associated with lens opacity (but not visual acuity) and poorer hearing levels when assessed around age 67 years. Barrenas [35] reported that adult height was associated with hearing, and concluded that adverse early life experience may convey increased susceptibility to hearing loss in adulthood. However, not all studies support associations between prenatal and/or childhood development and adult sensory function; Ecob and colleagues [36] reported no association between birth weight or BMI during childhood and hearing assessed at age 45 years.  It may be that the association between indices of early life development and adult cognition and sensory function is due to confounding; factors including socio-economic status or birth trauma may account for the association, despite attempts to control statistically for potential confounds. However, there is evidence from experimental studies with animal models that supports observational findings in humans for the influence of early life exposures on development of cognitive and sensory systems [37]. It is plausible that there is a direct causal relationship between early development and neurosensory function in adulthood, although the mechanism is unclear. It may be that under-nutrition impacts on development of the brain and sensory organs [38], or there may be alterations in gene expression that affect cognitive and sensory function [39–41]. Alternatively, glucocorticoid hormones or growth factors may be modulated by early experience and impact on neurosensory development [35,42–44]. It is also possible that the effect of early development on cognitive and sensory function is via increased susceptibility to diabetes and cardiovascular disease; adverse early development is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes [2,3], and cognitive decline and poor hearing and visual function are independently associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes [45–48].

Briefly, fifteen sets of three monosyllabic digits were presented over circumaural headphones (Sennheiser HD-25). Participants first set the volume of the stimuli to a comfortable level. Each ear was tested separately with the order of testing randomised across participants. Digits were presented in a background of noise shaped to match the spectrum of the speech stimuli. Noise levels varied adaptively, contingent on recognition of the three digits, to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a criterion performance of 50% correct. The speech recognition threshold was calculated from the mean SNR for the last eight triplets. Lower (more negative) scores represent better performance. The recognition threshold for the better ear was used as the index of hearing.  Vision Visual acuity testing was based on reading high contrast letters with the participant seated at a distance of 4 metres. Visual acuity measures were completed on both eyes.

As with other diseases that are linked to early development, cognitive and sensory function appears to be influenced by the full range of development; not just those within the extremely deprived range, but also those within the normal range. In models of infectious disease, individuals remain healthy until they contract the disease. In contrast, non-communicable diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment and sensory impairment develop gradually over the life course. Early development may programme a metabolic trajectory for the lifespan which interacts with accumulated challenges to health (such as obesity, smoking or hypertension [35]) and age-related declines in physiological plasticity [65]. One implication of this model is that the effectiveness of interventions in adulthood are relatively limited, while intervention in a developmentally more plastic period is likely to have a much larger impact in altering the metabolic trajectory and preventing disease [65]. In order to reduce the burden of cognitive decline and sensory impairment, future research attention may centre on identifying avenues for intervention to optimise foetal growth and childhood development [62]. Public health policy should also take into account the importance of focusing on interventions during early life, with potentially greater effect than attempting to mitigate cognitive decline and sensory impairment in adulthood and older age.""","""Sensory and cognitive impairments in older age are a substantial and increasing source of poor quality of life and economic costs globally [64].

Secondary outcome variables Official data from the National Health Service’s Centre Registry were used to develop two binary (yes/no) secondary outcomes measures: all-cause mortality and CVD-related mortality.  Exposures The study exposures were represented by seven chronic inflammatory disorders, namely RA, psoriasis, Crohn’s disease, UC, SLE, systemic vasculitis and AS. These measures were based on participants self-report of a clinician diagnosis and were developed into separate binary variables (yes/no). To test the hypothesis that cardiometabolic events and mortality rates may vary with anti-inflammatory therapy and disorder duration, two additional variables were developed for each inflammatory disorder. A therapy variable that used anti-inflammatory prescribing data to classify participants into: no anti-inflammatory therapy, NSAIDs or corticosteroids only therapy, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). An inflammatory disorder duration variable based on the number of years from inflammatory disorder diagnosis to the year of the UK Biobank assessment. This variable grouped participants into tertiles of inflammatory disorder duration.  Covariates Because of the cross-sectional nature of the data at baseline, the study covariates included sociodemographic characteristics, specifically age (continuous measure), gender (female vs male), deprivation, education and ethnicity. Deprivation was based on Townsend deprivation indices derived from aggregated data on car ownership, household overcrowding, owner occupation and unemployment (higher scores represent higher degree of deprivation). For the present study, participants were grouped into quintiles of deprivation. Education (options included degree, Advanced(A) levels/Advanced Subsidiary(AS) levels, O levels/General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), Certificate of Secondary Education (CSEs), National Vocational Qualification (NVQ)/Higher National Diploma (HND)/Higher National Certificate (HNC) or none) was included as a binary variable comparing participants with a degree or professional qualification with those with other qualifications.15 Self-reported ethnicity classified participants into white, Asian (eg, India, Pakistan or Bangladesh), Chinese, black, or mixed/other. Lifestyle factors (eg, smoking, physical activity, diet, obesity) are important risk factors for CVD, however, because these were measured at the date of assessment adjusting for them in the analysis may have introduced bias (their value is likely to have changed over time). As educational level is related to lifestyle factors, we adjusted for this factor in the analyses. Two additional binary (yes/no) covariates were included in the sensitivity analyses: self-reported antihypertensive therapy and lipid-lowering therapy. Data on the prevalence of atherogenic risk factors (eg, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, dyslipidaemia) are provided in the online supplementary table S1.""",,Yes,No,,"""A cumulative cardiometabolic measure that classified patients into those with at least one cardiometabolic event (1) versus those without an event (0); and a multiple cardiometabolic measure that grouped participants into those with two or more cardiometabolic events (1) versus those with one or no cardiometabolic event (0)...Official data from the National Health Service’s Centre Registry were used to develop two binary (yes/no) secondary outcomes measures: all-cause mortality and CVD-related mortality....

Multivariable binomial regression analysis was used to estimate the cross-sectional association between each inflammatory disorder with each primary cardiometabolic outcome measure. The same modelling strategy was used to estimate the association between anti-inflammatory therapy and length of exposure. Binomial regression modelling was preferred to logistic regression as it allows an estimation of the relative risk of study outcomes, the preferred estimate when the outcomes’ incidence is common.16 The analyses adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity and educational level. Sensitivity analyses adjusting (in addition to study covariates) for antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs were also performed.  Prospective study Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate differences in all-cause and CVD-related mortality rates between participants with and without a diagnosis of chronic inflammatory disorder. These analyses adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity and educational level. Participants entered the study at the time of baseline assessment and exited at the time of death or study end. The proportionality assumption was tested using Schoenfeld residuals and was found not to be violated. Sensitivity analyses excluding participants with cardiometabolic disorders at baseline were also performed (data available from the authors).  Within both cross-sectional and prospective studies, random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain a pooled estimate of the relative risk of primary and secondary outcomes within specific inflammatory disorders. Because adjustment for multiple comparisons could increase the risk of type II errors,17 we have interpreted statistical significance within the context of the magnitude of association and previous research findings.17 Because less than 0.01% of the data were missing, complete case analyses were performed.

Adjusting for critical socioeconomic inequalities, the present study findings endorsed the increased risk of cardiometabolic events (eg, CHD, stroke, T2DM) within specific chronic inflammatory disorders and extended these associations to other disorders (eg, AS) and outcome measures (eg, PAD, VTE). A notable finding was that participants diagnosed with pathologically diverse inflammatory disorders were at greater risk of both multiple and cumulative cardiometabolic events compared with their counterparts without inflammatory disorders. The large effect size observed for PAD outcome (specifically within the SLE disorder) relative to other outcome measures (ie, CHD, stroke) indicates a possible strong association, however, the wide confidence intervals questions the precision of the estimates. This association would benefit, thus, from confirmation with larger prospective studies.  Overall, these associations were stronger among participants who were prescribed NSAIDs or corticosteroids, potentially reflecting the increased CVD risk associated with some of these drugs. Participants who were prescribed DMARDs also presented greater rates of cardiometabolic events, but the magnitude of the association was lower. Confounding by indication may explain the findings for DMARDs, given their prescribing indication for patients with more severe underlying inflammation. This suggestion is supported by the evidence of no increased cardiometabolic risk among participants who did not report anti-inflammatory therapies. Patients prescribed DMARDs are likely also to be prescribed NSAIDs or corticosteroids to alleviate disorder-related pain. Thus, the association may be confounded by the increased cardiometabolic risk confer by NSAIDs or corticosteroid drugs.18 Certain DMARDs (eg, leflunomide and ciclosporin) have also been linked with increased risk of hypertension,19 which may also account for the observed association.  A dose-response association was observed with respect to the duration of inflammatory disorder. Specifically, the risk of cardiometabolic events increased with the duration of RA, SLE, and systemic vasculitis (cumulative outcome) disorders. A reverse trend was apparent, however, within Crohn’s disease, UC and psoriasis (cumulative events) disorders. This reverse trend may be due to an effective disorder management that may obscure a potential association between disorder duration with cardiometabolic risk. There are also suggestions that reduced CVD risk with longer Crohn’s disease duration may be due to progression from an inflammatory to a fibrostenotic disorder phenotype.20  The simultaneous investigation of cumulative and multiple cardiometabolic risk within pathologically diverse inflammatory disorders is rarely available.1 21 Using a primary-care population, we have recently1 identified an increased risk of multiple CVD events within specific inflammatory disorders. The present study documented similar patterns within a community-based population and extended these findings to multiple cardiometabolic outcomes and additional disorders (eg, AS). Previous research associated methotrexate use with lower CVD risk.22 23 The present study findings imply increased cardiometabolic risk among DMARDs treated participants in line with Ogdie et al findings.21 The eclectic definition of DMARDs (eg, methotrexate, ciclosporin, leflunomide, azathioprine) in this study may mask the impact of specific DMARDs on cardiometabolic risk. The study findings are in line with prior studies24 suggested a decline in CVD risk associated with increased duration of Crohn’s disease and UC, while the reverse trend was suggested among SLE.25  Secondary outcome measures: prospective findings With the exception of UC, participants diagnosed with inflammatory disorders presented higher rates of all-cause and CVD-related mortality events relative to inflammatory disorder-free participants. These findings are consistent with prior evidence based on smaller samples.4 26 27""","""The aim of the present study was to replicate in a community-setting the relationship between specific chronic inflammatory disorders with cardiometabolic outcomes documented in a primary care context, using a similar methodological approach.

We examined the associations of social isolation and loneliness with all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazard models with age as a timescale. Associations with cause-specific mortality were examined using competing-risks survival regression (based on Fine and Gray's proportional sub-hazards model), which is the appropriate method for estimation of competing actual risks.19 All the models were adjusted for age, sex, and ethnic origin, with additional adjustment for chronic disease. To measure the robustness of these associations, we did additional subgroup analyses separately for men and women, three age groups (37–52 years, 53–60 years, and 61–73 years), different ethnic groups (white vs non-white), and participants with and without chronic disease at baseline. Subgroup analyses by sex, age, ethnic origin, and chronic disease were chosen because these factors represent potential confounders for the association between social relations and mortality. Men, individuals belonging to ethnic minorities, elderly people, and those with long-standing illness tend to have fewer social relations and also are at increased risk of mortality.4,  6 Similar three-level age categorisations have been used in a previous study based on UK Biobank data.20 To assess the extent to which baseline biological, behavioural, socioeconomic, psychological, and health-related risk factors explained the associations of social isolation and loneliness with mortality, we calculated the percentage of excess risk mediated (PERM) for the following five groups of explanatory variables: (1) biological (BMI, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and handgrip strength); (2) behavioural (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity); (3) socioeconomic (Townsend deprivation index, education, and household income); (4) psychological factors (depressive symptoms and cognitive performance); and (5) self-rated health.

Finally, all the risk factors were included in the same model simultaneously (final model). To assess the extent to which the associations followed a dose–response pattern, we did dose–response analyses using sum scores from the individual items of the isolation and loneliness measures. We analysed isolation and loneliness separately to assess whether there was a pattern across the continuous score as a predictor of mortality. We accounted for missing data by multiple imputation by chained equations, which generated five imputed datasets.22 The imputation model included age, sex, social isolation, loneliness, all confounding and mediating variables, the Nelson-Aalen estimate of cumulative hazard, and survival status.23 We fitted Cox proportional hazards models within each imputed dataset and combined them in accordance with Rubin's rules.

For example, although deprived populations have the highest prevalence of multiple co-occurring adverse lifestyle factors and the highest premature mortality,2,  3 the prevalence of lifestyle factors only partially explains the increased mortality associated with deprivation.4 Study of the synergistic interaction between lifestyle factors and deprivation might improve our understanding of the excess mortality associated with deprivation. For example, individuals from deprived groups have an increased risk of harm from the same amount of alcohol consumed even after controlling for drinking patterns, body-mass index, and smoking.5 Similarly, deprived populations are disproportionately affected by the harmful effects of smoking and physical inactivity.6,  7 Mechanisms underlying this disproportionate lifestyle harm remain unclear but might include extremes of unhealthy lifestyle factors,8 interactions with other factors associated with deprivation (such as psychosocial stress),9 and reduced access to health services.10 However, previous studies of interactions between lifestyle factors and deprivation have examined only smoking, alcohol intake, and physical inactivity.5,  6,  7 Numerous individual lifestyle factors are associated with mortality; however, combinations of lifestyle factors interact synergistically, resulting in stronger associations with mortality.11 Evidence from the past 3 years has emphasised a role for emerging factors, such as sleep duration and television viewing time.12,  13 Combining emerging and traditional factors (smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, and diet) in extended lifestyle scores shows that a high proportion of deaths are due to modifiable factors and are therefore avoidable, highlighting new targets for public health intervention.14 To our knowledge, interactions between deprivation and extended combinations of lifestyle factors that include emerging factors have not been investigated.

Trained nurses measured blood pressure, height, and bodyweight during the initial assessment. WHO criteria were applied to classify body-mass index into underweight (<18·5 kg/m2), normal weight (18·5–24·9 kg/m2), overweight (25·0–29·9 kg/m2), and obese (=30·0 kg/m2).19 Available data for lifestyle factors in UK Biobank were used to generate a lifestyle score using smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, television viewing time, sleep duration, fruit and vegetable intake, oily fish intake, and red and processed meat intake. This score was based on a previously published score from an Australian cohort of 267 079 adults, which represented the sum of each dichotomised lifestyle variable (0 points if not at risk, 1 point if at risk), resulting in a risk score range of 0–6, in which a higher score indicated higher risk (appendix).14 UK Biobank data collection precluded using exactly the same lifestyle variables so the score was adapted. Lifestyle variables comprising the score were derived from questionnaire responses (appendix). If available, we used national guidelines to generate healthy and unhealthy categories for each lifestyle factor.

However, cardiovascular disease mortality is a composite measure of both cardiovascular disease incidence and survival; because deprivation is associated with both of these outcomes, the modifying effect of deprivation might, as a result, be stronger for mortality than for incidence, which includes both fatal and non-fatal events. An alternative explanation for this non-significant interaction might lie in the socioeconomic status differential in health-care-seeking behaviour, which results in under-reporting of non-fatal cardiovascular disease events in more deprived groups, whereas fatal events are less likely to be under-reported because all deaths are recorded in the UK. Previous qualitative research has shown that individuals from more deprived areas tend not to present to health services in response to chest pain, sometimes because of a perception of health service overuse.26 Here, the number and proportion of events generally increased with deprivation for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality despite fewer participants in more deprived groups (table 3). Although a similar pattern was seen for cardiovascular disease incidence, with the proportion of events increasing with deprivation, the absolute number of events did not increase with deprivation. This could represent under-reporting of non-fatal cardiovascular disease events in more deprived groups.

The large size of the cohort allowed us to exclude individuals with self-reported non-communicable diseases at baseline as well as those who died within 2 years of recruitment while maintaining sufficient participant numbers and statistical power. These strategies reduce the chance that our results are due to reverse causality (ie, poor health leading to unhealthy lifestyles and adverse outcomes), although the possibility remains in this observational study.

Consequently, summary statistics such as prevalence cannot be generalised to the wider UK population; however, estimates of the strength of associations can be generalised.27 Presence of a non-communicable disease at baseline and therefore exclusion from the final survival models was based on self-report; therefore, misreporting might have biased results. However, misreporting might be less likely because diagnosis was based on a physician's diagnosis and was discussed at interview with a trained nurse.

In this New Zealand-based trial of calcium supplementation in older women, increased risk of myocardial infarction with calcium supplementation was demonstrated.5 Subsequent meta-analyses and a reanalysis of the Women's Health Initiative trial by the same group again demonstrated modest associations between calcium, or calcium and vitamin D, supplementation and increased risk of myocardial infarction but not cardiovascular death.6, 7 In contrast, no statistically significant associations between calcium and vitamin D supplementation and cardiac outcomes were found in a similar meta-analysis by Lewis and colleagues8 or by investigators studying the Women's Health Initiative.9-11 However, in the Lewis study, a subanalysis among the much smaller number of individuals randomized to calcium alone did suggest an increased risk of myocardial infarction with use of calcium supplements alone versus placebo.

The device has good reliability and reproducibility.21 Staff calibrated the device at the start of each measurement day. Each participant was asked to sit upright on a chair with their forearm on the armrest, and then grasp the handle of the device in their right hand. They were required to maintain a 90° angle of their elbow adjacent to their side so that their thumb would face upwards, while squeezing the handle as strongly as possible for ~3 s. The same protocol was performed with the left hand. For the current analysis, we used average values of the two hands; unless the value from only one hand was available (n=233). Sex- and age-specific quintiles of GS were generated for analyses (Supplementary Table 1).  Adiposity measures Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing measured weight (kg) by measured height squared (m2). Waist circumference (WC) was measured by a tape measure at the level of the umbilicus. For the present analyses, BMI (kg m-2) was categorised as normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9), obesity class I (30.0–34.9) and obesity class II (<U+2A7E>35.0). A total of 62 men and 373 women who were underweight (BMI<18.5 kg m-2) were excluded from the analyses because of small sample size. Three categories of WC were generated according to the following sex-specific cut points: <U+2A7D>79.9 cm, 80.0–87.9 cm and <U+2A7E>88.0 cm for women, and <U+2A7D>93.9 cm, 94.0–101.9 cm and <U+2A7E>102.0 cm for men.22""",subheadings in methods,TRUE,TRUE,,,,Yes,Yes,"""Physical activity outcomes Accelerometer data collection An invitation to participate in the PA sub-study was emailed between February 2013 and December 2015 to 236 519 participants who had given a valid email address upon recruitment. Participants in the North West region who had been involved in other sub-studies were not invited for accelerometer measurement due to the potential participant burden. Enclosed in an envelope, a tri-axial accelerometer (Axivity AX3, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK23) configured to capture three-dimensional acceleration at 100 Hz with a dynamic range of ±8 g was mailed, along with instructions on proper use of the device, to consenting participants, who were asked to start wearing the monitor on the dominant wrist (defined as the hand that participants typically use to write) upon receipt and for the next 7 days. Devices were programmed to start and finish recording at pre-specified times. Participants were requested to send the monitor back to the co-ordinating centre in a provided pre-paid envelope at the end of the 7-day monitoring period.  Accelerometer data processing Raw accelerometry data were calibrated to local gravity (1 g) with temperature compensation17 and filtered to dampen machine noise using a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20 Hz. Euclidean Norm Minus One was calculated as the Euclidean Norm (vector magnitude) of the acceleration in three axes minus one gravitational unit (1 g), with any negative values truncated to zero. Non-wear was identified as time periods of <U+2A7E>60 min where standard deviations of all three axes were <13.0 milli-g (1 milli-g=0.001 g). Overall PA volume (average Euclidean Norm Minus One) and intensity distribution (5-sec resolution) were summarised for each individual activity record, while minimising diurnal bias caused by non-wear.24 Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was defined as Euclidean Norm Minus One values greater than 125 milli-g, and expressed in min day-1. Participants with <72 h of wear time or Euclidean Norm Minus One <U+2A7E>500 milli-g were excluded from the analysis.

Enclosed in an envelope, a tri-axial accelerometer (Axivity AX3, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK23) configured to capture three-dimensional acceleration at 100 Hz with a dynamic range of ±8 g was mailed, along with instructions on proper use of the device, to consenting participants, who were asked to start wearing the monitor on the dominant wrist (defined as the hand that participants typically use to write) upon receipt and for the next 7 days. Devices were programmed to start and finish recording at pre-specified times. Participants were requested to send the monitor back to the co-ordinating centre in a provided pre-paid envelope at the end of the 7-day monitoring period.  Accelerometer data processing Raw accelerometry data were calibrated to local gravity (1 g) with temperature compensation17 and filtered to dampen machine noise using a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20 Hz. Euclidean Norm Minus One was calculated as the Euclidean Norm (vector magnitude) of the acceleration in three axes minus one gravitational unit (1 g), with any negative values truncated to zero. Non-wear was identified as time periods of <U+2A7E>60 min where standard deviations of all three axes were <13.0 milli-g (1 milli-g=0.001 g). Overall PA volume (average Euclidean Norm Minus One) and intensity distribution (5-sec resolution) were summarised for each individual activity record, while minimising diurnal bias caused by non-wear.24 Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was defined as Euclidean Norm Minus One values greater than 125 milli-g, and expressed in min day-1. Participants with <72 h of wear time or Euclidean Norm Minus One <U+2A7E>500 milli-g were excluded from the analysis. Previous research found wrist-worn accelerometry to be valid for assessing PA intensity25 and energy expenditure.18, 26  Covariates We included the following variables as covariates in the analysis: age, ethnicity (White, mixed, Asian/Asian British, Black/Black British, others), smoking status (never, previous, current), alcohol consumption (never, previous, currently <3 times/week, currently <U+2A7E>3 times/week), employment (unemployed and employed), Townsend Area Deprivation Index (a composite score of employment, car ownership, home ownership and household overcrowding, with higher values indicating a given area’s higher degree of deprivation), severe medical conditions (any of heart attack/stroke/cancer), follow-up time (between baseline assessment and accelerometry measurement), monitor wear time (hours/day), season of accelerometer wear (two orthogonal sine functions), TV time (60-min increments) and baseline self-reported MVPA (min per day). Self-reported MVPA time was calculated as the sum of walking time, non-walking moderate (frequency × duration), and vigorous (frequency × duration) activity time, all of which were reported through questions adapted from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.27  Statistical analyses Characteristics of the participants at baseline were summarised by sex and BMI category. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the associations of adiposity and GS with the two PA outcomes of average acceleration and MVPA. First, models were fit to estimate associations of adiposity (BMI and WC) with PA, with adjustment for age (Model 1). Remaining aforementioned covariates were additionally adjusted for in subsequent models (Model 2), and finally GS was added (Model 3). A parallel series of models using GS as the primary exposure variable were fit with adjustment for age (Model 1) and additional adjustment for remaining covariates (Model 2), with final adjustment for BMI (Model 3). The GS-activity associations were also estimated, stratified by BMI or WC category, and in parallel the adiposity-activity associations were estimated, stratified by GS quintile (all adjusted for the same covariates as in Model 3); interactions between each exposure and the stratification variable were tested using a multiplication term. All exposure variables were standardised for each sex to facilitate comparison of the strength of association found for different exposures with the same outcome variable. The two PA outcome variables were log-transformed, as the models using untransformed outcome variables did not meet assumptions of normality and heteroscedasticity of residuals.

This study aimed to determine longitudinal associations of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and grip strength (GS) with objectively measured PA.  Subjects/Methods: Data are from the UK Biobank study. At baseline (2006–2010), BMI, WC and GS were objectively measured. At follow-up (2013–2015), a sub-sample of 93 015 participants (52 161 women) wore a tri-axial accelerometer on the dominant wrist for 7 days. Linear regression was performed to investigate longitudinal associations of standardised BMI, WC and GS at baseline with moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and acceleration after a median 5.7-years follow-up (interquartile range: 4.9–6.5 years).  Results: Linear regression revealed strong inverse associations for BMI and WC, and positive associations for GS with follow-up PA; in women, MVPA ranges from lowest to highest quintiles of GS were 42–48 min day-1 in severely obese (BMI<U+2A7E>35 kg m-2), 52–57 min day-1 in obese (30<U+2A7D>BMI<35 kg m-2), 61–65 min day-1 in overweight (25<U+2A7D>BMI<30 kg m-2) and 69–75 min day-1 in normal weight (18.5<U+2A7D>BMI<25 kg m-2). Follow-up MVPA was also lower in the lowest GS quintile (42–69 min day-1) compared with the highest GS quintile (48–75 min day-1) across BMI categories in women. The pattern of these associations was generally consistent for men, and in analyses using WC and mean acceleration as exposure and outcome, respectively.  Conclusions: More pronounced obesity and poor strength at baseline independently predict lower activity levels at follow-up. Interventions and policies should aim to improve body composition and muscle strength to promote active living.  Download PDF Introduction Increasing physical activity (PA) levels is an important public health priority as physical inactivity is associated with increased risks of mortality as well as cardiovascular events.1 Studies2, 3, 4 have been performed to examine correlates and determinants of PA in order to inform interventions and policies aimed at increasing PA levels. Of various genetic, biological, behavioural and environmental factors influencing PA, adiposity was found to be inversely associated with PA in previous cross-sectional studies.5, 6, 7, 8 Some longitudinal studies reported that higher adiposity levels at baseline were associated with lower PA levels at follow-up.9, 10, 11, 12  In addition to adiposity, grip strength (GS), as a proxy measure for overall muscle strength,13 has been known to be a correlate of PA.8, 14, 15 The longer-term relationship between GS and self-report PA has been examined in one previous longitudinal study.16 In fact, all but one10 prior longitudinal studies9, 11, 12, 16 in this area of research employed self-report methods to quantify PA, which are more susceptible to measurement errors compared with the objective measures of PA, such as accelerometers. Accelerometers provide more accurate estimates of PA,17, 18 thereby making it easier to disentangle the true associations between PA, adiposity and GS. Moreover, there has been no longitudinal investigation to examine the interplay of adiposity and GS relative to objectively assessed PA. Future PA may be more dependent upon baseline adiposity than strength or vice versa. Hence, it is critical from both epidemiological and public health perspectives to understand the relative contribution of adiposity and GS to PA, in order to promote physically active lifestyles. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the independent and joint longitudinal associations of adiposity and GS with objectively measured PA in middle-aged and older adults participating in a large-scale prospective cohort.  Methods Study design and participants This study uses data collected from the UK Biobank study, which is an ongoing national cohort study of >500 000 UK adults aged 40–69 years at recruitment. The inclusion criteria included living <25 miles away from one of 22 assessment centres across the UK and being registered with the National Health Service. Each participant underwent baseline measurements between 2006 and 2010 collecting a comprehensive series of genetic, behavioural and biological variables, including measurements of body composition and GS. Several years later (2013–2015), 103 720 of the cohort participated in a sub-study in which their PA was objectively measured by wrist accelerometry.19 More detailed descriptions about the rationales and methodology of the UK Biobank project are provided elsewhere.20 Each participant signed informed consent before participation. The UK Biobank protocol was approved by the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee.  Exposures Grip strength (GS) GS was assessed once in each hand using a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Jamar J00105, Lafayette, IN, USA), which can measure isometric grip force up to 90 kilograms. The device has good reliability and reproducibility.21 Staff calibrated the device at the start of each measurement day. Each participant was asked to sit upright on a chair with their forearm on the armrest, and then grasp the handle of the device in their right hand. They were required to maintain a 90° angle of their elbow adjacent to their side so that their thumb would face upwards, while squeezing the handle as strongly as possible for ~3 s. The same protocol was performed with the left hand. For the current analysis, we used average values of the two hands; unless the value from only one hand was available (n=233). Sex- and age-specific quintiles of GS were generated for analyses (Supplementary Table 1).  Adiposity measures Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing measured weight (kg) by measured height squared (m2). Waist circumference (WC) was measured by a tape measure at the level of the umbilicus. For the present analyses, BMI (kg m-2) was categorised as normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9), obesity class I (30.0–34.9) and obesity class II (<U+2A7E>35.0). A total of 62 men and 373 women who were underweight (BMI<18.5 kg m-2) were excluded from the analyses because of small sample size. Three categories of WC were generated according to the following sex-specific cut points: <U+2A7D>79.9 cm, 80.0–87.9 cm and <U+2A7E>88.0 cm for women, and <U+2A7D>93.9 cm, 94.0–101.9 cm and <U+2A7E>102.0 cm for men.22  Physical activity outcomes Accelerometer data collection An invitation to participate in the PA sub-study was emailed between February 2013 and December 2015 to 236 519 participants who had given a valid email address upon recruitment.

Age, sex, smoking, body mass index, and history of esophageal conditions or treatments identified individuals who developed EAC (AUROC, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.77–0.82). We used these factors to develop a scoring system and identified a point cut off that 104,723 individuals (29.5%), including 170 of the 220 cases with EAC, were above. The scoring system identified individuals who developed EAC with 77.4% sensitivity and 70.5% specificity. The 5-year risk of EAC was 0.16% for individuals with scores above the threshold and 0.02% for individuals with scores below the threshold.  Conclusion We combined data on several well-established risk factors that are available to clinicians to develop a system to identify individuals with a higher absolute risk of EAC within 5 years.

To assess whether a more complex model increased model performance (AUROC), additional factors not widely available to clinicians or that may require additional examination were added to the initial model in turn (excluding individuals with missing data) and then with all factors significant at P < .1 added to a stepwise selection model.  A priori sensitivity/secondary analyses assessed the AUROC and stepwise model selection when the following: • including individuals with a history of non-upper gastrointestinal cancers;  • conducting multiple imputation for missing variables (using 10 imputations and combined using Rubin’s rules);  • using different cancer follow-up periods;  • using different age periods;  • using different categories for smoking and BMI and separate variables for each esophageal condition;  • stratifying by age, sex, BMI, smoking history, and esophageal condition status at baseline to check model performance for importance patient subgroups; and  • excluding individuals who reported a history of Barrett’s esophagus or esophagitis because these may already be undergoing endoscopic surveillance.   Further secondary analyses assessed the discriminative ability of the risk-prediction model identified in the primary analyses for total upper gastrointestinal cancer, because the tool could be used as triage to endoscopy, which could detect all types of gastric and esophageal cancers. For comparison we also used stepwise logistic regression to estimate factors widely available to clinicians associated with risk of total upper gastrointestinal cancer within 5 years (P < .1) and assessed the discriminative ability of a new points-based model.

IntroductionInsomnia is defined as persistent difficulties with sleep initi-ation and/or maintenance, resulting in significant impairment todaytime functioning.

Insomnia has also beenassociated with a range of serious and non-serious sleep-relatedaccidents[7].While experimental sleep loss engenders reliable cognitiveimpairment, particularly for vigilance, complex attention, andworking memory[8], there has been comparatively little work oninsomnia. In general, thefield has been characterised by mixedfindings, with some studies showing impairment and othersfailing to observe differences from controls[9].

Assessmentswere conducted at 22 centres across England, Scotland, and Walesbetween 2006 and 2010. Questionnaires and cognitive assessmentswere administered in a standardised order using a computerisedtouchscreen interface, followed by a face-to-face interview with aresearch nurse to obtain additional data. Sleep-related variablesand cognitive performance were assessed in a single visit thatlasted approximately 90 min.2.3. Sleep-related variablesTo assess insomnia symptoms, participants were asked‘Do youhave trouble falling asleep at night or do you wake up in themiddle of the night?’with responses‘never/rarely’,‘sometimes’and‘usually’. Participants were categorised as having frequentinsomnia symptoms if they answered‘usually’to this question,while the remaining participants made up the control groupwithout frequent insomnia symptoms. Chronotype was assessedusing the following question:‘Do you consider yourself to be’...:‘definitely a“morning”person’,‘more a“morning”than“evening”person’,‘more an“evening”than“morning”person’,‘definitely an“evening”person’. For the purposes of the present study, wecollapsed the two middle responses into an‘intermediate’chro-notype category, permitting comparisons with the‘definitelymorning’and‘definitely evening’groups. Sleep duration wasrecorded as the number of reported hours to the following ques-tion:‘About how many hours sleep do you get in every 24 h? (include naps)’. Given previously established U-shape relationshipswith health and cognition[20], we categorised sleep duration intoshort (<7 h), normal (7e9h)andlong(>9 h) based on recentguidelines[21].2.4. Cognitive performanceFive cognitive measures were administered through a compu-terised touchscreen interface[22]. Time to complete allfivecognitive tests was approximately 15 min. The tests were designedspecifically for the UK Biobank to allow administration at scalewithout examiner supervision. The tasks show evidence of an un-derlying performance factor and good stability over time, with theexception of visual memory performance, which has a compara-tively lower intraclass correlation coefficient[22]. Thefive tasks involved the following instructions:Reasoning: This task assessed the ability to solve 13 verbal andnumeric reasoning problems. Each problem hadfive possibleresponse options. The dependent variable was the total numberof correct answers given (range 0e13) within a 2-min period,with higher scores indicating better performance.Basic reaction time: This task was delivered in the style of thecard game,‘snap’, and requested participants to respond with abutton press when they detected the appearance of a matchingpair of symbols. The dependent variable was the mean responsetime in milliseconds across 12 matching-pair trials. RT valueswere log-transformed because of skewed distribution (ln x).Numeric short-term memory: In this task, a string of numberswas presented on the screen, which subsequently disappeared.Participants were then asked to enter the number string frommemory, in the reverse order, through a keypad. The dependentvariable was the maximum string length recalled correctly(range: 0e12), with higher scores indicating better perfor-mance. The test was discontinued afterfive successive incorrectresponses at string length¼2.Visual memory: In this task, six card pairs of symbols were pre-sented on-screen in a random pattern. Cards were then turnedface down on the screen, and participants were asked to locate asmany symbol pairs as possible in as few attempts as possible. Thedependent variable was the number of errors made during pairsmatching (range 0e146), which was log-transformed because ofskewed distribution and zero inflation (ln (xþ1)).Prospective memory: In this task, participants were asked toremember to perform a pre-planned instruction. Specifically, atthe beginning of the test battery, they were presented with thefollowing instruction:‘At the end of the games we will show youfour coloured symbols and ask you to touch the blue square.However, to test your memory, we want you to actually touch theorange circle instead’. If participants remembered to touch theorange circle onfirst attempt, they were coded as‘correct’(1),while those failing to do so were set to 0.2.5. Demographic dataDemographic data included age, sex, and neighbourhood-levelsocioeconomic status as measured by the Townsend index of ma-terial deprivation. For statistical analyses, socioeconomic status waslog-transformed because of skewed distribution by using an‘ln(xþ7)’equation (minimum of non-transformed index:6.26).Educational qualifications were recorded and were dichotomisedaccording to whether participants held a college/university degree.We also included body mass index (BMI) as a covariate in adjustedanalyses.2.6. Medication and clinical dataCurrent medications were self-reported to the research nurse,and the participants were dichotomised according to whether theywere taking sleep medication (sedatives and hypnotics), any otherpsychotropic medication (mood stabilisers, antidepressants, andantipsychotics) or antihypertensive medication (ACE inhibitors,angiotensin II antagonists, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers,and diuretics). Current depressive symptoms were assessed usingthe following question:‘Over the past two weeks, how often haveyou felt down, depressed or hopeless?’, with the followingresponse options:‘not at all’,‘several days’,‘more than half thedays’or‘nearly every day’. For the purpose of the present analyses,those scoring‘several days’,‘more than half the days’or‘nearlyevery day’were coded in the‘depressive symptoms’category, whilethose scoring‘not at all’were considered in the‘no depressivesymptoms’category. In addition, participants were dichotomisedaccording to whether they reported hypertension or any cardio-vascular disease.2.7. AnalysesDescriptive data presentation included mean values and stan-dard deviations and the proportion of the sample reporting specificquestionnaire response options. Questionnaire response options,‘do not know’or‘prefer not to answer’, were handled as missingvalues. For cognitive dependent variables, the sample size variedacross tests because the reasoning and prospective memory testswere added after the commencement of data collection, while thenumeric memory task was included from the outset but subse-quently removed because of time constraints.In afirst step (unadjusted analyses, model 1), the associationbetween insomnia status (those with frequent insomnia symptomsvs. those without frequent insomnia symptoms) and cognitiveperformance was analysed using four linear models, with insomniastatus as the single predictor variable and reasoning, basic reactiontime, numeric memory, and visual memory as dependent variables.The association between insomnia status and prospective memoryperformance was investigated using a logistic model. In a secondstep (model 2), age, sex, socioeconomic status, and education wereadded as covariates in the linear and logistic models described inmodel 1. In a third step (model 3), chronotype (with the interme-diate type as the reference category), sleep medication use, BMI as acontinuous variable, hypertension, antihypertensive medication,cardiovascular disease, depressive symptoms, and psychotropicmedication were added as further covariates. In afinal step (model4), sleep duration (with 7e9 h as the reference category) wasinserted as an additional predictor of cognitive performance. Wetherefore report unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted relation-ships between insomnia status and cognitive outcomes. For chro-notype, sleep duration and sleep medication, we report only thefully adjusted relationships (model 4) controlling for all de-mographic, clinical and remaining sleep variables.

Conversely, socioeconomic deprivation, Asian ethnic origin, current smoking, low alcohol intake, high body-mass index, high coffee consumption and being diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease or stroke were associated with a lower likelihood of PSA testing.

This type of cancer risk prediction is not yet available in the UK. We have adopted the approach used by the well-established U.S.-derived ""YourCancerRisk"" model for use in the UK population, which allow users to quantify their individual risk of developing individual cancers relative to the population average risk. The UK version of “YourCancerRisk"" computes 10-year cancer risk estimates for 11 cancers utilizing UK figures for prevalence of risk factors and cancer incidence.

These models provide a range of estimates of future risk of developing disease for applications in prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Most of them are disease specific. In general, risk algorithms include phenotypic information such as sex, age, and lifestyle factors. Some algorithms may also allow for the incorporation of emerging “omics”-based factors and other biomarkers (7).  Few cancer risk prediction models have included the modifiable risk components such as physical activity, diet, and smoking. One such model that has been developed for the United States is the ""YourCancerRisk"" model which has been used as a tool for education as well as providing an approach to quantifying the effects of changing key lifestyle exposures. This was subsequently expanded into ""YourDiseaseRisk"" (8), which extends the range of endpoints to include 12 of the commonest types of cancers in the United States and 6 other chronic diseases (e.g., chronic bronchitis, stroke, emphysema, heart disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis). The model was validated for ovarian, colon, and pancreatic cancers in the United States in Nurses’ Health Study and the U.S. Health Professionals cohorts. The results show the model to be well calibrated for ovarian and colon cancer in women and pancreatic cancer in men and moderately calibrated for colon cancer in men. Discriminatory accuracy for pancreatic cancer showed a concordance index of 0.72, and for colon cancer in men and women, concordance indices were 0.71 and 0.67, respectively (9).  The “YourDiseaseRisk” model aims to predict the risks for individuals (aged 40 and above) of developing the 12 cancers relative to the general population. Uniquely, the approach adopted to develop such models involved extensive systematic reviews of existing studies and finding a consensus of expert opinions to identify risk factors and to the summarize the level of evidence as “definite,” “probable,” and “possible” causes of cancer. Risk points were then allocated according to the strength of the causal association and summed. Population average risk of cancer and cumulative 10-year risk were obtained from the U.S. SEER data (10). Finally, individual ranking relative to the population average was determined.  The “YourDiseaseRisk” online tool has been available in the United States since 2000. It is offered as an educational tool, and in 2005, the site recorded 54 million hits with 6.2 million page views. It was first hosted at Harvard University and, in 2007, transitioned to the Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine (CITE Siteman/Wash U/BJH only; ref. 8).""",,No,,,,,"""The focus of this article is to describe the steps taken to adapt the ""YourDiseaseRisk"" models focused on cancers for the UK population for use in Primary Care and community-based settings.

The UKBiobank female cohort consists of 273,467 women with age ranged between 40 and 69 years when recruited. Participants were enrolled in the UK Biobank from April 2007 to July 2010, from 21 assessment centers across England, Wales, and Scotland using standardized procedures (11). The UK Biobank study was approved by the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided written informed consent to participate in the UK Biobank study. To date, the cohort has been followed up for 6 years. We computed RRs adjusted only for age. The results are presented in Table 6.  Model validation: An example To demonstrate model validation, we selected breast cancer risk prediction as an example. The UKBiobank cohort was used for the validation exercise. For breast cancer cases, we used ICD10, ICD9, and self-reported codes (verified by the UKBiobank health professionals), and only incident cases were included in the analysis. For controls, we used two comparison groups. Firstly only those subjects with no cancer code recorded in ICD10, ICD9 and secondly the coded with no cancer and no other self-reported illness. The total number of incident breast cancer cases was 3,378, and the total number of noncancer controls was 235,603 or healthy controls was 59,731. We coded all variables (except Tamoxifen/Raloxifene usage as such data were not available) present in the breast cancer risk prediction model based on the presence or absence of the exposure for each individual as illustrated in Table 3. To demonstrate model validation, we calculated the area under the curve of the model based on including all factors scored as a binary variable and generated calibration plots -the observed and expected proportions compare within the groups formed by the Hosmer–Lemeshow test. All analyses were performed using STATA 14 (12)...Once information on the UK prevalence of each risk factor was obtained, we then applied a score to each risk factor using the same scheme as presented in the original article (summary as shown in Table 3).  This risk score is used to compute two further scores—the population average risk score and an individual risk score relative to the population average. The population average score is calculated by multiplying the risk score of each factor by the population prevalence of that particular factor. To prevent negative scores, we chose the direction of each risk factor to make the population average score the highest possible. Taking physical activity, for example, the prevalence of carrying out 3 or more hours of total leisure-time physical activity per week in the UK population is 23%. This figure means that 77% of the population do not do physical activity regularly at this particular level. When we apply a prevalence of 77%, then the assigned score instead of being –10 (for those who are doing regular exercise) will be +10. This conversion allows us to demonstrate the change in the individual risk score following any change in factors that are modifiable. Summation of these scores produces the average population score.  The risk score for a given individual relative to the population average is based on the presence or absence of each factor. An example is illustrated in Table 4. The summation of scores for each risk factor for an individual provides the total risk score for a particular person. That total risk score is then divided by the average population score to give an individual index that is relative to population score (35/27= 1.3). As mentioned earlier, participants can see how their risk changes if they adopt suggested behaviors, for example, by choosing to do regular exercise, the total score for the individual illustrated in Table 4 can be reduced by 10 points (from 35 to 25), making their index score relative to the population reduced from 1.3 to 0.8. This calculation aims to illustrate to each individual the effect of a particular lifestyle or behavior change leading to cancer risk reduction.""",,NA,,,Not used,,NA,,,Not used,,No,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,NA,,,Not used,,,,,,,Partially,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,NA,,,,,Partially,,,"Missing potentially eligible ""The UKBiobank female cohort consists of 273,467 women...The total number of incident breast cancer cases was 3,378, and the total number of noncancer controls was 235,603 or healthy controls was 59,731.

Impaired cardiovascular function may cause cognitive decline by inhibiting cerebrovascular blood flow (called ‘neurovascular coupling’9) possibly leading to hypoperfusion and the amyloid beta plaques that characterize Alzheimer’s disease (AD).9,10 Some authors have suggested that the association may reflect reverse causation due to people with poorer cognitive function being less likely to adopt health-promoting lifestyles.2,11 While this may be the case, longitudinal data have also shown cardiometabolic diseases to be associated with subsequent decline in cognition over time.8 While it is established that individual cardiometabolic diseases are associated with non-demented cognitive ability,12 it is unknown whether there is an additive effect from having more than one disease.

While much of this progress has been attributed to enhanced pharmacotherapeutic and surgical approaches, there is some evidence that intensive approaches to modify cardiovascular behavioral risk factors (i.e. smoking cessation, physical activity, dietary intake) can also regress disease progression (Koton et al., 2014; Krumholz et al., 2014; Ornish, 1990). Despite this progress, 63% of worldwide deaths are still a result of obesity, diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesteremia; ideal levels of cardiovascular risk factors are achieved by less than 5% of the population; and low-income and underserved groups are disproportionately represented among those at greatest risk for poor cardiometabolic health and outcomes (Global Burden of Metabolic Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases Collaboration, 2014; Lloyd-Jones et al., 2014; Roger et al., 2012). Continuing and even accelerating declines in cardiometabolic disease morbidity and mortality may warrant consideration of a broader array of risk factors for cardiometabolic disease beyond the traditional triad of tobacco use, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet (Lloyd-Jones et al., 2014).  Sleep has been seen as a “non-traditional” risk factor for cardiometabolic disease (Chaput et al., 2010; Martinez-Gomez et al., 2013). Supporting this premise is evidence that cardiometabolic disease is more prevalent in short (=6 h) and long (=9 h) sleepers (Chaput et al., 2009, 2008; Grandner et al., 2014). Chronotype (preferred sleep–wake timing), or the extent to which an individual is a morning or an evening person (Di Milia et al., 2013; Zavada et al., 2005), is another sleep metric that has been associated with cardiometabolic risk behaviors and disease (Di Milia et al., 2013; Kanerva et al., 2012; Merikanto et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2015; Zavada et al., 2005). Extending sleep by an average of 35 to 45 min per night for 6 weeks in habitual short sleepers has led to improved insulin sensitivity and blood pressure (Haack et al., 2013; Leproult et al., 2015). While these studies do provide a signal for sleep as a viable target for improving cardiometabolic outcomes, the generalizability of this work is hampered by small sample sizes and stringent inclusion criteria that prevented the enrollment of participants with morning and evening chronotypes (Haack et al., 2013; Leproult et al., 2015). These limitations point to the need to elucidate the relationship between sleep duration and chronotype with cardiometabolic outcomes at the population level.  Relevant to the consideration of sleep as a possible target for cardiometabolic disease are data showing that demographic and socioeconomic status confounds the relationship between sleep duration and cardiometabolic health (Krueger & Friedman, 2009). Disparities in cardiometabolic health have been widely reported. Black ethnicity, lower income and lower educational attainment have been consistently associated with poorer cardiometabolic outcomes and short sleep at the population level (Patel et al., 2010; Roger et al., 2012). Demographic variation in chronotype (variation in sleep–wake timing) is less well elucidated. Given that chronotype can be modified by environmental factors such as light exposure, this sleep metric has the potential to be a target for efforts to improve cardiometabolic health (Wright et al., 2013).  National sleep goals have called for a greater understanding of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in sleep, as well as the exploration of chronobiological factors, such as chronotype, related to physical health across age groups and among diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups (US Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Health, & National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, 2011; Zee et al., 2014). The lines of evidence presented here suggest that sleep duration, and to a lesser extent, chronotype may be viable targets for approaches to improve cardiometabolic health outcomes. However, this literature is hampered by small sample sizes and limited representation of morning and evening chronotypes. In response to the national sleep goals and to address the limited generalizability of studies to date, the current study examines associations between sociodemographic characteristics and cardiometabolic diseases across sleep duration and morning–evening categories in a large population sample of adults (N = 439 933). Results from this analysis are expected to clarify and identify the associations between sleep duration and chronotype with sociodemographic and cardiometabolic outcomes at the population level and in doing so, present hypotheses for how sleep can be recognized as a multidimensional behavior from which targeted approaches to improving cardiometabolic health can be developed.""","""Advances in the treatment of cardiometabolic disease have led to steady declines in both incidence and morbidity from stroke and myocardial infarction since the 1980s (Koton et al., 2014; Krumholz et al., 2014).

It is possible that our criteria for mood disorder are less stringent than formal diagnostic criteria. It should be noted, however, that we are reporting features of mood disorders at a population level, rather than formal clinical diagnoses, and we were unable to validate diagnoses because of the lack of availability of definitive diagnostic information.

There is, however, evidence for the validity of these groupings using internal variables, 19 for example, the gender distributions of approximately 1:1 for bipolar disorder and approximately 2:1 (women:men) for depression are consistent with a large body of epidemiological research on lifetime rates of mood disorder in men and women. 20,21 Furthermore, the lifetime prevalence rates for bipolar disorder (1.1%) and recurrent major depressive disorder (21.2%) are consistent with other population-based lifetime estimates. 15  Although we are reasonably confident that members of the control groups did not have significant features of depression or bipolar disorder, it should be noted that a proportion may have fulfilled criteria for other mental illnesses, such as anxiety disorder or, less likely, schizophrenia, both of which have been associated with poor cardiometabolic health. 19,22,23 There are also limitations with our broad definition of current psychotropic medication use that groups together different classes of medication.

It is therefore possible that adverse cardiovascular outcomes in depressive disorders are not limited to the use of antipsychotics but may also be a consequence of other classes of psychotropic medications.  A relatively low proportion of the mood disorder features groups reported taking psychotropic medication (bipolar features 32.1%, depressive features 20.6% and controls 3.4%) but, as noted above, the focus in this study was not clinically diagnosed mood disordered groups but rather lifetime features of mood disorder at a population level.

Support for this hypothesis was provided by the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study which found that larger waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio were associated with a greater risk of developing colon cancer among non-HRT users only, with no relationship observed for HRT users4. However, inconsistent findings have been reported in other studies which have investigated whether HRT use modified the relationship between obesity and colorectal cancer5,6. Additional studies with large numbers of incident cases are required to investigate how adiposity relates to colorectal cancer risk among users and non-users of HRT.

Associations with hospitalisation for angina in men were similar in age-adjusted models [HR1.54; 95%CI: 1.03, 2.30), p = 0.037], but did not remain statistical significant after full adjustment [HR 1.64; 95%CI: 0.88, 3.07); p = 0.121]. HRs for admission with angina were lower in women, and neither age- nor fully adjusted relationships attained statistical significance.

Several studies have documented associations between chronic inflammation, osteoporosis [12, 13] and cardiovascular disease [14], together with other conditions such as sarcopenia [15], diabetes/obesity [16] and dementia [17], suggesting one possible common mechanism.

We explored associations between previous fracture/fragility fracture and (i) hospital admission for ischaemic heart disease, (ii) hospital admission for acute myocardial infarction or (iii) hospital admission for angina, using Cox proportional hazards models, with results expressed as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). In further analyses, we explored the associations between previous fragility fracture and hospital admission for either ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction or angina using competing-risk regression models, with death from any cause as competing risk event. We used a similar approach to investigate associations between previous fragility fracture and risk of death due to ischaemic heart disease, accounting for risk of death from any other cause. Competing hazard models generate sub-hazard ratios (SHRs) instead of hazard ratios and treat death from any cause as competing risk as participants who experience this event cannot have a subsequent outcome, unlike those who are lost at follow-up (censored). The interpretation of SHR is similar to the HR of a Cox regression, with estimates higher than 1 indicating an increased risk of the outcome controlling for the fact that the competing risk events can also occur.

Introduction Musculoskeletal pain is a major public health burden worldwide. It is common in western countries with a prevalence estimated as high as 74% in the general population,1 leading to restrictions in physical function and mobility impairments including decreased balance and gait speed, reduced quality of life and disability.2, 3 Chronic musculoskeletal pain, generally defined as persistent or recurrent pain lasting more than three months, is typically represented by conditions such as low back pain, neck pain, chronic widespread pain (fibromyalgia) and osteoarthritis.4, 5 A recent study of the global burden of the 328 diseases and injuries reported that low back pain, neck pain, other musculoskeletal disorders and osteoarthritis were ranked 1st, 6th, 7th and 12th, respectively, for years lived with disability (YLDs).6 Multiple risk factors have been reported to be associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain.4, 5, 7 There is a difference in pain mechanisms underlying acute and chronic pain. In addition to peripheral tissue injury, evidence is growing that central nervous system factor is of prominent importance in the development and persistence of chronic pain.9  In pain research, the concept of ‘multi-site’ or ‘multiple site’ pain (MSP) has been proposed; defined as musculoskeletal pain occurring at more than one site, although, currently, an exact definition is still unclear. The prevalence of MSP is approximately 41–75% depending on study population and number of painful sites measured.10 MSP has been found to be associated with poorer physical and psychological health, worse health-related quality of life, and more severe depressive symptoms as compared to single-site musculoskeletal pain in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.11, 12 In addition, several studies reported the adverse effects of MSP on other health outcomes, including risk of falls,13 cognitive impairments14 and sleep quality.15 There is also evidence to support more pronounced associations with these outcomes as painful sites increase. Many of these outcomes may result from and lead to reduced physical activity (PA).16, 18, 19  Low PA is the fourth leading cause of mortality worldwide. Lack of PA is associated with an increased risk for cardio-metabolic disorders20 such as diabetes and heart diseases; and common mental disorders,21 such as depression and anxiety. A recent meta-analysis of eight studies found that older people with musculoskeletal pain are less likely to engage in PA than those without musculoskeletal pain.22 All included studies have relied on a self-reported PA from which it is hard to quantify total PA across different domains. Self-reported activity levels are however poorly correlated with objective measures of PA participation, i.e. accelerometer, with self-reported PA estimates more likely to be higher than those measured by objectively measured PA.23 This highlights the need for accurate and reliable measurements of PA in assessing the relationship between PA and health outcomes.  Pain experience is a complex and multifactorial nature with multiple domains involved including peripheral, psychological and neurological.24 This heterogeneity leads to the variation in individual pain perception (including pain intensity, frequency and pattern).25 PA offers a broad range of health benefits; however, the mechanisms by which exercise exerts its effects remain unclear. There is evidence from mechanistically-orientated studies of PA and pain relief to support a variety mechanisms, including changes in both the peripheral and central components of the nervous systems,26, 27, 28 reduced level of chronic inflammation/comorbidities,29, 30, 31 muscle strengthening and aerobic capacity32, 33 and improvements in psychological and cognitive function.32, 34 Whilst the causal direction of PA and pain is hard to discern, awareness is increasing that chronic pain is associated with brain structural change,35 psychosocial issues (e.g. fear-avoidance beliefs and behaviours, fear of falling32 and cognitive impairment36), which in turn contribute to reduced PA.""","""Musculoskeletal pain is a major public health burden worldwide. It is common in western countries with a prevalence estimated as high as 74% in the general population,1 leading to restrictions in physical function and mobility impairments including decreased balance and gait speed, reduced quality of life and disability.2, 3 Chronic musculoskeletal pain, generally defined as persistent or recurrent pain lasting more than three months, is typically represented by conditions such as low back pain, neck pain, chronic widespread pain (fibromyalgia) and osteoarthritis.4, 5 A recent study of the global burden of the 328 diseases and injuries reported that low back pain, neck pain, other musculoskeletal disorders and osteoarthritis were ranked 1st, 6th, 7th and 12th, respectively, for years lived with disability (YLDs).6 Multiple risk factors have been reported to be associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain.4, 5, 7 There is a difference in pain mechanisms underlying acute and chronic pain. In addition to peripheral tissue injury, evidence is growing that central nervous system factor is of prominent importance in the development and persistence of chronic pain.9""",Yes,Yes,,"""To our knowledge, there are no previous studies reporting on the relationship between pain at multiple sites and objectively measured physical work capacity (PWC) and PA.""","""To our knowledge, there are no previous studies reporting on the relationship between pain at multiple sites and objectively measured physical work capacity (PWC) and PA.""",""".

Participants were asked to wear the accelerometer on their dominant wrist continuously while engaging in their normal daily activities, and then return the device. This study used the accelerometry scores which were calculated from the raw accelerometer data with a rigorous data processing procedure, published elsewhere.40 This considered both the time and intensity of PA to maintain the average vector magnitude value over five seconds epochs, thereby providing a summary score representing an average PA level over a given time period. 103,578 participants were included in wear time analysis.

The participant’s risk category was first calculated to determine what level of activity they should perform or have only a resting ECG performed. There were five risk categories: Category 2 consisted of participants who had a heart condition or diastolic blood pressure =95 mm of Hg and systolic blood pressure =160 mm of Hg; Category 3 had participants who had chest pain during physical activity or missing data on height/heart rate; Category 4 consisted of participants who had chest pain at rest, who were unable to walk/cycle unaided for ten minutes, were pregnant, who had no data on weight, blood pressure, or pacemaker status, had diastolic blood pressure =110 mm of Hg and systolic blood pressure =180 mm of Hg, or weighed =150 kg; Category 5 comprised participants who had a pacemaker; Category 1 consisted of participants who did not belong to any of the above categories.

This emphasises that developing effective management and treatments for people with chronic pain are of particular importance to promote PA engagement.  Practical implications • People with a greater number of musculoskeletal painful sites are less active and have poorer physical fitness than those with fewer painful sites.  • Interventions targeting chronic musculoskeletal pain may have profound effects on increased levels of PA.  • Given the bidirectional relationship between chronic pain and PA, clinician should address the critical role of being physically active in managing chronic musculoskeletal pain.""","""Musculoskeletal pain at multiple sites is consistently associated with poorer PWC, increased low intensity PA and reduced moderate to vigorous PA.

These include more stringent exclusion of prevalent conditions, and incident cases occurring in the first 2 years; adjustment for a more comprehensive set of potential individual level confounders and other covariates, ranging from markers of socioeconomic position to behavioural characteristics (sleep, diet and other physical activity) and mostly self-reported health conditions; and consideration of non-commuting travel as an important exposure alongside the more frequently researched activity of commuting. In general, the progressive adjustment indicated that the magnitude of the associations were very similar (even if some results became non-significant). In combination, these approaches are likely to have reduced but not eliminated the risks of reverse causation, residual confounding and a healthy worker effect, any of which might lead to an overestimation of the true effects. UK Biobank participants are less ethnically diverse and healthier than the general UK population,14 and a substantial number gave insufficient information on key variables for them to be included in analysis. Participants who were excluded from the analysis also tended to report lower levels of physical activity, lower occupational classification and lower educational attainment than those who were included. While this admittedly limits the generalisability of some of our descriptive statistics to the national population, there is no particular reason to believe that our results are not generalisable in principle. Our analyses assume that travel patterns remain relatively stable over follow-up. We did not have information about changes in activity from the entire cohort, but repeated measures in less than 2% of our sample 4 years after baseline indicated that patterns of commuting remained very stable for the majority.16""","""Implications for policy and practice Taken together and in the light of existing evidence, our findings provide further support for a hypothesis that more active patterns of travel for both commuting and non-commuting purposes may be associated with significant reductions in CVD and all-cause mortality. This is an important message for clinicians advising people about how to be physically active and reduce their risk of disease. We also found no evidence that these associations were moderated by car access, which could be explained by the heterogenous nature of the group who did not rely on car use, but it may also suggest that the benefits are available to all, irrespective of car access or distance to work.  Demographic and technological trends in countries such as the UK are thought likely to result in a reduced requirement for commuting over time and a dispersal of older people towards more rural areas,11 both of which will increase the importance of non-commuting travel. Interventions that encourage people to reduce their car use in favour of making more use of public transport, walking, cycling, or combinations thereof, may be more widely applicable than efforts to promote walking or cycling in particular, especially among people whose circumstances preclude, for example, cycling all the way to work, or giving up the car completely in a rural area. Our own previous research has highlighted the potential health gains associated with integrating walking or cycling stages into longer journeys by car or public transport,9 a target for public health intervention also supported by recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence,27 the UN and the WHO.28  Implications for future research Longer term or more rigorous longitudinal analysis could investigate in more detail the extent to which changes in travel behaviour result in individual health benefits. Cohorts such as UK Biobank provide the opportunity to follow-up large numbers of people at regular intervals (not just at baseline) over a longer period of time, and the accrual of more cases of disease over time will increase the power to detect associations that may not have become apparent to date. Collecting more detailed information about the frequency, duration and modal composition of trips, whether in this cohort or other future studies, would enable more definitive investigation of these associations and the extent to which they are modified by car access, distance or other factors.""","""Longer term or more rigorous longitudinal analysis could investigate in more detail the extent to which changes in travel behaviour result in individual health benefits.

These include total body or appendicular muscle mass adjusted for height only,7, 8, 11 height and fat mass,9 or body size [i.e. body mass index (BMI)13 or body mass12].

The main limitation was that clinical psychiatric diagnoses were available for a smaller subset.

Future research will need to replicate our results with samples from other age groups to determine generalisability across the lifespan.

No strong or statistically significant evidence of time dependence emerged for all-cause mortality among lifelong non-smokers. Nevertheless, results for all-cause mortality were partitioned at 5 years of follow-up for two reasons. First, because the minimum duration of follow-up in UKB was 4.87 years, so virtually all of that cohort had been followed for 5 years or more, allowing a more direct comparison with results from the national health surveys, all of which had been followed for more than 5 years. The second reason for partitioning at 5 years was to address the possibility of reverse causation (impaired spirometric performance due to pre-existing conditions which lead to early death).

Socioeconomic status was measured at the level of residential area, using the Townsend Deprivation Index, grouped into quartiles for analysis. Biobank recruitment centre was used as an additional covariate to adjust for possible regional differences.  Adjustment of spirometric measures for gender, age and height The Global Lung Initiative (GLI) 2012 reference equations for white ethnic groups18 were used in both sets of data to standardise FEV1 and FVC for age, sex and height. The GLI-2012 equations generate a ‘z-score’ which represents the relative position of an individual among the distribution predicted for lifelong non-smokers with no history of lung disease of the same gender, age and height. This allows for the spread of predicted values to differ by age, height and gender, expressing the relative ranking of an individual in terms of a SD (z) score. For each individual in the analysis, there were three GLI-2012 z-scores, corresponding to their relative ranking for FEV1 (zFEV1), FVC (zFVC) and the ratio FEV1:FVC (zFEVFVC). Outlying observations were excluded by restricting all the analyses in both data sets to values of zFEV1 and zFVC within the range -5 to +5 z-score units. This exclusion removed 0.2% of UKB participants, 0.5% of participants in the national health surveys aged 40–69 years and 0.3% of national health survey participants aged 70 years or more.  Modelling of mortality The relationship of spirometric indices with subsequent mortality was modelled by proportional hazards (Cox) regression, which estimates the relative increase in mortality rate (HR) for a unit change in each explanatory variable. The z-scores are expressed on a SD scale, so HRs for zFEV1 and zFVC are expressed per unit decrement (ie, an increase in risk for a decrease in lung function). A typical range of z-scores among lifelong non-smokers would be 4 units. A HR of 1.2 per unit decrement corresponds approximately to a twofold difference in mortality rate across this range.  Due to the high correlation between zFEV1 and zFVC among lifelong non-smokers (0.88 in Biobank, 0.80 in national health survey participants aged 40–69 years), we modelled the association of mortality with zFEV1 both alone and jointly with zFEVFVC, and similarly for zFVC. Among never-smokers, the correlations between zFEV1 and zFEVFVC (0.35 in Biobank, 0.36 in the national surveys) and between zFVC and zFEVFVC (-0.13 in Biobank, -0.20 in the national surveys) were weak enough to avoid major collinearity in the joint models. The significance of the HR for zFEVFVC when modelled jointly with zFEV1 was used to assess whether zFVC predicted mortality independent of zFEV1, and vice versa when zFEVFVC was modelled jointly with zFEV1.  All proportional hazards models were restricted to white participants and adjusted for sex, age, standing height, socioeconomic status and region. Analyses of data from the five national health surveys were additionally adjusted for survey year as a categorical variable. Since each survey was conducted in a different year, inclusion of survey year in the model is closely equivalent to a fixed-effect meta-analysis of the results from each of the five surveys. In a more formal two-stage individual participant meta-analysis for all-cause mortality in lifelong non-smokers, there was no substantial or significant heterogeneity of HRs among the five national health surveys (I²=0.0%, p=0.775 for zFEV1; I²=10.5%, p=0.346 for zFVC). Therefore, for simplicity of presentation we report results for the five national surveys combined, but analyse UKB separately because one of our objectives is to investigate how closely these two sets of results correspond. Heterogeneity between HRs for the pooled national surveys and UKB was assessed by testing the significance of the difference between the corresponding log-HRs from these two data sets.  The assumption of proportionality of hazards was assessed by log-log plots and by fitting zFEV1 or zFVC as a time-dependent covariate in the model. No strong or statistically significant evidence of time dependence emerged for all-cause mortality among lifelong non-smokers. Nevertheless, results for all-cause mortality were partitioned at 5 years of follow-up for two reasons. First, because the minimum duration of follow-up in UKB was 4.87 years, so virtually all of that cohort had been followed for 5 years or more, allowing a more direct comparison with results from the national health surveys, all of which had been followed for more than 5 years. The second reason for partitioning at 5 years was to address the possibility of reverse causation (impaired spirometric performance due to pre-existing conditions which lead to early death).

This was considered the most inclusive sample of ‘usable spirograms’. When end-blow quality was also considered, 58% of the cohort had evidence of a good plateau and both FEV1 and FVC reproducible within 150 mL, the criteria recommended by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) Task Force on Standardisation of Spirometry.17 This subgroup of 58% was considered to be the ‘best quality’ spirograms, among which to evaluate the relative importance of FEV1 and FVC as predictors of mortality.  The present analysis is based on deaths occurring up to mid-August 2015, a mean follow-up period of 6.5 years. There were 2401 deaths among 149 343 lifelong non-smokers aged 40–69 years of white ethnicity who performed ‘usable spirograms. Deaths from respiratory disease, circulatory disease, cancer and all other causes were coded using ICD10 (chapters J, I, C and all others, respectively).  Smoking history was self reported. Socioeconomic status was measured at the level of residential area, using the Townsend Deprivation Index, grouped into quartiles for analysis. Biobank recruitment centre was used as an additional covariate to adjust for possible regional differences.  Adjustment of spirometric measures for gender, age and height The Global Lung Initiative (GLI) 2012 reference equations for white ethnic groups18 were used in both sets of data to standardise FEV1 and FVC for age, sex and height. The GLI-2012 equations generate a ‘z-score’ which represents the relative position of an individual among the distribution predicted for lifelong non-smokers with no history of lung disease of the same gender, age and height. This allows for the spread of predicted values to differ by age, height and gender, expressing the relative ranking of an individual in terms of a SD (z) score. For each individual in the analysis, there were three GLI-2012 z-scores, corresponding to their relative ranking for FEV1 (zFEV1), FVC (zFVC) and the ratio FEV1:FVC (zFEVFVC). Outlying observations were excluded by restricting all the analyses in both data sets to values of zFEV1 and zFVC within the range -5 to +5 z-score units. This exclusion removed 0.2% of UKB participants, 0.5% of participants in the national health surveys aged 40–69 years and 0.3% of national health survey participants aged 70 years or more.  Modelling of mortality The relationship of spirometric indices with subsequent mortality was modelled by proportional hazards (Cox) regression, which estimates the relative increase in mortality rate (HR) for a unit change in each explanatory variable. The z-scores are expressed on a SD scale, so HRs for zFEV1 and zFVC are expressed per unit decrement (ie, an increase in risk for a decrease in lung function). A typical range of z-scores among lifelong non-smokers would be 4 units. A HR of 1.2 per unit decrement corresponds approximately to a twofold difference in mortality rate across this range.  Due to the high correlation between zFEV1 and zFVC among lifelong non-smokers (0.88 in Biobank, 0.80 in national health survey participants aged 40–69 years), we modelled the association of mortality with zFEV1 both alone and jointly with zFEVFVC, and similarly for zFVC. Among never-smokers, the correlations between zFEV1 and zFEVFVC (0.35 in Biobank, 0.36 in the national surveys) and between zFVC and zFEVFVC (-0.13 in Biobank, -0.20 in the national surveys) were weak enough to avoid major collinearity in the joint models. The significance of the HR for zFEVFVC when modelled jointly with zFEV1 was used to assess whether zFVC predicted mortality independent of zFEV1, and vice versa when zFEVFVC was modelled jointly with zFEV1.  All proportional hazards models were restricted to white participants and adjusted for sex, age, standing height, socioeconomic status and region. Analyses of data from the five national health surveys were additionally adjusted for survey year as a categorical variable. Since each survey was conducted in a different year, inclusion of survey year in the model is closely equivalent to a fixed-effect meta-analysis of the results from each of the five surveys. In a more formal two-stage individual participant meta-analysis for all-cause mortality in lifelong non-smokers, there was no substantial or significant heterogeneity of HRs among the five national health surveys (I²=0.0%, p=0.775 for zFEV1; I²=10.5%, p=0.346 for zFVC). Therefore, for simplicity of presentation we report results for the five national surveys combined, but analyse UKB separately because one of our objectives is to investigate how closely these two sets of results correspond. Heterogeneity between HRs for the pooled national surveys and UKB was assessed by testing the significance of the difference between the corresponding log-HRs from these two data sets.  The assumption of proportionality of hazards was assessed by log-log plots and by fitting zFEV1 or zFVC as a time-dependent covariate in the model. No strong or statistically significant evidence of time dependence emerged for all-cause mortality among lifelong non-smokers. Nevertheless, results for all-cause mortality were partitioned at 5 years of follow-up for two reasons. First, because the minimum duration of follow-up in UKB was 4.87 years, so virtually all of that cohort had been followed for 5 years or more, allowing a more direct comparison with results from the national health surveys, all of which had been followed for more than 5 years. The second reason for partitioning at 5 years was to address the possibility of reverse causation (impaired spirometric performance due to pre-existing conditions which lead to early death). Reverse causation was also investigated by analysing mortality in subgroups with no prior history of respiratory disease, circulatory disease or cancer.""",no catagories,NA,No,No,Not used,,Yes,Yes,,"Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, e-Table 3,  e-Table 4, e-Table 6, e-Table 7, Figure 1","""Online supplementary e-table 3 shows that within UKB the general pattern of results was similar in both sexes.

Estimates of prevalence rates vary from 4.7 % [3] to 24 % [4] depending on study design and case definition [2]. Chronic widespread pain became conceptualised in 1990, for the first time within the case definition of a disease, by the American College of Rheumatologists when they defined it as pain that is bilateral, above and below the waist and in the axial skeleton, for more than 3 months. In the presence of an elevated number (11 of 18) of ‘tender points’, as evidence of allodynia, these became the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia syndrome [5]. Chronic widespread pain, using this and other definitions [3], has been much studied, and the importance of chronic widespread pain to individuals, health care providers and society as a whole has become widely recognised. It is associated not only with high levels of morbidity but also with increased rates of mortality, attributable mostly to excess cardiovascular disease and cancer [6–8].  A wide variety of exposures have been identified as risk factors for chronic widespread pain, relating not only to social and psychological factors but also to physical insults such as acute ‘whiplash’ injury in road traffic accidents [2]. However, it is unclear whether the occurrence of a bony fracture, a common clinical event causing acute stress with tissue damage, predisposes to an increased risk of chronic widespread pain. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to determine whether fractures were associated with chronic widespread pain, using data from the UK Biobank cohort.""","""Chronic widespread pain is common and associated with distress, disability and substantial direct and indirect health care costs [1, 2].

Chronic widespread pain, using this and other definitions [3], has been much studied, and the importance of chronic widespread pain to individuals, health care providers and society as a whole has become widely recognised. It is associated not only with high levels of morbidity but also with increased rates of mortality, attributable mostly to excess cardiovascular disease and cancer [6–8].""",Yes,Yes,,"""A wide variety of exposures have been identified as risk factors for chronic widespread pain, relating not only to social and psychological factors but also to physical insults such as acute ‘whiplash’ injury in road traffic accidents [2]. However, it is unclear whether the occurrence of a bony fracture, a common clinical event causing acute stress with tissue damage, predisposes to an increased risk of chronic widespread pain. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to determine whether fractures were associated with chronic widespread pain, using data from the UK Biobank cohort.""","""A wide variety of exposures have been identified as risk factors for chronic widespread pain, relating not only to social and psychological factors but also to physical insults such as acute ‘whiplash’ injury in road traffic accidents [2].

Sedentary behavior (i.e., awake time sitting/reclining with low energy expenditure [31]) is increasingly recognized as an additional risk factor for chronic disease (39). TV viewing in particular has been most strongly and consistently associated with incident diabetes, cardiovascular disease, specific cancers, and premature mortality from a multitude of causes in adults, irrespective of levels of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) (10,20,21,29,38). Consequently, separate public health guidelines focusing on TV viewing in adults have been advocated (20,35,38). Early intervention work focusing on recreational sedentary screen time has shown promising results (27). Nevertheless, at a population level, this behavior still amounts to a substantial proportion of people's time. English adults, for example, on average watch TV for 3 h·d-1, making it the single most prevalent leisure time pursuit (similar to the US [8]), and although total sedentary time has shown a slight decrease in recent years, TV viewing has not declined (30). This high prevalence together with reasonably strong associations with premature mortality has resulted in sizeable estimates of public health effect (14,21,35,38).  Recommendations on reducing screen time should involve replacement by nonsitting rather than other sitting activities. The most feasible behavioral change options likely involve replacement of screen time by nonsitting activities in the home and leisure time domain (i.e., discretionary time) rather than by nonsitting activities at work or during transportation (i.e., nondiscretionary time). It is however largely unknown which types of such discretionary activities would be healthy alternatives. This is partially because current estimates for mortality risk have only considered the potential additive effect of screen time reductions per se, i.e., while keeping all other activities constant. Total discretionary time is however fairly constant in this age-group and mortality risk reductions from decreasing screen time depend on the activity that displaces screen time (25). Higher-intensity physical activities are associated with greater longevity but are generally less amenable to change (19,28). Activities that can be easily incorporated into daily life (e.g., home maintenance and improvement activities) are perceived as more attractive compared with activities which require more organization and costs (e.g., sports) (19).  Isotemporal substitution modeling allows the estimation of the mortality benefits of replacing screen time with another specific type of activity for the same duration, while keeping other activities constant (25). This approach, therefore, provides a more realistic insight into the potential effect of behavioral change using observational data (39), which is of interest given the lack of intervention studies with mortality as an outcome. We therefore aimed to estimate the differential mortality risk reductions associated with substituting leisure screen time with different discretionary physical activity types, in a large sample of UK middle-age adults, by means of isotemporal substitution modeling. To further inform public health guidance, we also estimated the proportional reduction in all-cause mortality incidence associated with each of these behavioral change scenarios.""","""Physical activity is well-established as a lifestyle component contributing to longevity (22).

When examining the two screen time variables separately, associations for TV viewing time were the strongest, showing a 2% higher mortality hazard for each 30 min·d-1 difference, whereas associations for computer use were nonsignificant. A significant interaction between computer use and sex was identified (P = 0.001). Examining the independent associations with all-cause mortality for computer use separately by sex, there was a positive association (1.015, 1.001–1.031) in women, whereas the association was negative (0.986, 0.975–0.996) in men. Therefore, isotemporal substitution for computer use was modeled in men and women separately.  Isotemporal substitution models As shown in Figure 1, each 30-min·d-1 difference in screen time was associated with a lower mortality hazard when modeling substitution of screen time by an equal amount of daily life activities as well as by an equal amount of structured exercise. Although modeling 30-min·d-1 replacements of screen time by structured exercise resulted in the lowest mortality hazard (0.87, 0.84–0.90), modeling substitution by daily life activities also suggested a relevant protective effect (0.95, 0.94–0.97). When looking at more specific subtypes of daily life activities, the lowest mortality hazards were found when modeling 30 min·d-1 reallocations from screen time into walking for pleasure (0.95, 0.92–0.98) and into heavy DIY (0.93, 0.90–0.96), whereas potential mortality benefits were more limited when modeling reallocation into light DIY (0.97, 0.94–1.00). However, CI did overlap between estimates for these activity subtypes. As expected, the modeled effects of replacing 30 min of screen time with an equivalent duration of strenuous sports (0.87, 0.79–0.95) and other types of exercise (0.88, 0.84–0.91) were stronger.  Results when modeling substitution of TV viewing time were similar to those when modeling substitution of screen time (Fig. 1). The modeled effects of substitution of computer time by different activity types were less consistent, with generally weaker effect estimates than for screen and TV viewing time. In both men and women, a potential protective effect was found when modeling substitution of computer time by daily life activities (men, 0.98, 0.96–1.00; women, 0.94, 0.91–0.97) and structured exercise (men, 0.89, 0.85–0.93; women, 0.90, 0.84–0.96). For daily life activities in women, this was mainly driven by walking for pleasure (0.93, 0.89–0.98) and heavy DIY (0.84, 0.76–0.94). Modeling reallocation of computer time into other exercises showed a potential protective effect in men (0.88, 0.84–0.93) and women (0.90, 0.84–0.97), whereas results for reallocation into strenuous sports only reached significance in men (0.90, 0.81–0.99).... PIF Figure 2 displays PIFs for time reallocation of overall screen and TV viewing time (i.e., the sedentary behaviors that consistently showed associations with mortality) into the different discretionary activity types. For example, if UK Biobank participants were to decrease their screen time by an average of 30 min·d-1 in exchange for a daily 30-min walk, the incidence of all-cause mortality would decrease by 5.9%, assuming causality. The estimated PIFs were highest when replacing TV viewing time by either strenuous sports or other exercises (14.9% and 14.6%, respectively) and lowest when replacing screen time with light DIY (4.3%).""",Figure 1,Yes,Yes,,"""Partition models As shown in Table 3, each 30-min·d-1 difference in screen time was associated with a 1% higher hazard of all-cause mortality, independent of time spent in activity and all other confounding variables included in the model.

Although modeling 30-min·d-1 replacements of screen time by structured exercise resulted in the lowest mortality hazard (0.87, 0.84–0.90), modeling substitution by daily life activities also suggested a relevant protective effect (0.95, 0.94–0.97). When looking at more specific subtypes of daily life activities, the lowest mortality hazards were found when modeling 30 min·d-1 reallocations from screen time into walking for pleasure (0.95, 0.92–0.98) and into heavy DIY (0.93, 0.90–0.96), whereas potential mortality benefits were more limited when modeling reallocation into light DIY (0.97, 0.94–1.00). However, CI did overlap between estimates for these activity subtypes. As expected, the modeled effects of replacing 30 min of screen time with an equivalent duration of strenuous sports (0.87, 0.79–0.95) and other types of exercise (0.88, 0.84–0.91) were stronger.  Results when modeling substitution of TV viewing time were similar to those when modeling substitution of screen time (Fig. 1). The modeled effects of substitution of computer time by different activity types were less consistent, with generally weaker effect estimates than for screen and TV viewing time. In both men and women, a potential protective effect was found when modeling substitution of computer time by daily life activities (men, 0.98, 0.96–1.00; women, 0.94, 0.91–0.97) and structured exercise (men, 0.89, 0.85–0.93; women, 0.90, 0.84–0.96). For daily life activities in women, this was mainly driven by walking for pleasure (0.93, 0.89–0.98) and heavy DIY (0.84, 0.76–0.94). Modeling reallocation of computer time into other exercises showed a potential protective effect in men (0.88, 0.84–0.93) and women (0.90, 0.84–0.97), whereas results for reallocation into strenuous sports only reached significance in men (0.90, 0.81–0.99).... PIF Figure 2 displays PIFs for time reallocation of overall screen and TV viewing time (i.e., the sedentary behaviors that consistently showed associations with mortality) into the different discretionary activity types. For example, if UK Biobank participants were to decrease their screen time by an average of 30 min·d-1 in exchange for a daily 30-min walk, the incidence of all-cause mortality would decrease by 5.9%, assuming causality. The estimated PIFs were highest when replacing TV viewing time by either strenuous sports or other exercises (14.9% and 14.6%, respectively) and lowest when replacing screen time with light DIY (4.3%).""",Figure 1,Yes,Yes,,"""Partition models As shown in Table 3, each 30-min·d-1 difference in screen time was associated with a 1% higher hazard of all-cause mortality, independent of time spent in activity and all other confounding variables included in the model. Furthermore, each 30-min·d-1 difference in daily life activities and in structured exercise was independently associated with a 4% and 12% lower hazard for all-cause mortality. When examining the two screen time variables separately, associations for TV viewing time were the strongest, showing a 2% higher mortality hazard for each 30 min·d-1 difference, whereas associations for computer use were nonsignificant. A significant interaction between computer use and sex was identified (P = 0.001). Examining the independent associations with all-cause mortality for computer use separately by sex, there was a positive association (1.015, 1.001–1.031) in women, whereas the association was negative (0.986, 0.975–0.996) in men.

The direction and strength of the associations from partition models found for screen time (32) and TV viewing time (14) confirm those found previously, as well as the stronger and more consistent associations for TV viewing compared with computer time (2,4,26). Previous meta-analytical work has also indicated protective mortality effects for exercise/sports as well as daily life activities, with stronger effect estimates for the former (28). However, none of these studies examined the substitutional effects between screen time and these different discretionary activity types. Indeed, the few studies that have used an isotemporal substitution approach in relation to mortality have focused on non-domain-specific sedentary time and/or non-domain-specific physical activity (11,23,33). We chose to specifically focus on leisure-screen time, given its high prevalence across all age-groups, stronger associations with health compared with other sedentary behaviors, and responsiveness to change through intervention [8,20,21,27,29,30,35,38]. We specifically focused on discretionary activity types in the leisure and home domain, as these are likely more realistic and feasible alternatives for replacing leisure screen time in a middle-age population compared with activities in the occupational and transportation domain.  Our findings suggested that both replacement by lower (i.e., walking for pleasure and light DIY) and higher-intensity activities (i.e., heavy DIY, strenuous sports, and other exercise) was found to be beneficial; however, the latter conferred the largest benefit""","""The findings of this study provide novel insights into the potential beneficial effects on mortality risk of substituting recreational screen-time by different types of discretionary active alternatives in a large population-based sample of UK middle-aged adults.

Suggested mechanisms explaining these associations include changes in bioavailable estrogen (increase in 16a-hydroxyestrone, 16-epiestriol, and 2-catechols and decrease in total and free estradiol levels and parent estrogens to metabolites ratio), antioxidative properties of coffee constituents (polyphenol antioxidants), and changes in DNA methylation and cellular differentiation [5,6,7,8,9,10]. Coffee is also the main source of dietary caffeine which has demonstrated conflicting findings with respect to breast cancer risk in previous studies [11]. A recent meta-analysis suggested a weak association of coffee and caffeine intake with breast cancer risk for postmenopausal women [12]. Enzymes involved in metabolism of caffeine are involved in estrogen metabolism and circulating estrogens are known to increase the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer [13,14,15,16].

However, mechanisms supporting these associations have not been well elucidated and confounding or reverse causality remains a possibility. One suggested hypothesis is that higher intelligence might reflect greater ‘system integrity’ resulting in an organism that can respond more robustly to environmental stressors (Deary, 2008). This hypothesis has been explored in several small studies through the use of reaction time, which is as a measure of the brain's information processing efficiency whilst also acting as a wider marker of cognitive function and whole body systems integrity (Batterham et al., 2014, Deary, 2012, Deary and Der, 2005, Hagger-Johnson et al., 2014, Nissan et al., 2013, Roberts et al., 2009, Shipley et al., 2006). For example, a small epidemiological study (n = 898) found that the association between intelligence and mortality was attenuated after adjusting for reaction time, whilst another investigation found that the association between brain white matter integrity and general intelligence was mediated through measures of reaction time (Deary and Der, 2005, Penke et al., 2012). Taken together, these studies suggest whole body system integrity may support higher order manifestations of cognitive function such as general intelligence whilst acting as the fundamental determinant of health status. However, these studies have not been replicated within a contemporary population and it remains uncertain whether measures of information processing or whole body system integrity help explain the association between general intelligence and health or whether these exposures are independently associated with health.  Another hypothesis is that, along with reflecting greater socioeconomic status, those with higher intelligence are more likely to engage in healthy lifestyle behaviours and thus have better underlying physical health (Deary, 2008). Cardiorespiratory fitness is one of the most robust measures of physical health status and as such is considered a cardiovascular clinical vital sign (Kodama et al., 2009, Ross et al., 2016). Importantly, cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and sedentary behaviour are also associated with cognitive function (Bakrania et al., 2017, Barnes et al., 2003, Freudenberger et al., 2016, Hillman et al., 2008, McAuley et al., 2011, Sabia et al., 2010). Cardiorespiratory fitness has been associated with brain function and structure whilst exercise training interventions have been shown to reduce reaction time, increase brain volume and improve cognitive functioning (Barnes et al., 2003, Colcombe et al., 2004, Colcombe et al., 2006, Erickson et al., 2011, Freudenberger et al., 2016, Ponce-Bravo et al., 2015, Predovan et al., 2012, Rooks et al., 1997). Thus, it is possible that the association between intelligence and mortality are confounded by cardiorespiratory fitness or vice-versa. Alternatively, cardiorespiratory fitness and intelligence may be correlated through sharing some environmental (i.e. exercise) or genetic determinants but reflect largely different systems of overall health and therefore act as independent predictors of mortality.""","""Higher levels of intelligence have consistently been associated with a lower risk of mortality across different populations and age groups (Batterham, Christensen, & Mackinnon, 2009; Calvin et al., 2010; Christensen, Mortensen, Christensen, & Osler, 2016; Iveson, Cukic, Der, Batty, & Deary, 2017).

Cardiorespiratory fitness UK Biobank introduced an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitored sub-maximal exercise test into their suite of physical assessments in each assessment centre towards the end of recruitment. Those with high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure = 180 bpm or diastolic blood pressure = 110 bpm), chest pain, or pregnant women were excluded from the test. The test was terminated if 75% of age-predicted maximum heart rate was reached. The test involved 2 min at a constant workload followed by 4 min of a linearly increasing workload. The start and end workload of the graded exercise test were standardised according to age, height, weight, resting heart rate and sex to ensure a similar relative intensity across the population. Heart rate was monitored before, during, and after the exercise test via a 4-lead ECG. Maximal cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated using previous published criteria (Celis-Morales et al., 2017), involving: 1) Fitting a linear regression line between heart rate and power output between the pre-exercise (rest) and final stage; 2) Extrapolating the regression line to the age-predicted maximal heart rate with the formula: 208–0.7 × age; 3) Using the regression equation for the relationship between work rate (power) and oxygen uptake (oxygen uptake [ml kg- 1 min- 1] = 7 + (10.8 × work rate [Watts])/body mass [kg]) to estimate maximal oxygen uptake. Metabolic equivalents (METs) were calculated through dividing maximal oxygen update by 3.5.  2.3. Fluid intelligence Fluid intelligence was assessed through 13 questions using verbal and numeric reasoning/logic delivered over a two minute period. Each question had five possible responses in addition to “do not know” and “prefer not to answer”; participants were asked to select the correct response via a touch screen computer. Participants were instructed as follows: “In this next test you will have a maximum of two minutes to answer as many questions as possible. Don't spend too long on any one question and you can skip any question if you wish”. Each question used in the test is available through the UK Biobank website (UK Biobank, 2017). The number of correct responses was used as the outcome measure. This measure of fluid intelligence employed in UK Biobank has been shown to have good reliability when repeated after a mean of 4 years (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient = 0.65; p < 0.001) (Lyall et al., 2016).  2.4. Reaction time Simple reaction time was assessed with a timed test of symbol matching conducted on a touch screen computer, similar to the card game snap. Two card shapes with symbols were displayed on a computer screen with participants asked to press a red button with their dominant hand if the two cards had matching symbols. Participants undertook the test seated with the red button placed on a desk in front of them. Ten symbols with simple non-complex shapes were used (equals sign, fir tree, hollow circle, hollow square, H, smiley face, solid circle, solid square, triangle, cross). Participants completed 12 rounds, of which the first 5 were considered training rounds and removed from the analysis. Of the remaining rounds, matched cards were shown in rounds 6, 8, 11 and 12.

Specifically, the association between fluid intelligence and mortality was robust against adjustment for lifestyle behaviours and sociodemographic factors and remained unaffected by further adjustment for reaction time and cardiorespiratory fitness. In the fully adjusted model, each SD higher fluid intelligence score was associated with a 9% reduction in mortality risk. Similarly, each SD faster reaction time and each SD higher cardiorespiratory fitness levels were associated with an 8% and 15% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality, respectively.  By showing that the association between fluid intelligence and mortality is independent of both reaction time (a marker of information processing efficacy and whole body system integrity) and cardiorespiratory fitness (a measure of physical health), this study extends previous research. Our findings are in contrast to another study which reported that the association between intelligence and mortality was attenuated after adjustment for reaction time (Deary & Der, 2005). However, this study had a small sample size (n = 898) and is likely to have been underpowered. For example, although non-significant, each SD lower intelligence score was still associated with a 20% higher risk of mortality after adjustment for reaction time (Deary & Der, 2005). Our study in a large well characterised contemporary cohort suggests that whilst reaction time and intelligence were correlated, adjustment for reaction time had a negligible impact on the association between intelligence and mortality. Further, reaction time was itself independently associated with mortality after adjustment for intelligence. Therefore intelligence and reaction time may work through different pathways in the association with mortality.  A further important finding from this study was that the associations of fluid intelligence and reaction time with mortality was not attenuated after adjustment for cardiorespiratory fitness. Cardiorespiratory fitness is a well-researched and established measure of overall physical health status, with this study supporting previous meta-analyses reporting that each additional 1 MET in cardiorespiratory fitness level is associated with a 13% lower risk of all-cause mortality (Kodama et al., 2009), a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular disease (Kodama et al., 2009), and a 5% lower risk of type 2 diabetes (Zaccardi et al., 2015). It has previously been suggested that differences in health behaviour or health status may confound or explain part of the association of intelligence with mortality (Deary, 2008). Our findings suggest that physical health may in fact have little impact on these associations and that therefore intelligence represents an independent predictor of mortality risk. These findings are consistent with previous research showing that the association of both intelligence and reaction time with mortality is independent of other measures of physical health, such as blood pressure or factors relate to the metabolic syndrome (Batty et al., 2008, Roberts et al., 2009).""","""This study found that fluid intelligence, reaction time and cardiorespiratory fitness were independently associated with all-cause mortality.

Cluster Analysis and Association Rule Mining. Owing to the complex nature of the data and the inclusion of 36 chronic conditions, an overall association rule mining (ARM) analysis would be limited in yielding important associations. Therefore, we developed a 2-step approach to identifying patterns ofmultimorbidity first using a cluster analysis to identify chronic conditions that cluster together and then using ARM to investigate patterns within these clusters more closely. We first used a hierarchical agglomerative clustering approach to create dendrograms that clearly displayed diseases that are associated at different levels or branches of the tree. A binary distance measure was used to produce the distance matrix resulting in more distinctive clusters compared with other proximity measures. We used the Ward method for the dendrogram analysis because this method aims to find compact clusters and minimizes the variance within clusters37 compared with single linkage and average linkage methods, which successively chained observational into 1 cluster.21 Possible clustering solutions were considered to determine the number of clusters to extract, and we used 3 clusters because they gave enough power for ARM analysis within each cluster. We then conducted ARM within each cluster, restricting the maximum number of mined associations to 30 to facilitate clear visualization of the patterns because increasing the number of association rules made the visualizations too complicated but did not change the overall patterns. We made use of the 3 commonly used measurement ratios: support (how frequently the disease combinations appear in the data set), confidence (the conditional probability that a participant who has the antecedent disease will also have the consequent disease), and lift (the ratio of the observed support to that expected if the 2 events were independent). Lift measures the importance of a rule within ARM and, therefore, was considered the main measure of significance in the study. A lift of more than 1 indicates that the antecedent conditions and the consequent conditions appear more often together than expected, which can be interpreted as the antecedent having a positive effect on occurrence of the consequent. A lift of less than 1 indicates that the antecedent and consequent conditions appear less often than expected, which means that the occurrence of the antecedent has a negative effect on the occurrence of the consequent, and a lift close to 1 indicates that the antecedentand the consequent conditions occur as often together as expected, meaning that occurrence of the antecedent has little or no effect on occurrence of the consequent conditions. Hence, the higher the lift, the higher the chance of co-occurrence of the consequent with the antecedent and the more significant the association. Results of ARM analyses are presented using summary tables of association rules and graphical visualizations showing patterns of diseases.""",,Yes,,,""" Subgroup Analyses. Variations of multimorbidity patterns were assessed by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Age was recategorized into 3 subgroups (50, 51-60, and >60 years old) due to the complexity of the mining process required with 6 age groups. Similarly, race/ethnicity was regrouped into 2, comparing the white and nonwhite populations. All the ARM and cluster analyses in this study were performed using R software, version 3.3.1.

When divided into 3 clusters, the first cluster contained only MI and angina with very strong association.

In the third cluster, asthma, depression, and cancer were the epicenter.""",,Yes,,Yes,,,"""To date, there is no standard way to define multimorbidity; however, we used the most common definition, with a wide range of conditions. We also used self-reported data on chronic conditions rather than medical records. However, previous research has shown good agreement between self-reported data and administrative data for chronic conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and asthma, and moderate agreement for more acute conditions associated with chronic conditions, including stroke and MI.41,42 In addition, due to the exploratory nature of cluster analysis, there is no set number of optimal clusters to generate, and different clustering algorithms may generate different numbers of clusters and constituents within the clusters; nevertheless, we used 3 clusters to optimize data mining within the clusters. Another important limitation of agglomerative hierarchical clustering is that each diagnosis can belong to only 1 cluster at a time.... Last, although we found disease clusters and strength of associations between conditions within each cluster, due to the cross-sectional nature of the data, the study cannot establish any causal links between conditions; hence, a longitudinal study with a focus on trajectories of development of these conditions may shed more light on causality.""",,No,,,,,"Makes clinical suggestions based on cross-sectional data ""CONCLUSION We found that almost one-fifth of the present study population had multimorbidity. We also found that conditions such as diabetes, asthma, depression, and cancer were the central point of disease clusters and directly or indirectly related to several conditions in their respective clusters. Because the present research was based on cross-sectional data, further research should focus on longitudinal data to assess trajectories of the development of multimorbidity and their effects on health outcomes. Furthermore, a more integrative multidisciplinary approach focusing on better management and prevention of conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, which are the epicenter of disease clusters and potentially part of the trajectories of several other chronic conditions. In addition to the introduction of specific multimorbidity guidelines, guidelines on the management of individual index conditions should also be examined and potentially revised to include the co-management of a myriad of conditions that cluster around it.""",,Partially,,,"""However, participation in the UK Biobank is voluntary, with higher representation from more affluent socioeconomic groups evidenced by the median Townsend deprivation index of e2.14 compared with e1.87 for the United Kingdom in the 2001 census.35 Considering that multimorbidity is more common in deprived groups, we may have underestimated the prevalence. Nevertheless, individual estimates of chronic conditions in the present study closely mirror those from the General Lifestyle Survey in Great Britain for the same age group and period. For example, the prevalence rates of hypertension, asthma, and cancer, which were the 3 most common conditions in the present study, were 26%, 12%, and 8%, respectively, compared with 24%, 13%, and 5% in the 2009 General Lifestyle Survey in Great Britain. Therefore, we believe that the findings from the present study are largely generalizable to the UK general population.... Although, the present study sample was very large, we studied only participants aged 40 to 69 years, and the clusters may vary in people 70 years and older.""",,Yes,,,Yes,,,"""Grant Support: This study was supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care–East Midlands, the Leicester Clinical Trials Unit, and the NIHR Leicester–Loughborough Diet, Lifestyle, and Physical Activity Biomedical Research Unit, which is a partnership between University Hospitals of Leicester National Health Service Trust, Loughborough University, and the University of Leicester.""",,No,,,,,No,,,,,No,,,,,11/03/2020 20:25,28/04/2020 15:43,ni,,,,,,,,patternsofmultimorbidityinmiddleagedandolderadultsananalysisoftheukbiobankdata,patternsofmultimorbidityinmiddleagedandolderadultsananalysisoftheukbiobankdata,patternsofmultimorbidityinmiddleagedandolderadultsananalysisoftheukbiobankdata,patternsofmultimorbidityinmiddleagedandolderadultsananalysisoftheukbiobankdata,,yes_almost,,,"""This research was conducted using UK Biobank""",,EN-GB,EN-GB,Never,,
