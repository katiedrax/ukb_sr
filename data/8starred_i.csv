Baseline socioeconomic and lifestyle information were collected via a self-completed, touch-screen questionnaire and anthropometric measurements taken by trained staff. Self-reported moderate and vigorous physical activity were converted to METsÂ·minÂ·week-1, and dichotomised to inactive (<600 METsÂ·minÂ·week-1) and active (=600 METsÂ·minÂ·week-1). Dietary information was collected using a self-completed food frequency questionnaire. Frequency of beef, pork and lamb intake (excluding processed meat) and frequency of processed meat intake were recorded. These were converted into probabilities of daily consumption, multiplied by normal portion sizes [7] and then weighted by size of portion: small 0.5, medium 1.0 or large 1.5. We then derived four categories of red/processed meat intake: zero intake and tertiles of consumption for those consuming some. Follow-up information (min 5.33 years and max 9.89 years) on the date of first diagnosis of cancer was obtained via linkage to three routine administrative databases: cancer registrations, death certificates and hospital admissions. Date and cause of death were obtained from death certificates held by the National Health Service (NHS) Information Centre (England and Wales) and the NHS Central Register Scotland (Scotland). Date and cause of hospital admissions were obtained from the Health Episode Statistics (HES) for England and Wales and the Scottish Morbidity Record 01 (SMR01) for Scotland. At the time of analysis, mortality data were available up to 31 January 2016 and hospital admission and cancer registry data until 31 March 2015. Therefore, follow-up was censored at 31 January 2016 or date of death if this occurred earlier. There were 54 participants who withdrew consent from UK Biobank at the time of analysis.

Sociodemographic, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, dietary intake and sleep duration data were collected from the touchscreen questionnaire. Smoking and alcohol status were obtained by asking participants to respond to ‘Prefer not to answer’, ‘Never’, ‘Previous’ and ‘Current’. Physical activity was assessed using adapted questions from the validated short International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)[17] which collects information on the frequency and duration of time spent in walking, moderate and vigorous activity in the previous 7 days. Data processing rules for IPAQ were followed [18]. According to the current UK physical activity guidelines [19] we identified those who reached 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week, or a combination of both. Walking was considered as moderate activity. Participants reported how long they spent watching television (TV) on a typical day. This was asked twice to those who responded >8 hours, therefore high values were deemed robust. Those who reported more than 3 hours/day were identified based upon previous literature [20]. Diet was reported using the Food Frequency Questionnaire [21] and healthy eating was assessed using the UK’s fruit and vegetable guidelines of 5 portions per day [21]. The townsend deprivation index combines information on housing, employment, car availability and social class, with higher values representing lower socioeconomic status. This was calculated before participants joined the UK Biobank and was based on the preceding national census data, with each participant assigned a score corresponding to the home postcode [16].

To measure sleep duration, participants were asked ‘About how many hours sleep do you get in every 24 hours?’ (please include naps). This was asked twice to those who responded >12 hours. As sleep shows a ‘U’ shaped relationship with CM risk [22], we created 3 sleep duration groups of <6 (poor sleep), 6–9 (good sleep), and >9 hours (poor sleep) per night.

Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from: weight (kg)/height(m)2. Weight was measured using the Tanita BC-418MA body composition analyser, to the nearest 0.1 kg and height was measured using a Seca 202 height measure. Waist circumference (cm) was measured at the level of the umbilicus using a Wessex non-stretchable sprung tape measure, which has previously been adopted in large health studies [23]. Participants were asked to adjust clothing for accuracy, and all staff were trained in taking these measures. Self-report disease status (including Sleep Apnoea and hypertension) and medication use was obtained from participants during the touchscreen questionnaire, which was then entered and verified by a UK Biobank nurse after further questioning during the verbal interview. The interview provided extra information such as time of diagnosis, and if the trained nurse decides that the illness or medication had been incorrectly selected, they could remove the selection.

Postmenopausal women completed a touchscreen questionnaire (available online: http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/resources/) including questions on sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and lifestyle habits. Participants self‐reported their age, sex, and ethnicity. Ethnicity was categorized as White or other (mixed, Asian, Black, Chinese, and other). A Townsend deprivation score was computed for all participants using information about employment, car and home ownership, and household overcrowding.20 A higher Townsend deprivation score is indicative of greater levels of an area's socio‐economic deprivation.20 Participants reported their smoking status (never, previous, or current) and their alcohol intake (never, previous, or current). Data on physical activity including frequency (number of days in a typical week that participants performed 10 min or more of walking, moderate, and vigorous physical activity) and duration (minutes spent on each activity category on a typical day) were collected by asking questions similar to those included in the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.21 For each activity category, the frequency was multiplied by the duration and the metabolic equivalent value (3.3 for walking, 4.0 for moderate physical activity, and 8.0 for vigorous physical activity), which were then summed to generate a score of metabolic equivalent minutes of physical activity per week for each participant.

Medical history and current medications
Self‐reported data on medical conditions were collected at baseline by asking participants whether a doctor has diagnosed any cancer or diabetes. Participants reported if they had undergone bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy or were on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Self‐reported data on fracture occurrence (yes or no) over the past 5 years were also collected. Information on X‐ray verification was unavailable.

Quantitative heel ultrasound
Quantitative ultrasound of the heel was performed using the Sahara Clinical Sonometer (Hologic, Bedford, Massachusetts) according to a standardized protocol. Trained staff checked if participants were able to undertake both left and right heel ultrasound measurement. Those with open wounds, breaks or sores around the heel, or metal parts (such as pins) in the heel did not undertake measurement of that heel. Each centre used the same machine model, and quality control was performed with a phantom on a daily basis as per manufacturer's instructions. The mean values for BMDs (g/cm2) and BMD T‐scores for the left and right heel were computed.

Anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance measurements
Height was measured using the SECA 240 height measure (SECA, Hamburg, Germany). Participants removed their socks and footwear and stood flat footed with their heels against a back plate. Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a segmental body composition analyser (Tanita BC‐418MA, Tokyo, Japan). Height and weight were used to calculate BMI as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). Waist circumference was measured at the level of the umbilicus using a tape measure. All these measurements were performed by trained staff....Assessment of outcome
Via the Health and Social Care Information Centre for English and Welsh participants and the Information Services Department for Scottish participants, we ascertained the diagnosis of osteoporosis with or without a pathological fracture until 31 January 2016 for England and Wales and 30 November 2015 for Scotland. Diagnoses of the events were confirmed by primary care physicians and coded according to the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD‐10: M80‐M82)."""

We derived total time spent in sedentary behaviours from the sum of self reported time spent driving, using a computer, and watching television.

Dietary information was collected via the Oxford WebQ, a web based 24 hour recall questionnaire that was developed specifically for use in large population studies.2122 We derived area based socioeconomic status from the postcode of residence, using the Townsend score.23 We calculated age from dates of birth and baseline assessment. We categorised smoking status into never, former, and current smoking. We collected medical history (physician’s diagnosis of depression, stroke, angina, heart attack, hypertension, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or longstanding illness) from the self completed baseline assessment questionnaire. Trained nurses measured height and body weight during the initial assessment centre visit. We calculated body mass index as weight/height2 and used the World Health Organization’s criteria to classify it into categories of underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5 to <25), overweight (25 to <30), obese (30 to <35), obesity class 2 (35 to <40), and obesity class 3 (≥40). Trained nurses measured body composition (body fat and fat free mass) by using bio-impedance.

(not touchscreen though),"""For the UK Biobank project, baseline questionnaires and physical measures (eg, standard anthropometry and spirometry) were collected and blood and urine samples were stored, as described elsewhere.11 502<U+2008>656 individuals were recruited (5% of the eligible population) in the UK Biobank. This study was done under generic approval from the National Health Service National Research Ethics Service (June 17, 2011; Ref 11/NW/0382). Participants provided electronic informed consent for the baseline assessments and the register linkage. Procedures The social isolation scale used by the UK Biobank was constructed from three questions: (1) â€œIncluding yourself, how many people are living together in your household? Include those who usually live in the house such as students living away from home during term time, partners in the armed forces or professions such as pilotsâ€ (1 point for living alone); (2) â€œHow often do you visit friends or family or have them visit you?â€ (1 point for friends and family visit less than once a month); and (3) â€œWhich of the following [leisure/social activities] do you engage in once a week or more often? You may select more than oneâ€ (1 point for no participation in social activities at least weekly). Thus, individuals could score a total of 0â€“3; an individual was defined as socially isolated if he or she scored 2 or 3; those who scored 0 or 1 were classified as not isolated. Similar scales have been used previously in other UK studies.12 Loneliness was assessed with two questions: â€œDo you often feel lonely?â€ (no=0, yes=1) and â€œHow often are you able to confide in someone close to you?â€ (0=almost daily to about once a month; 1=once every few months to never or almost never). An individual was defined as lonely if he or she scored 2, and not lonely if he or she scored 0 or 1. Similar questions are included in scales such as the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale.13 Follow-up for all deaths irrespective of cause started at inclusion in the UK Biobank study (from national death registers) and ended on Aug 14, 2015, or upon death, for all participants. The cause-specific-mortality International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes were as follows: neoplasms (C00â€“D48), diseases of the circulatory system (I05â€“I89), and other diseases (all remaining ICD-10 codes). Details of the assessments of participants' variables are publicly available.14 Briefly, participants completed several touch-screen computer-based questionnaires, and then had a face-to-face interview with a trained researcher. The information collected included basic demographics (sex and age), ethnic origin (white vs other), socioeconomic factors (educational attainment, household income, and postcode of residence with the corresponding Townsend deprivation index score), and chronic diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other long-standing illness, disability, or infirmity). The Townsend deprivation index is an integrated neighbourhood-level measure of unemployment, non-car ownership, non-home ownership, and household overcrowding across the UK.15 To assess biological factors, trained data collectors measured height and weight in all participants during clinic attendance using standard operating procedures, and the body-mass index (BMI) was subsequently calculated. Procedures for measuring systolic and diastolic blood pressure and handgrip strength are reported in the UK Biobank protocol, which is available online.11 Behavioural factors, including cigarette smoking (current smoker [yes or no]; ex-smoker [yes or no]), physical activity (moderate and vigorous), and alcohol intake frequency (at least three times a week vs twice a week or less) were self-reported on a questionnaire. Psychological factors comprised current depressive symptoms and general cognitive capacity. Depressive symptoms were measured using the frequency of four items from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ):16, 17 (1) depressed mood, (2) disinterest or absence of enthusiasm, (3) tenseness or restlessness, and (4) tiredness or lethargy in the previous 2 weeks. General cognitive capacity (numeric memory, verbalâ€“numerical reasoning, reaction time, and visual memory) was assessed by use of a touch-screen application.18 Self-rated health was assessed using the following question answered on a four-point scale (1=poor; 4=excellent): â€œIn general, how would you rate your overall health?â€!"

Grip strength (GS)
GS was assessed once in each hand using a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Jamar J00105, Lafayette, IN, USA), which can measure isometric grip force up to 90 kilograms. The device has good reliability and reproducibility.21 Staff calibrated the device at the start of each measurement day. Each participant was asked to sit upright on a chair with their forearm on the armrest, and then grasp the handle of the device in their right hand. They were required to maintain a 90° angle of their elbow adjacent to their side so that their thumb would face upwards, while squeezing the handle as strongly as possible for ~3 s. The same protocol was performed with the left hand. For the current analysis, we used average values of the two hands; unless the value from only one hand was available (n=233). Sex- and age-specific quintiles of GS were generated for analyses (Supplementary Table 1).

Adiposity measures
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing measured weight (kg) by measured height squared (m2). Waist circumference (WC) was measured by a tape measure at the level of the umbilicus. For the present analyses, BMI (kg m−2) was categorised as normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9), obesity class I (30.0–34.9) and obesity class II (⩾35.0). A total of 62 men and 373 women who were underweight (BMI<18.5 kg m−2) were excluded from the analyses because of small sample size. Three categories of WC were generated according to the following sex-specific cut points: ⩽79.9 cm, 80.0–87.9 cm and ⩾88.0 cm for women, and ⩽93.9 cm, 94.0–101.9 cm and ⩾102.0 cm for men.22

Cognitive performanceFive cognitive measures were administered through a compu-terised touchscreen interface[22]. Time to complete allfivecognitive tests was approximately 15 min. The tests were designedspecifically for the UK Biobank to allow administration at scalewithout examiner supervision. The tasks show evidence of an un-derlying performance factor and good stability over time, with theexception of visual memory performance, which has a compara-tively lower intraclass correlation coefficient[22]. Thefive tasks involved the following instructions:Reasoning: This task assessed the ability to solve 13 verbal andnumeric reasoning problems. Each problem hadfive possibleresponse options. The dependent variable was the total numberof correct answers given (range 0e13) within a 2-min period,with higher scores indicating better performance.Basic reaction time: This task was delivered in the style of thecard game,â€˜snapâ€™, and requested participants to respond with abutton press when they detected the appearance of a matchingpair of symbols. The dependent variable was the mean responsetime in milliseconds across 12 matching-pair trials. RT valueswere log-transformed because of skewed distribution (ln x).Numeric short-term memory: In this task, a string of numberswas presented on the screen, which subsequently disappeared.Participants were then asked to enter the number string frommemory, in the reverse order, through a keypad. The dependentvariable was the maximum string length recalled correctly(range: 0e12), with higher scores indicating better perfor-mance. The test was discontinued afterfive successive incorrectresponses at string lengthÂ¼2.Visual memory: In this task, six card pairs of symbols were pre-sented on-screen in a random pattern.

For the purpose of the present analyses,those scoringâ€˜several daysâ€™,â€˜more than half the daysâ€™orâ€˜nearlyevery dayâ€™were coded in theâ€˜depressive symptomsâ€™category, whilethose scoringâ€˜not at allâ€™were considered in theâ€˜no depressivesymptomsâ€™category. In addition, participants were dichotomisedaccording to whether they reported hypertension or any cardio-vascular disease.2.7. AnalysesDescriptive data presentation included mean values and stan-dard deviations and the proportion of the sample reporting specificquestionnaire response options. Questionnaire response options,â€˜do not knowâ€™orâ€˜prefer not to answerâ€™, were handled as missingvalues. For cognitive dependent variables, the sample size variedacross tests because the reasoning and prospective memory testswere added after the commencement of data collection, while thenumeric memory task was included from the outset but subse-quently removed because of time constraints.In afirst step (unadjusted analyses, model 1), the associationbetween insomnia status (those with frequent insomnia symptomsvs. those without frequent insomnia symptoms) and cognitiveperformance was analysed using four linear models, with insomniastatus as the single predictor variable and reasoning, basic reactiontime, numeric memory, and visual memory as dependent variables.The association between insomnia status and prospective memoryperformance was investigated using a logistic model. In a secondstep (model 2), age, sex, socioeconomic status, and education wereadded as covariates in the linear and logistic models described inmodel 1. In a third step (model 3), chronotype (with the interme-diate type as the reference category), sleep medication use, BMI as acontinuous variable, hypertension, antihypertensive medication,cardiovascular disease, depressive symptoms, and psychotropicmedication were added as further covariates. In afinal step (model4), sleep duration (with 7e9 h as the reference category) wasinserted as an additional predictor of cognitive performance. Wetherefore report unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted relation-ships between insomnia status and cognitive outcomes. For chro-notype, sleep duration and sleep medication, we report only thefully adjusted relationships (model 4) controlling for all de-mographic, clinical and remaining sleep variables. Given that weanalysedfive cognitive tests, the alpha level was set atp<0.01 forall analyses"""

The complete battery is detailed in an open-access baseline paper.13 The first of these was a task with thirteen logic/reasoning-type questions and a two-minute time labelled fluid intelligence in the UK Biobank protocol but hereafter referred to as verbal-numerical reasoning (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=20016). The maximum score was 13. The Cronbach alpha coefficient for these items has been reported elsewhere as 0.62,14 and the task shows reasonable reliability across on average 4.3 years in 4253 participants with repeat data (r = 0.65, P <0.001). The next task was a visual memory test called pairs matching (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/label.cgi?id=100030), where participants were asked to memorize the positions of six card pairs, and then match them from memory while making as few errors as possible. We refer to this test as the memory task from here on. Scores on the memory test are for the number of errors that each participant made, and higher scores are, therefore, worse. The memory test did not show good reliability in 19 017 participants with longitudinal data (r = 0.16, P <0.001); however, this may partly be due to slight floor effects where most participants made few-to-no errors on repeat assessment, and it will be a more informative test variable when measured at baseline. Finally, participants completed a timed test, measured in milliseconds, of symbol matching; similar to the common card game Snap (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=20023) which we refer to as reaction time....As part of the baseline assessment, participants were asked whether a physician had diagnosed myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, hypertension or diabetes. We defined CAD as angina and/or myocardial infarction. Participants self-reported other conditions freely on a separate assessment screen (e.g. atrial fibrillation). Townsend deprivation indices were derived from postcode of residence.15 They provide an area-based measure of socioeconomic deprivation derived from aggregated data on car ownership, household overcrowding, owner-occupation and unemployment. Education was based on self-report of the highest qualification achieved and dichotomised into university/college degree or less. (We have conducted additional analysis and found that analysing the ‘education’ variable as a more fine-grained ordinal variable of ‘degree; A-levels/AS-levels; O-levels/GCSEs; CSEs; NVQ/HND/HNC; none’ made no difference to the final results; data available upon request.) Participants self-reported their ethnic group and we recoded this into white and non-white.16 Body mass index was measured by trained research staff. Participants removed their shoes and heavy outer clothing. Weight was measured, to the nearest 0.1 kg, using a Tanita BC-418 MA body composition analyser and height using a Seca 202 height measure. Body mass index (BMI) was derived from: weight (kg)/(height (m) × height (m)). Smoking was coded as never, previous, or current smoker based on self-report. Frequency of alcohol intake was recorded as never, special occasions only, 1–3 times per month, 1–2 times per week, 3–4 times per week, daily/almost daily. Participants self-reported whether they were on medication for cholesterol, high blood pressure or on insulin. The minority of participants that did not know or chose not to answer were removed."""

Waist circumference and hip circumference were measured using the Wessex non-stretchable sprung tape measurement. Waist-to-hip ratio was calculated by dividing waist circumference by hip circumference.

The questionnaire asked participants to report any doctor's diagnosis of cardiovascular comorbidities such as coronary artery disease (combining angina and heart attack), stroke, and diabetes, and for all regular medications to be listed. Weight and height measurements were obtained for calculation of BMI (kg/m2); systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP) were measured using the Omron HEM-7015IT digital blood pressure monitor. History of fracture was self-reported. All participants were asked if they had fractured or broken a bone in the past five years and if yes, at which of the following specific sites: ankle, leg, hip, spine, wrist, arm or other bones. A further question asked if the fracture resulted from a simple fall (low-trauma fracture). Combining this information, ‘fragility fracture’ was defined as a low-trauma (occurring as a result of a fall) fracture involving the hip, spine, wrist or arm. ‘Other’ and ‘unknown’ fractures were excluded from subsequent analyses. Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) (db/MHz) and speed of sound (SOS) (m/s) were measured at least twice on each calcaneum with a SAHARA sonometer (Hologic, Marlborough, USA) and left and right mean values used for analysis.

Postmenopausal women completed a touchscreen questionnaire (available online: http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/resources/) including questions on sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and lifestyle habits. Participants self‐reported their age, sex, and ethnicity. Ethnicity was categorized as White or other (mixed, Asian, Black, Chinese, and other). A Townsend deprivation score was computed for all participants using information about employment, car and home ownership, and household overcrowding.20 A higher Townsend deprivation score is indicative of greater levels of an area's socio‐economic deprivation.20 Participants reported their smoking status (never, previous, or current) and their alcohol intake (never, previous, or current). Data on physical activity including frequency (number of days in a typical week that participants performed 10 min or more of walking, moderate, and vigorous physical activity) and duration (minutes spent on each activity category on a typical day) were collected by asking questions similar to those included in the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.21 For each activity category, the frequency was multiplied by the duration and the metabolic equivalent value (3.3 for walking, 4.0 for moderate physical activity, and 8.0 for vigorous physical activity), which were then summed to generate a score of metabolic equivalent minutes of physical activity per week for each participant.

Medical history and current medications
Self‐reported data on medical conditions were collected at baseline by asking participants whether a doctor has diagnosed any cancer or diabetes. Participants reported if they had undergone bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy or were on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Self‐reported data on fracture occurrence (yes or no) over the past 5 years were also collected. Information on X‐ray verification was unavailable.

Quantitative heel ultrasound
Quantitative ultrasound of the heel was performed using the Sahara Clinical Sonometer (Hologic, Bedford, Massachusetts) according to a standardized protocol. Trained staff checked if participants were able to undertake both left and right heel ultrasound measurement. Those with open wounds, breaks or sores around the heel, or metal parts (such as pins) in the heel did not undertake measurement of that heel. Each centre used the same machine model, and quality control was performed with a phantom on a daily basis as per manufacturer's instructions. The mean values for BMDs (g/cm2) and BMD T‐scores for the left and right heel were computed.

Anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance measurements
Height was measured using the SECA 240 height measure (SECA, Hamburg, Germany). Participants removed their socks and footwear and stood flat footed with their heels against a back plate. Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a segmental body composition analyser (Tanita BC‐418MA, Tokyo, Japan). Height and weight were used to calculate BMI as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). Waist circumference was measured at the level of the umbilicus using a tape measure. All these measurements were performed by trained staff....Assessment of outcome
Via the Health and Social Care Information Centre for English and Welsh participants and the Information Services Department for Scottish participants, we ascertained the diagnosis of osteoporosis with or without a pathological fracture until 31 January 2016 for England and Wales and 30 November 2015 for Scotland.

This was considered the most inclusive sample of â€˜usable spirogramsâ€™. When end-blow quality was also considered, 58% of the cohort had evidence of a good plateau and both FEV1 and FVC reproducible within 150 mL, the criteria recommended by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) Task Force on Standardisation of Spirometry.17 This subgroup of 58% was considered to be the â€˜best qualityâ€™ spirograms, among which to evaluate the relative importance of FEV1 and FVC as predictors of mortality. The present analysis is based on deaths occurring up to mid-August 2015, a mean follow-up period of 6.5 years. There were 2401 deaths among 149 343 lifelong non-smokers aged 40â€“69 years of white ethnicity who performed â€˜usable spirograms. Deaths from respiratory disease, circulatory disease, cancer and all other causes were coded using ICD10 (chapters J, I, C and all others, respectively). Smoking history was self reported. Socioeconomic status was measured at the level of residential area, using the Townsend Deprivation Index, grouped into quartiles for analysis. Biobank recruitment centre was used as an additional covariate to adjust for possible regional differences. Adjustment of spirometric measures for gender, age and height The Global Lung Initiative (GLI) 2012 reference equations for white ethnic groups18 were used in both sets of data to standardise FEV1 and FVC for age, sex and height. The GLI-2012 equations generate a â€˜z-scoreâ€™ which represents the relative position of an individual among the distribution predicted for lifelong non-smokers with no history of lung disease of the same gender, age and height. This allows for the spread of predicted values to differ by age, height and gender, expressing the relative ranking of an individual in terms of a SD (z) score. For each individual in the analysis, there were three GLI-2012 z-scores, corresponding to their relative ranking for FEV1 (zFEV1), FVC (zFVC) and the ratio FEV1:FVC (zFEVFVC). Outlying observations were excluded by restricting all the analyses in both data sets to values of zFEV1 and zFVC within the range -5 to +5 z-score units. This exclusion removed 0.2% of UKB participants, 0.5% of participants in the national health surveys aged 40â€“69 years and 0.3% of national health survey participants aged 70 years or more."""""

Participants were followed via record linkage to the NHS Central Registers which provide information on cancer diagnoses coded according to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) [20]....Coffee consumption
Information on coffee consumption was collected at the time of the recruitment visit using a short touchscreen self-reported food frequency questionnaire that included 29 questions on commonly consumed food groups based on the expected distribution in the UK as well as some common sources of various nutrients [21, 22]. This questionnaire asked about the frequency of consumption over the past year of vegetables, fruit, fish, meats, cheese, salt added to food, tea, water, milk, bread, cereal, as well as cups of coffee (“How many cups of coffee do you drink each day?”) and type of coffee most commonly consumed (“What type of coffee do you usually drink?”). To assess validity and reproducibility of this diet assessment tool, the results reported on the initial questionnaire were compared with the diet reported at a subsequent repeated assessment (with the median time between two assessments = 4.4 years) as well as with the results from 24-h food frequency questionnaire completed during follow-up by a sub-sample of participants. There was good agreement between reported consumption at recruitment and at the repeat assessment as well as good agreement between diet from initial and 24-h food frequency questionnaires suggesting that UK Biobank food frequency questionnaire was able to reliably rank participants according to their consumption of main food groups [22].

Even though a subset of individuals in the UK Biobank also completed follow-up questions on coffee consumption at subsequent visits, as follow-up information on coffee consumption was missing for majority of the participants (> 95%), only baseline data were used in the analysis. Consistent with previous studies [5], coffee consumption categories were defined as < 7 cups/week, 1 cup/day, 2–3 cups/day, and 4+ cups/day.

Covariate information
Information on breast cancer risk factors was extracted from baseline questionnaire and updates. Weight and height for body mass index (BMI) calculation were measured at every visit to the study assessment center. BMI at recruitment was calculated as kg/m2. Race/ethnicity was defined using 2001 Census and the Health Survey for England classifications and re-coded for the purpose of this analysis due to extremely small numbers for racial/ethnic groups other than Caucasian. Family history of breast cancer was defined as having any first degree relative with breast cancer diagnosis. As inherited genetic susceptibility may not have fully manifested at the time of the entry into the study, we supplemented data on family history from baseline with those from the follow-up visits to fully capture this information.

UK Biobank introduced an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitored sub-maximal exercise test into their suite of physical assessments in each assessment centre towards the end of recruitment. Those with high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 bpm or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 bpm), chest pain, or pregnant women were excluded from the test. The test was terminated if 75% of age-predicted maximum heart rate was reached. The test involved 2 min at a constant workload followed by 4 min of a linearly increasing workload. The start and end workload of the graded exercise test were standardised according to age, height, weight, resting heart rate and sex to ensure a similar relative intensity across the population. Heart rate was monitored before, during, and after the exercise test via a 4-lead ECG. Maximal cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated using previous published criteria (Celis-Morales et al., 2017), involving: 1) Fitting a linear regression line between heart rate and power output between the pre-exercise (rest) and final stage; 2) Extrapolating the regression line to the age-predicted maximal heart rate with the formula: 208–0.7 × age; 3) Using the regression equation for the relationship between work rate (power) and oxygen uptake (oxygen uptake [ml kg− 1 min− 1] = 7 + (10.8 × work rate [Watts])/body mass [kg]) to estimate maximal oxygen uptake. Metabolic equivalents (METs) were calculated through dividing maximal oxygen update by 3.5.

2.3. Fluid intelligence
Fluid intelligence was assessed through 13 questions using verbal and numeric reasoning/logic delivered over a two minute period. Each question had five possible responses in addition to “do not know” and “prefer not to answer”; participants were asked to select the correct response via a touch screen computer. Participants were instructed as follows: “In this next test you will have a maximum of two minutes to answer as many questions as possible. Don't spend too long on any one question and you can skip any question if you wish”. Each question used in the test is available through the UK Biobank website (UK Biobank, 2017). The number of correct responses was used as the outcome measure. This measure of fluid intelligence employed in UK Biobank has been shown to have good reliability when repeated after a mean of 4 years (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient = 0.65; p < 0.001) (Lyall et al., 2016).

2.4. Reaction time
Simple reaction time was assessed with a timed test of symbol matching conducted on a touch screen computer, similar to the card game snap. Two card shapes with symbols were displayed on a computer screen with participants asked to press a red button with their dominant hand if the two cards had matching symbols. Participants undertook the test seated with the red button placed on a desk in front of them. Ten symbols with simple non-complex shapes were used (equals sign, fir tree, hollow circle, hollow square, H, smiley face, solid circle, solid square, triangle, cross). Participants completed 12 rounds, of which the first 5 were considered training rounds and removed from the analysis. Of the remaining rounds, matched cards were shown in rounds 6, 8, 11 and 12. Reaction time was calculated as the average time taken to correctly identify a match. Times under 50 ms were considered to be due to anticipation rather than reaction and removed from the analysis. Participants were allowed 2000 ms to react to each round.

2.5. Anthropometric, demographic, health and lifestyle data
This study utilised the following covariate data within UK Biobank: anthropometric (body mass index (BMI); demographic (age, sex, ethnicity, social deprivation [Townsend index], employment status and education level); health status (prevalent cancer, number of prevalent non-cancer illnesses, and number of prescribed medications); and lifestyle (smoking [never, past, current], alcohol, fresh fruit [pieces per day], raw vegetables or salad [portion per day], cooked vegetable [portion per day], sleep [hours per night], TV viewing time [hours per day], and physical activity [weekly frequency of any walking, moderate-, or vigorous-intensity physical activity undertaken lasting at least 10 min]). Alcohol was assessed through a frequency questionnaire ranging from never to daily or almost daily. Further details for each measure are available elsewhere (UK Biobank, 2007).

2.6. Assessment of mortality status and data inclusion
UK Biobank undertook comprehensive data linkage for mortality status using national records in England, Wales and Scotland. Using a unique identifier collected at baseline (e.g. NHS number), information about mortality status, date of death and causes of death were obtained from National Health Service (NHS) Information Centre for participants from England and Wales, and from the NHS Central Register, for participants from Scotland. Linkage captured all deaths occurring until 31st January 2016 for England and 30th November 2015 for Scotland."""
