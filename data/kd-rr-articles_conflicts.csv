The establishment of the UK Biobank provided a unique opportunity to investigate this relationship.  Patients and methods We studied a sample of UK Biobank participants of White ethnicity aged 40–69 years old who underwent autorefraction (N=91 592) and were classified as myopic (=-0.75 Dioptres (D)), highly myopic (=-6.00 D), or non-myopic (>-0.75 D). Self-reported age at diagnosis of past medical conditions was ascertained during an interview with a nurse at a Biobank assessment centre. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for myopia or high myopia associated with a diagnosis before age 17 years of each of nine febrile illnesses, after adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, highest educational qualification, and birth order).""","""We studied a sample of UK Biobank participants of White ethnicity aged 40–69 years old who underwent autorefraction (N = 91 592) and were classified as myopic (= -0.75 Dioptres (D)), highly myopic (= -6.00 D), or nonmyopic (4- 0.75 D).

For instance, Duke Elder21 states, ‘It has long been observed that myopia has a habit of appearing or increasing in periods of ill-health or after disease: the common belief that it starts in youth with measles or some such childish febrile illness is not without truth.’ However, apart from a small study by Hirsch22 examining the age of contracting measles in myopic vs non-myopic school children, little research into this question has been carried out in recent decades.

Participants reporting glaucoma were more likely to be older (mean 61.4 vs 56.7 years, P<0.001) and male (2.1% vs 1.4%, P=0.001). The rate of reported glaucoma was significantly higher in Black (3.28%, P<0.001) and Asian (2.14%, P=0.009) participants compared with White participants (1.62%, reference). Cases of reported glaucoma had a higher mean IOP (18 mm Hg both eyes, P<0.001), lower corneal hysteresis (9.96 right eye, 9.89 left eye, P<0.001), and lower visual acuity (0.09 logMAR right eye, 0.08 logMAR left eye, P<0.001) compared with those without (16 mm Hg both eyes, hysteresis 10.67 right eye, 10.63 left eye, 0.03 logMAR right eye, 0.02 logMAR left eye). The mean Townsend deprivation index was -0.72 for those reporting glaucoma and -0.95 for those without (P<0.001), indicating greater relative deprivation in those reporting glaucoma. Multivariable logistic regression showed that people in the lowest income group (<£18 000/year) were significantly more likely to report a diagnosis of glaucoma compared with any other income level (P<0.01). We observed increasing glaucoma risk across the full range of income categories, with highest risk among those of lowest income, and no evidence of a threshold effect.

Among people of European origin, primary open-angle glaucoma accounts for around 70–85% of all cases of glaucoma, hence risk factors for POAG would be expected to predominate as determinants of disease in a UK population. Self-reported glaucoma cases were older and more likely to be male than those without the diagnosis. The rate of self-reported glaucoma increased nonlinearly with age. Black and Asian people were significantly more likely to report a diagnosis of glaucoma than White participants. Among our study participants, the overall self-reported glaucoma rate was 1.7% in people aged 40–69 years. This rate of disease appears lower than figures from population prevalence studies in European derived populations aged 40 years and older (2.08% Baltimore Whites, USA; 2.0% Melbourne, Australia; 2.9% Egna-Neumarkt, Italy), where participants were all examined for glaucoma7, 21, 22 It has been well established in population-based studies in industrialized nations that at least 50% of all glaucoma remains undiagnosed.10, 23, 24 One recent study in the US using NHANES data puts the proportion of undiagnosed disease at 78%.25 We therefore expect the rate of self-reported glaucoma in UK Biobank to be lower than published population surveys owing to undiagnosed disease.  One of the most striking finding of our study was that, among UK Biobank participants, those who report a diagnosis of glaucoma were more likely to have a lower income and be from a relatively less affluent background. Participants in the lowest income group (<£18 000/year) were significantly more likely to have self-reported glaucoma, compared with any other income category, after adjusting for age, sex, race, IOP, and visual acuity. The mean Townsend deprivation index was -0.72 for those reporting glaucoma and -0.95 for those without (P<0.001). This indicates that both groups are less deprived than the UK average (index=0, scores>0 indicate relative deprivation), but those reporting a diagnosis of glaucoma were less likely to be as affluent as those without disease. Furthermore, we observed a gradient toward higher rates of glaucoma with decreasing income across the socioeconomic spectrum. Among a cohort who are less deprived than the UK average, the findings of reduced affluence among those reporting disease than in those who do not, and of a trend toward increased rate of disease across the spectrum of income groups are both novel, and important for understanding the mechanisms which drive the previously reported association between socioeconomic deprivation and late presentation of glaucoma.""","""Self-reported glaucoma cases were older and more likely to be male than those without the diagnosis.

These two facts give an important new perspective to views on the relationship between glaucoma and socioeconomics. There are undoubtedly barriers to eye care for detection and treatment.

It has long been known that reactivation of the PNS is the main contributor to interindividual HRR differences and that the effect of this reactivation is strongest in the first 30 seconds after termination of exercise.8 Despite this knowledge, HRR is commonly determined at 1 minute after termination of exercise.1, 3, 6 Recently, a study by McCrory et al9 described HRR within a 1-minute interval after an orthostatic challenge, and found that speed of HRR in the immediate 20 seconds was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality.

Worldwide, more than 350 million individuals suffer from depression [1]. As a contributor to the burden of morbidity, it is ranked third globally and first in middle and high income countries, with morbidity expected to rise further [2]. In the United Kingdom alone, around 1 in 20 adults experience an episode of depression annually, and it is the third most common reason by patients to consult their general practitioner [3]. Major depression carries a significant economic and health burden [4, 5]. It is associated with increased physical comorbidity [6], reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [7], and impaired function in work, school and family life [8], as well as increased mortality [9], including suicides [10]. The prevalence of obesity is increasing both in the UK and worldwide [11], leading to suggestions of an “obesity pandemic” or “globesity”. As with depression, we know that adiposity is associated with reduced physical well-being [12], poor HRQoL [13–15], and higher societal costs [16].  The relationship between these two important public health problems has been the focus of an increasing number of studies over recent years, but these studies have produced inconsistent results [17, 18]. Some have reported positive associations [19] whilst others have reported negative [20] or no associations [21]. We previously showed that adiposity was significantly associated with poor overall HRQoL [13], but this was largely due to reductions in the physical component of HRQoL, with the mental component reduced only among morbidly obese and increased among overweight [14]. Furthermore, we found that poor mental health was confined to obese women under 45 years of age, and the apparent protective role of being overweight was confined to men aged 45–59 years [19].  A meta-analysis of population studies reported a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.26 (95% CI 1.17, 1.36) for the association between obesity and depression [22]. This association was only significant in women (OR 1.32). Of the 17 studies included, 16 used body mass index (BMI) as a measure of obesity. Another recent meta-analysis reported a pooled OR of 1.38 (95% CI 1.22, 1.57) for the association between central obesity and depression [23]. A total of 15 studies were included in this review, of which 14 used waist circumference (WC) as the measure of central obesity. Several studies showed that the association between obesity and depression is stronger in women [19, 24]. In contrast, a recent large study demonstrated that adiposity was a significant predictor of depression only in men [25].  In these two recent meta-analyses, most used self-reported adiposity measurements, and many were not adjusted for important potential confounders such as socio-economic status, physical comorbidity, and use of psychotropic medications. Only BMI and WC have been used as measures of adiposity, and they were simply dichotomized into obese and not obese, thereby losing information on the relationship across the spectrum of adiposity such as whether there is a dose relationship. There is some evidence that the relationship between adiposity and depression varies according to the level of adiposity [26] and that waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and body fat percentage (BF%) may also be associated with depression [27]. One recent, comparatively smaller German study (N = 4907) examined the association between obesity and depression, using the continuous measure of BMI, WC and WHR but not the direct measurement of BF% [28]. Overall, there is a paucity of larger studies which used other than BMI measures in exploring this association.""","""The relationship between these two important public health problems has been the focus of an increasing number of studies over recent years, but these studies have produced inconsistent results [17,18].

The information collected included demographics (including sex, age, ethnicity, employment status, and postcode of residence), lifestyle factors (including smoking status and alcohol consumption), self-reported physician-diagnosed comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and cancer), current medication and past or current experience of depressive and manic symptoms.  Anthropometric measurements (including height, weight, WC, hip circumference and BF%) were measured by trained data collectors, using standard operating procedures. BF% was calculated using a Tanita BC-418MA body composition analyser. WHR was derived by dividing WC (measured by a Wessex non-stretchable sprung tape at the level of the umbilicus) by hip circumference (measured at the widest point using the same device). BMI was derived by dividing weight in kilograms (measured after removal of shoes and heavy outer clothing using a Tanita BC-418MA device) by the square of height in metres (measured without shoes using the Seca 202 device) [30].  Definitions BMI was classified as; underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal-weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), and obese (=30 kg/m2). Obesity was further classified as class I (30.0-34.9 kg/m2), class II (35.0-39.9 kg/m2) or class III obese (=40 kg/m2). Among men, WC was classified as normal-weight (<94 cm), overweight (94–101 cm), and obese (=102 cm). The corresponding cut-off values for women were <80, 80–87 and =88 cm, respectively. WHR was classified among men as; normal weight (<0.90), overweight (0.90-0.99) or obese (=1) and the corresponding cut-off values for women were <0.80, 0.80-0.84 and =0.85, respectively. BF% was classified among men as; normal weight (<18%), overweight (18-25%) and obese (>25%). The equivalent cut-off values for women were <25, 25–32 and >32, respectively.  Age was categorised into three groups; 39–49, 50–60, and 61–70 years. Townsend score quintile (from 1 least deprived to 5 most deprived) was used as an indicator of the participant’s socio-economic status. This is a validated measure which is determined on the basis of postcode of residence, and is derived from the following household information collected in the most recent census; car ownership, the number of people living in a house, home ownership, and employment status [31]. Frequency of alcohol consumption (daily/almost daily, 3–4 times/week, 1–2 times/week, 1–3 times/month, special occasions and never), smoking status (never, former and current), ethnic group (white, mixed, Asian/Asian British [Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and other Asian background], black/black British, Chinese and other) and employment status (in paid employment, retired, looking after home, unemployed, not working due to sickness or disability and student) were self-reported. Comorbidity was defined as self-report of a doctor’s diagnosis of one or more of the following conditions; cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease or stroke), hypertension, diabetes or cancer. Text information on all current medications was used to identify participants taking “any psychotropic medication” based on a list of 125 eligible generic and proprietary names compiled by three psychiatrists (DS, BC and DM).  Our classification of probable major depression was based on criteria published previously by our group [32]. We convened a series of meetings of Biobank-approved researchers focusing on mental health and cognition (membership DJS, JPP, DM, NC, JG, MH, BC, BN, DM, JE, ID and BR) and, after a number of iterations of proposed criteria, a definition for probable major depression was agreed. It should be noted that this approach represented a pragmatic synthesis of the data which was available to us as part of the UK Biobank baseline assessments and that the validity of this diagnosis is in part supported by differences between the probable depression group and controls in terms of gender distribution, socioeconomic status, self-reported health rating, current depressive symptoms and smoking status. Probable major depression and current depressive symptoms were therefore defined using information from specific questions on the severity and duration of both depressed mood and anhedonia, questions on past help-seeking behaviour for mental health and answers to the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) [33]. Participants were then classified as having probable major depression if they reported a lifetime history of having ever had either depressed mood for a period of at least two weeks or a period of at least two weeks of being unenthusiastic/disinterested (anhedonic); plus they had reported ever having seen a general practitioner or psychiatrist for ‘nerves, anxiety, depression” in the past.

Diet group classification For classification of diet groups, relevant dietary information from the touch-screen questionnaire was used. Participants were asked their frequency of consumption of processed meat, beef, lamb or mutton, pork, chicken, turkey or other poultry, oily fish, or other types of fish, in 6 categories of frequency ranging from “Never” to “Once or more daily.” Participants were also asked whether they never ate eggs or foods containing eggs or dairy products.  On the basis of these questions, 6 diet groups (regular meat eaters, low meat eaters, poultry eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans) were defined for the white population. To rank the participants by weekly red and processed-meat consumption based on the touch-screen, we summed the frequencies for processed meat, beef, pork, and lamb or mutton by using the following coding: “Never” = 0, “Less than once a week” = 0.5, “Once a week” = 1, “2–4 times a week” = 3, “5–6 times a week” = 5.5, and “Once or more daily” = 7. Regular meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating red (beef, lamb or mutton, or pork) or processed meat >3 times/wk, whereas low meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating red or processed meat =3 times/wk, regardless of what else they ate. Poultry eaters were defined as participants who reported never consuming any red or processed meat but who did eat poultry. Fish eaters were participants who reported that they never consumed any red meat, processed meat, or poultry but who ate oily or nonoily fish. Vegetarians were defined as participants who reported that they never consumed any meat or fish, and vegans were participants who reported that they never consumed any meat, fish, eggs or foods containing eggs, or dairy products.

Introduction Fragility fractures, sarcopenia (the presence of low skeletal muscle mass and function), and frailty are becoming more prevalent in our aging society with their attendant disabilities and costs for health and social care. Moreover, maintaining mobility and wellbeing in our aging society is important. The costs of falls and fractures are £2.3 billion per year in the UK ($17 billion in the US), with one in two women and one in five men experiencing a fracture over the age of 50 years [1,2]. Estimates of the costs of sarcopenia are $US18.5B, and they are set to rise [3]. Osteoporosis (the presence of low bone density, BMD) is a well-recognised risk factor for fragility fractures [4,5,6,7], but more recently the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass, function and sarcopenia, as well as frailty, have also been recognised as risk factors for osteoporosis, falls, and fractures [6,7,8]. Skeletal muscle provides protection through hormonal or endocrine interactions between muscle and bone, muscle force generated mechanical signals, and maintenance of postural balance. So, conserving skeletal muscle mass and function is important for prevention of fractures [9,10,11]. Both osteoporosis and sarcopenia are highly prevalent. Estimates for the prevalence of osteoporosis in the community are 22.1% and 5.5% in European women and men, aged 50 years and over [1]. In the USA 77.1% of women and 10.0% of men, over the age of 65 years have either osteoporosis or low bone density [12]. Sarcopenia has been identified in between 1% and 29% in community dwelling people over the age of 60 years, with estimates for those living in long term care of between 14% and 33% [13,14]. Recent predictions for Europe estimate that the prevalence of sarcopenia will almost double overall in the elderly population to 22.3% by 2045 [13,14]. The prevalence of frailty is 25% in those over the age in 80 [12]. It is clear that the prevalence of all these conditions (osteoporosis, sarcopenia and frailty, and number of fractures) will rise in line with the increasing age of populations in the UK and USA, as will the costs of health and social care for their treatment [3,13,15,16]. Prior to a diagnosis of these conditions, gradual losses in bone density and skeletal muscle mass and strength (sarcopenic risk factors) occur in a continuum starting from the age 30 years, with increasing rates of loss in those over the age of 60 years [17,18]. Importantly, these conditions, once present, are difficult to reverse and current treatment strategies are limited. Therefore, maintaining skeletal muscle and bone health during aging is important in our populations, and new preventative strategies in middle and younger older ages (middle age 40–60 years, younger older age 60 to 70 years) are needed. Dietary composition can impact on the mechanisms leading to age-related loss of bone density, skeletal muscle mass or function. Calcium is well established as essential for bone health, as is protein for skeletal muscle, but other nutrients that are integral to bone and muscle physiology, such as magnesium (Mg), have not been investigated extensively and concurrently in relation to both skeletal muscle and bone health in both men and women of middle and younger older age [19,20,21,22,23]. The mechanism by which Mg may protect against osteoporosis and sarcopenic risk factors may be through the protection from cytokine induced stimulation of osteoclast activity or the protection of loss of skeletal muscle mass or strength. For osteoporosis, Mg can influence osteoblast activity as well as hydroxyapatite crystal formation, and regulation of calcium homeostasis through interactions between parathyroid hormone and vitamin D [24,25]. For skeletal muscle, Mg has direct physiological and metabolic roles, including maintenance of protein synthesis and turnover. Mg may also affect muscle performance though energy metabolism (production of ATP), transmembrane transport, and muscle contraction and relaxation [26,27]. Moreover, skeletal muscle and bone contain the majority of Mg in the body with 60% found in bone and 27% in muscle, indicating the importance of Mg to the musculoskeletal system [28]. Understanding the gender specific differences in associations between diet and skeletal muscle and bone health is important, as men attain a higher proportion of skeletal muscle mass, grip strength, and BMD at younger ages than women. Also, the effects of aging differ, with men losing a higher percentage of muscle mass and a lower percentage of BMD than women as they age. Few studies have investigated the sarcopenic risk factors with dietary magnesium in middle and older aged populations and even fewer investigated these associations according to gender. Grip strength has only been investigated in five previous studies with dietary or supplemental Mg intake or blood concentrations, and only one of these was in men [20,21,27,29,30]. Even fewer studies have investigated the associations between Mg and skeletal muscle mass, with none investigating associations in men only [20,21,29,30]. Of the greater number of studies investigating dietary magnesium and bone density, most were in older women (34), with only five investigating associations independently in men [25,31,32,33,34].""","""The mechanism by which Mg may protect against osteoporosis and sarcopenic risk factors may be through the protection from cytokine induced stimulation of osteoclast activity or the protection of loss of skeletal muscle mass or strength.""",Yes,Yes,,"""To our knowledge, no studies have previously investigated dietary Mg and measures of both bone and skeletal muscle health concurrently in the same cohort, independently in men and women.

Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height squared in metres. Indices of fat free mass. In order to control for increases in FFM with height and weight, the following indices were used [39]. Firstly, FFM as a percentage of body weight (FFM%), was calculated as total FFM (in kg divided by total body weight (in kg) multiplied by 100). Secondly, FFM divided by BMI (FFMBMI) was calculated since this takes into account the increase in body size, scaled for height, and it was calculated as total FFM divided by BMI [40]. Thirdly, total appendicular lean mass (ALM) was used because skeletal muscle mass in the limbs is more directly related to issues of mobility and the onset of sarcopenia was calculated as the sum of FFM in the arms and legs. ALM was scaled by BMI (ALMBMI) calculated as ALM divided by BMI [40]. Bone Mineral Density. The Sahara Clinical Bone Sonometer was used to estimate bone mineral density (BMD) based on ultrasound measurement of the calcaneus (heel) [41]. In the early stages of recruitment, only a single heel was used for the measurement, but in the later stages, measurements were made on both heels.

Study Participants The Biobank dataset consisted of 502,655 people, however we excluded the following (see Figure 1): those without dietary or other relevant missing data, non-white ethnicity, pregnant women, those with a grip strength of zero, those with extremes of FFM, BMD, Mg, energy, protein, EI:EER, or BMI (bioelectrical impedance measures are considered unreliable at BMI extremes) [38]. These exclusions left a total of 156,575 people in the study (73,323 men and 82,098 women in the muscle analyses, 36,118 men and 40,441 women in the BMD analysis).  2.6. Statistical Analysis We examined the association between dietary Mg, skeletal muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density using multivariable regression techniques. First, for men and women separately, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of each outcome variable for each sex-specific quintile of dietary Mg (model 1). Then, we fitted Mg quintiles as the predictor in an adjusted model, again for men and women separately, with the covariates included. For this adjusted model, we calculated adjusted means with standard errors of each outcome for each sex-specific quintile of dietary Mg (model 2). For both models, we tested for a trend (p value given as p trend in the tables) in these unadjusted (model 1) and adjusted (model 2) values by fitting the median value of the outcome variable within each quintile as a continuous variable. Model 2 was also adjusted for sex-specific quintile of percentage energy from protein, smoking status, age group, physical activity levels, dietary energy intake, the ratio of EI:EER, the number of food questionnaires completed, whether the participant took Mg supplements, and, for women, whether the participant took HRT and whether she had experienced menopause. For the measures of skeletal muscle mass and strength, we also adjusted for whether the participant had taken cholesterol-lowering drugs. For BMD, we also adjusted for BMI, dietary calcium, dietary vitamin D, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. For grip strength, we additionally adjusted for height. To determine whether there might be a different relationship between Mg and the outcomes of interest by age, we repeated the analyses stratified by age (<60 years and =60 years). Loss of skeletal muscle can occur during the loss of body weight and also in certain conditions of chronic disease e.g., respiratory disease, diabetes, and chronic renal failure [46,47,48]. To test whether our analyses were affected by the loss of body weight that was linked to the presence of chronic illness, we performed a sensitivity analysis by dropping individuals from the study if they answered yes to both of two questions: (1) whether individuals had seen a weight change compared to a year ago and (2) whether they had a long-standing illness, disability or infirmity n = 7730. We then repeated the analyses on this smaller dataset (n = 148,845). To understand the association between total fat free mass and total appendicular lean mass, the correlation was calculated in men and women. In order to compare the relative scale of the associations between Mg intake and the different indices of skeletal muscle and bone, the differences in the values for these outcomes, between the top and bottom quintiles of Mg intake, were calculated as a percentage as follows; the difference between quintile 5 and quintile 1 of the values for the outcome indices were calculated and the percentage difference calculated as a percentage of the value of quintile 1.

This is important as these factors are associated with an increased risk of falls, frailty, sarcopenia, and fractures. Higher intakes of dietary Mg were positively associated with a greater grip strength, indices of skeletal muscle mass, and BMD in both men and women aged 39–72 years continuously across the distribution of intakes. The inter-quintile differences associated with dietary Mg ranged from 1.1% and 2.4% for grip strength to 5.1% and 5.5% for FFMBMI, in men and women, respectively, but were smaller for BMD being 2.9% and 0.9%. When comparing these differences with previously measured longitudinal annual losses of skeletal muscle mass, grip strength and bone density, the associations found across the distribution of Mg intake ranged from one quarter in men to three quarters in women, for grip strength, and from 3 times in men to 5.1 times in women for FFM%. For BMD, these comparisons were 1.9 times in women and 9.7 times in men. Moreover, the associations were in the main of a similar scale in younger, as well as older, men and women, indicating that dietary Mg has relevance for protection for skeletal muscle and bone outcomes both in middle and younger older age groups. In men over the age of 60 years, the interquintile differences found in grip strength were around twice that of younger men. Whilst these findings are cross-sectional, they indicate that it is likely to be important for older men to consume sufficient dietary magnesium. Our findings were also significant after statistical adjustment for the important factors that contribute to skeletal muscle and bone loss: Age, smoking, and physical activity, and in women, HRT medication. For skeletal muscle our results remained significant after adjustment for dietary protein, which has been traditionally regarded as the most important nutrient for skeletal muscle health. For bone density, we also accounted for dietary and supplemental intakes of calcium. Thus, our results are independent of protein for muscle and of calcium for bone which have well established structural and physiological roles for musculoskeletal health. Mg also has important metabolic, physiological, and structural roles in the musculoskeletal system""",""" to investigate the associations between intakes of Mg concurrently with measurements of bone and skeletal muscle health in middle and older aged men and women...Higher intakes of dietary Mg were positively associated with a greater grip strength, indices of skeletal muscle mass, and BMD in both men and women aged 39–72 years continuously across the distribution of intakes.

Laser surgery was also more common among those in higher categories of accommodation tenure and with higher educational attainment. There was an increasing trend in frequency of surgery with increasing income in those of pre-retirement age (ie, 40 to 60 years). Among the employed, frequency decreased with age: 7.7% (7.1 to 8.3) (40 to 49 years), 4.2% (3.9 to 4.5) (50 to 59 years), and 2.6 (2.3 to 3.0) (60 to 69 years).  Distribution of Refractive Surgery by Sociodemographic Factors The distributions of age, sex, ethnicity, and socio-economic factors differed between those who had bilateral surgery and those who had refractive error and would have been eligible for refractive surgery but did not report it (Table 4). There were no such differences observed when comparing with the unilateral surgery group.A higher proportion of participants who had refractive surgery were women (60.4% vs 55.9%), were younger (49% vs 26%, age 40 to 54 years), with higher income (34% vs 26% in the range >52k), and of minority ethnicity (89.2% vs 91.6% white) (Table 4). There was some indication that those having surgery were less likely to be in the lowest or highest category of educational qualification or accommodation tenure.  Frequency of Other Self-Reported Ocular Conditions Of note, the frequency of other self-reported eye conditions was higher in the group reporting laser refractive surgery (27.5%) than in those with refractive error but no surgery (11.4%) and those without refractive error (8.1%) (Table 5). Specifically, cataract was reported by 8.9%, ocular trauma by 1.7%, retinal detachment by 2.1%, diabetic eye disease by 3.3%, and glaucoma by 2.5% of those who reported having laser refractive surgery. Because these were cross-sectional data, it was not possible to determine whether these additional ocular disorders occurred before or after refractive surgery.Distribution and Frequency of General Health and Happiness and Social Activity Outcomes There were no consistent differences found in report of general health, happiness, or visits from/to friends between the 2 groups in either distribution or frequency of laser eye surgery (Table 3, Table 6).

Although we are not able to validate reports of surgery, the distribution of mean manifest spherical equivalent in those who report having bilateral laser surgery shows considerable shift toward the emmetropic range of spherical equivalent, as would be expected after refractive surgery. It may be that laser surgery has been under-reported but, by the same token, the mean spherical equivalent distribution in those who do not report surgery appears to be appropriate for this age group of population; therefore, if there is some under-report of surgery, it seems unlikely to have influenced the observed results.  Data on the precise type and date of surgery and prior ophthalmic measures are not available in UK Biobank. This prevents analysis of the data to address clinical (versus epidemiological) questions about the “success” of procedures in terms of postoperative refraction.17  We were not able to differentiate between prior and postoperative onset of concurrent ocular conditions. Nevertheless, there was a higher level of self-report of other ocular conditions among those with refractive error who had laser surgery than among eligible subjects who did not report surgery. There are a number of potential explanations. For example, misreporting/misclassification of self-reported eye illness, a higher rate of postoperative conditions in those who had laser surgery, or inappropriate selection for surgery of those with pre-existing eye illness""",,"""This study has provided an estimate of frequency of laser refractive surgery in a contemporary adult UK population and some understanding of the characteristics of those electing to undergo this treatment, which is almost exclusively undertaken outside the National Health Service. The personal financial cost of surgery is reflected in the profile of those undergoing surgery. The social outcomes associated with surgery are consistent with previously reported reasons for seeking treatment. Although the cross-sectional nature of the study limits the analysis of the association with reported ocular comorbidity, the frequency of ocular conditions conventionally considered contra-indications to laser refractive surgery does raise the possibility that extant guidance on patient selection is not being followed.""","Although the cross-sectional nature of the study limits the analysis of the association with reported ocular comorbidity, the frequency of ocular conditions conventionally considered contraindications to laser refractive surgery does raise the possibility that extant guidance on patient selection is not being followed.",Yes,Yes,,"""Representativeness The UK Biobank population is older and has fewer men than the UK Census 2011 dataB; however, the distribution of ethnic variation is comparable.

Dynamic stress vulnerability models have reported links between reduced exposure to green environments and enhanced vulnerability to the negative health effects of stressful life events, which can result in increments in the proportion of the population with mental disorders and an overall reduction in the mental capital of cities.2, 3, 4 In recent years, mental disorders, including mood disorders, have emerged as a leading cause of global disease burden. They also act as risk factors for the development of communicable and non-communicable diseases, and contribute to accidental and non-accidental injuries.5, 6, 7 The UK's total annual expenditure on brain disorders was estimated to be approximately €134 billion in 2010, of which €19·24 billion was incurred on mood disorders, accounting for approximately 3·9 million annual cases or 8·73% of all brain disorders.8  The causes of mental health disorders are complex, with a long latency between exposures and subsequent incidence and progression. A systems-based life course approach towards enhancing the mental capital of cities and wellbeing of their populations has been proposed.9 The importance of such a holistic approach has been emphasised by the inclusion of mental health within the Sustainable Development Goals.10, 11 Relatedly, exposure to residential green environment has also been regarded as an effective upstream-level urban intervention with an aim to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders.12  Research in context  Evidence before this study  We searched online databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO, Scopus, and Google/Google Scholar databases, for studies and reports published in English between Jan 1, 1984, and Feb 10, 2018, using a combination of search terms, including “residential greenness”, “green space”, “NDVI”, or “built environment”, and “mental health”, “depression”, or “major depressive disorder”.  Mental health disorders have emerged as a leading cause of the global burden of disease. At the same time, the present unprecedented pace of urbanisation and an increasing proportion of impervious built-up spaces in our cities have resulted in reduced exposures to salutogenic green environments. Several studies have examined the links between exposure to green environments and mental health, with most studies suggesting beneficial effects. Green exposure has been measured in terms of access to green spaces (proportion of green spaces within a residential neighbourhood) as well as the general salutogenic potential of green environments. The protective effects of residential green have been hypothesised to originate from one or more of its functional roles: as restorative stress-relieving spaces; supportive social interaction spaces promoting a sense of community; active living spaces facilitating physical activity; and natural filters ameliorating the adverse effects of negative exposures such as air, noise, and thermal pollution.  Notwithstanding the evidence generated so far, the links between residential green exposure and mental health still remain equivocal in adults. Many of the studies linking residential green exposure with mental health have used coarse measures of green exposure, whereas a few studies have used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index as an index of salutogenic green, although of low-to-moderate spatial resolution. Most studies so far have been small scale and done in homogeneous environmental settings, resulting in limited statistical power and generalisability....Some studies report a beneficial effect of contact with green environments on health, in general,13, 14, 15 and more specifically, with regard to stress, mood, and mental health.16, 17 Several studies have established a protective independent association between various indicators of mental health and the percentage of green space within a residential neighbourhood,18, 19, 20, 21 the amount of tree cover in an urban area,22 and the overall exposure of individuals to salutogenic green environments.23, 24, 25 These protective effects of residential green spaces have been explained in terms of four mechanisms related to their specific functional roles: restorative, stress-relieving spaces;4, 26, 27, 28 supportive, social interaction spaces that promote a sense of community;29 active living spaces that facilitate physical activity;30, 31, 32 and natural filters that ameliorate the adverse effects of air, noise, and thermal pollution.33, 34, 35  Despite the substantial body of evidence, the links between residential green exposure and mental health still remain far from conclusive in adults.17 Many of the studies have used coarse measures of green exposure, expressed as a proportion of greenness based on land cover maps within a specific catchment or census geography, thereby neglecting to include private gardens, street trees, and green spaces that do not meet a specific criterion, such as a size threshold, and hindering the study's replicability and comparability. A few studies have used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an index of greenery derived from Landsat satellite data, as an overall measure of green exposure (although at a low-to-moderate resolution).

UKBUMP is a high-resolution spatial database of health-influencing environment exposures modelled within multiscale residential neighbourhoods of each UK Biobank participant's geocoded dwelling. Environmental exposure metrics were developed through spatial and network analyses of data from multiple UK-wide spatial databases, resulting in multiple exposure variables related to greenness, urban density, destination accessibility, street-level accessibility, terrain, and deprivation.43, 44 Briefly, UKBUMP was developed by geocoding participants' dwelling addresses to the level of building footprints, delineating multiscale dwelling neighbourhoods by defining street network buffers centred on the geocoded dwelling locations in ArcGIS12 Network Analyst, and measuring environmental exposures within these functional neighbourhoods. After linking the exposure metrics to the participants' dwelling locations, the data were reanonymised. Accurate data on building-level land uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated Transport Network databases, whereas residential greenness was modelled from high-resolution (50 × 50 cm2) colour infrared data captured during aerial photography with the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4.43  Residential greenness Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank participants' dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote sensing device. Chlorophyll in healthy vegetation absorbs radiation in the visible red region (630–690 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflects radiation in the near-infrared region (760–900 nm). This differential in the absorbance and reflectance of wavelengths by chlorophyll is used as a proxy for green quality and intensity. The differential is measured using the following formula:   The formula includes the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the visible (RED) and near-infrared regions (NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Index scores range between -1 and 1, with higher values indicating higher densities of green vegetation.  In the present study, NDVI greenness was derived from a series of 0·5 m resolution, colour-infrared imagery collected by Bluesky (Ashby-De-La-Zouch, UK) with the help of specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Summer-time images of the study areas collected over similar temporal scales (across the baseline phase of the UK Biobank study) were stitched together to avoid temporal mismatch. After excluding large water bodies, we modelled mean NDVI within a 500 m residential buffer of each UK Biobank participant. Selection of a 500 m catchment area for measuring residential green exposures was based on our previous studies46, 47 and on other previous reports48, 49 that used a quarter mile (400–500 m) neighbourhood for measuring NDVI greenness.""","""Residential   environment   exposure   data   were   derived   from  the  UK  Biobank  Urban  Morphometric  Platform  (UKBUMP)...Residential  exposure  to  salutogenic  green  environment  was   measured   in   terms   of   mean   NDVI   within   a   500   m   catchment   radius   of   geocoded   UK   Biobank   participants’   dwellings...

As such, the metric is able to differentiate between flat and hilly surface within the residential catchment.  Exposure to PM2·5 obtained from UK Biobank's linked air pollution exposure data was used as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution. The measurement was based on monitoring on three occasions over a 14 day period during the cold, warm, and intermediate seasons of the year. Individual annual exposure to particulate matter concentrations around geocoded residential addresses was derived from land-use regression models.50  Built environment Built-environment metrics from UKBUMP were assessed within a 1 km street catchment of participants' dwellings. Street-level movement density was modelled in terms of through-movement potential of the street segments, also termed as betweenness centrality in graph theoretic terminology. The method has been used in active living research and described elsewhere.51, 52 The UK-wide street network data for the study area comprised approximately 4 million street segments, which were extracted from the OS MasterMap Integrated Transport Network database, transcribed into an access graph model, and subjected to network analysis in sDNA53 to model street-level movement density. Movement density is expressed as the simulated counts of movement through each link in the network, given its relative position and topological connectivity with other segments within the network. The measure also acts as a proxy for relative accessibility and centrality of a place. Betweenness centrality of x in a graph of N links might be defined as:  <U+025B> <U+025B>  In the formula, y and z are the geodesic endpoints; Ry is the set of links within a defined neighbourhood catchment from y; L(y) is the length of link y and L(z) is the length of link z; and P(z) is the proportion of link z within the defined radius.

Socioeconomic status was assessed at household and neighbourhood levels in terms of mean annual household income before tax and Townsend deprivation index scores,54 which is a composite index of four postcode-level socioeconomic status variables (household overcrowding, unemployment, non-home ownership, and non-car ownership), with a higher score indicative of lower neighbourhood socioeconomic status.  We used participation in leisure and social activities as a proxy for social interaction and support. Level of participation was based on response to the questionnaire: “Which of the following do you attend once a week or more often?

UKBUMP is a high-resolution spatial database of health-influencing environment exposures modelled within multiscale residential neighbourhoods of each UK Biobank participant's geocoded dwelling. Environmental exposure metrics were developed through spatial and network analyses of data from multiple UK-wide spatial databases, resulting in multiple exposure variables related to greenness, urban density, destination accessibility, street-level accessibility, terrain, and deprivation.43, 44 Briefly, UKBUMP was developed by geocoding participants' dwelling addresses to the level of building footprints, delineating multiscale dwelling neighbourhoods by defining street network buffers centred on the geocoded dwelling locations in ArcGIS12 Network Analyst, and measuring environmental exposures within these functional neighbourhoods. After linking the exposure metrics to the participants' dwelling locations, the data were reanonymised. Accurate data on building-level land uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated Transport Network databases, whereas residential greenness was modelled from high-resolution (50 × 50 cm2) colour infrared data captured during aerial photography with the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4.43  Residential greenness Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank participants' dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote sensing device. Chlorophyll in healthy vegetation absorbs radiation in the visible red region (630–690 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflects radiation in the near-infrared region (760–900 nm). This differential in the absorbance and reflectance of wavelengths by chlorophyll is used as a proxy for green quality and intensity. The differential is measured using the following formula:   The formula includes the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the visible (RED) and near-infrared regions (NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Index scores range between -1 and 1, with higher values indicating higher densities of green vegetation.  In the present study, NDVI greenness was derived from a series of 0·5 m resolution, colour-infrared imagery collected by Bluesky (Ashby-De-La-Zouch, UK) with the help of specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Summer-time images of the study areas collected over similar temporal scales (across the baseline phase of the UK Biobank study) were stitched together to avoid temporal mismatch. After excluding large water bodies, we modelled mean NDVI within a 500 m residential buffer of each UK Biobank participant. Selection of a 500 m catchment area for measuring residential green exposures was based on our previous studies46, 47 and on other previous reports48, 49 that used a quarter mile (400–500 m) neighbourhood for measuring NDVI greenness.  Physical environment Among the physical environment exposures, terrain was modelled in ArcGIS12 Spatial Analyst from a 5 m resolution Bluesky digital terrain model and expressed as variability (SD) of slope, in degrees, within a 0·5 km residential catchment of UK Biobank participants' dwellings.

UKBUMP is a high-resolution spatial database of health-influencing environment exposures modelled within multiscale residential neighbourhoods of each UK Biobank participant's geocoded dwelling. Environmental exposure metrics were developed through spatial and network analyses of data from multiple UK-wide spatial databases, resulting in multiple exposure variables related to greenness, urban density, destination accessibility, street-level accessibility, terrain, and deprivation.43, 44 Briefly, UKBUMP was developed by geocoding participants' dwelling addresses to the level of building footprints, delineating multiscale dwelling neighbourhoods by defining street network buffers centred on the geocoded dwelling locations in ArcGIS12 Network Analyst, and measuring environmental exposures within these functional neighbourhoods. After linking the exposure metrics to the participants' dwelling locations, the data were reanonymised. Accurate data on building-level land uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated Transport Network databases, whereas residential greenness was modelled from high-resolution (50 × 50 cm2) colour infrared data captured during aerial photography with the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4.43  Residential greenness Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank participants' dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote sensing device. Chlorophyll in healthy vegetation absorbs radiation in the visible red region (630–690 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflects radiation in the near-infrared region (760–900 nm). This differential in the absorbance and reflectance of wavelengths by chlorophyll is used as a proxy for green quality and intensity. The differential is measured using the following formula:   The formula includes the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the visible (RED) and near-infrared regions (NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Index scores range between -1 and 1, with higher values indicating higher densities of green vegetation.  In the present study, NDVI greenness was derived from a series of 0·5 m resolution, colour-infrared imagery collected by Bluesky (Ashby-De-La-Zouch, UK) with the help of specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Summer-time images of the study areas collected over similar temporal scales (across the baseline phase of the UK Biobank study) were stitched together to avoid temporal mismatch. After excluding large water bodies, we modelled mean NDVI within a 500 m residential buffer of each UK Biobank participant. Selection of a 500 m catchment area for measuring residential green exposures was based on our previous studies46, 47 and on other previous reports48, 49 that used a quarter mile (400–500 m) neighbourhood for measuring NDVI greenness.  Physical environment Among the physical environment exposures, terrain was modelled in ArcGIS12 Spatial Analyst from a 5 m resolution Bluesky digital terrain model and expressed as variability (SD) of slope, in degrees, within a 0·5 km residential catchment of UK Biobank participants' dwellings. As such, the metric is able to differentiate between flat and hilly surface within the residential catchment.  Exposure to PM2·5 obtained from UK Biobank's linked air pollution exposure data was used as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution. The measurement was based on monitoring on three occasions over a 14 day period during the cold, warm, and intermediate seasons of the year. Individual annual exposure to particulate matter concentrations around geocoded residential addresses was derived from land-use regression models.50  Built environment Built-environment metrics from UKBUMP were assessed within a 1 km street catchment of participants' dwellings. Street-level movement density was modelled in terms of through-movement potential of the street segments, also termed as betweenness centrality in graph theoretic terminology. The method has been used in active living research and described elsewhere.51, 52 The UK-wide street network data for the study area comprised approximately 4 million street segments, which were extracted from the OS MasterMap Integrated Transport Network database, transcribed into an access graph model, and subjected to network analysis in sDNA53 to model street-level movement density. Movement density is expressed as the simulated counts of movement through each link in the network, given its relative position and topological connectivity with other segments within the network. The measure also acts as a proxy for relative accessibility and centrality of a place. Betweenness centrality of x in a graph of N links might be defined as:  <U+025B> <U+025B>  In the formula, y and z are the geodesic endpoints; Ry is the set of links within a defined neighbourhood catchment from y; L(y) is the length of link y and L(z) is the length of link z; and P(z) is the proportion of link z within the defined radius.  The origin-destination function (OD) is defined as:   An objective index of urbanicity within a 1 km residential catchment was developed from the UKBUMP built-environment variables to investigate associations between residential greenness and major depressive disorder, stratified by urbanicity quartiles. Urbanicity was defined as:   The formula includes the density of residential housing (resid), retail (retail), and public transport (PT) in units per km2 street catchment, in addition to street-level movement density (street movement).  Individual-level covariates On the basis of previous scientific literature, the study adjusted for demographic covariates (age, sex, highest educational qualification, and employment status), smoking status, and prevalent comorbidities (body-mass index [BMI] status, doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease, and diabetes).  Socioeconomic status was assessed at household and neighbourhood levels in terms of mean annual household income before tax and Townsend deprivation index scores,54 which is a composite index of four postcode-level socioeconomic status variables (household overcrowding, unemployment, non-home ownership, and non-car ownership), with a higher score indicative of lower neighbourhood socioeconomic status.  We used participation in leisure and social activities as a proxy for social interaction and support. Level of participation was based on response to the questionnaire: “Which of the following do you attend once a week or more often? (You can select more than one)”; with available responses being none; pub or social club; religious group; sports club or gym; and adult education class or other group activity. Responses were converted into a six-factor variable: none, pub or social club, religious group, sports club or gym, adult education class and other, and combination of two or more activities.

The origin-destination function (OD) is defined as:   An objective index of urbanicity within a 1 km residential catchment was developed from the UKBUMP built-environment variables to investigate associations between residential greenness and major depressive disorder, stratified by urbanicity quartiles. Urbanicity was defined as:   The formula includes the density of residential housing (resid), retail (retail), and public transport (PT) in units per km2 street catchment, in addition to street-level movement density (street movement).  Individual-level covariates On the basis of previous scientific literature, the study adjusted for demographic covariates (age, sex, highest educational qualification, and employment status), smoking status, and prevalent comorbidities (body-mass index [BMI] status, doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease, and diabetes).  Socioeconomic status was assessed at household and neighbourhood levels in terms of mean annual household income before tax and Townsend deprivation index scores,54 which is a composite index of four postcode-level socioeconomic status variables (household overcrowding, unemployment, non-home ownership, and non-car ownership), with a higher score indicative of lower neighbourhood socioeconomic status.  We used participation in leisure and social activities as a proxy for social interaction and support. Level of participation was based on response to the questionnaire: “Which of the following do you attend once a week or more often? (You can select more than one)”; with available responses being none; pub or social club; religious group; sports club or gym; and adult education class or other group activity. Responses were converted into a six-factor variable: none, pub or social club, religious group, sports club or gym, adult education class and other, and combination of two or more activities.  Statistical analyses The prevalence of lifetime experience of probable major depressive disorder was modelled as a two factor variable (case or non-case) as per UK Biobank's assessment protocol. Age was coded as a three-factor variable (38–50 years, 51–60 years, or 61–73 years) and sex as a two-factor variable (female or male). Highest educational attainment was defined as a five-factor variable (none; O levels, GCSEs, or CSEs; A levels or AS levels; NVQ, HND, HNC, or other professional qualification; or college or university degree) and employment as a three-factor variable (employed; retired; or unemployed, home maker, or other). Mean annual household income before tax was expressed as a four-factor variable (<£18 000, £18 000–£30 999, £31 000–£51 999, or =£52 000). The household income data were available for 82 839 participants in the analytical sample. Townsend scores were categorised into quintiles and used as a five-factor variable. Smoking status was coded as non-smoker, previous smoker, and current smoker. Doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease was transformed into a four-factor variable (none; high blood pressure; heart attack, angina, or stroke; or both high blood pressure and heart attack, angina, or stroke) and diabetes was coded as a two-factor variables (yes or no). Measured BMI status was expressed as a three-factor variable (<25 kg/m2; =25 kg/m2 and <30 kg/m2; or =30 kg/m2). Terrain variability and walkability (expressed as movement density) were transformed into quartiles.  The study followed a multi-layered analyses strategy.

""",Yes,Yes,,"""Introduction Outdoor air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and ground-level ozone (O3) are associated with acute and chronic illnesses including cancer, asthma, stroke, heart disease and diabetes1. Possible links with cognitive decline have received research attention over the past decade, summarised in five recent systematic reviews2,3,4,5,6. Although confounding background factors such as deprivation and education may partially account for observed associations with cognitive outcomes, it has been postulated that exposure to air pollution has a causal influence via harmful effects on the brain. There is evidence from animal and human studies that air pollutants are linked to inflammatory processes and morphological changes in the brain, such as upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin-1 alpha and beta, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha), activation of microglia and reactive oxygen species, alpha-synuclein deposition, and decreases in dendritic spine density and branching in the hippocampus7,8,9,10,11. These may result from infiltration of pollutants such as ultrafine particulate matter into brain tissue, via the olfactory nerve or the blood-brain barrier11,12, with possible contributions through pulmonary inflammation and downstream effects on systemic circulation13. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality are elevated in association with air pollution exposure14,15,16, and neuroimaging studies have shown associations with atrophy, infarcts, white matter hyperintensities and altered cerebrovascular haemodynamics17,18.  Associations of generally small effect size have been reported in cross-sectional studies of air pollution exposure and cognitive test performance19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26, although others have reported primarily null results27,28. Inconsistent small or null effects have also been shown in studies of cognitive score change over intervals of two to five years29,30,31. A smaller number of studies have examined associations with clinical cognitive disorders. In cross-sectional and case-control studies, air pollutant exposure has been linked with greater odds of global and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI)32 and Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia33. Cohort studies investigating dementia incidence over follow-up periods of up to 15 years have reported greater hazard ratios associated with air pollutant exposure34,35,36 and proximity to major roads37. Heterogeneity of study populations, measures and statistical adjustment methods means that none of the five systematic reviews published to date has included a meta-analysis of effect size estimates. Considerable uncertainty therefore remains regarding the likely magnitude of any association.  Large study samples are needed for the reliable detection of associations of small effect size. Cross-sectional studies investigating the relationship between air pollution exposure and performance on cognitive tests have used samples ranging from n = 39922 to n = 15,97326, and longitudinal studies of cognitive score change have ranged from n = 2,86730 to n = 20,15029. The inconsistent findings and imprecision of the effect size estimates from these studies may indicate the need for samples which are larger still. Previous studies have also varied considerably in the air pollutant exposures that have been measured—most frequently particulate matter, with gas pollutants studied less often—and in the outcomes investigated, encompassing a range of different cognitive assessments or dementia diagnoses. Furthermore, the type and number of possible confounding variables adjusted in statistical analyses have varied widely: most studies have adjusted for sociodemographic factors (including age, gender, ethnicity, education and socioeconomic status), and some have taken account of lifestyle factors such as smoking and physical activity. No study to date has examined the influence of time spent outdoors, despite the fact that the pollution measures predominantly capture neighbourhood air quality rather than individual-level exposure; it might be expected that the magnitude of the relationship between neighbourhood pollution measures and cognitive outcomes would be greater among those who spend more time outdoors.""","""Outdoor air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and ground-level ozone (O3) are associated with acute and chronic illnesses including cancer, asthma, stroke, heart disease and diabetes. Possible links with cognitive decline have received research attention over the past decade, summarised in fIve recent systematic reviews2–6. Although confounding background factors such as deprivation and education may partially account for observed associations with cognitive outcomes, it has been postulated that exposure to air pollution has a causal influence via harmful effects on the brain.""",Yes,Yes,,"""No study to date has examined the influence of time spent outdoors, despite the fact that the pollution measures predominantly capture neighbourhood air quality rather than individual-level exposure; it might be expected that the magnitude of the relationship between neighbourhood pollution measures and cognitive outcomes would be greater among those who spend more time outdoors.

Air pollution measures UK Biobank air pollution data: Air pollution and local environment measures were provided by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (http://www.sahsu.org/) as part of the BioSHaRE-EU Environmental Determinants of Health Project (http://www.bioshare.eu/), and were linked centrally to the assessment data by UK Biobank analysts (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/EnviroExposEst.pdf). These measures were modelled at participants’ baseline residential addresses. A total of 7,221 addresses (approximately 1.4%) could not be geo-coded and therefore have missing data. Particulate matter of up to 10 µm diameter (PM10, PM2.5 to 10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and total nitrogen oxides (NOx) were measured as annual average values in µg/m3. Estimates for the years 2005 to 2007 were derived from European Union (EU)-wide air pollution maps (resolution 100 m × 100 m). The X, Y coordinates of participants’ baseline addresses were overlaid on these maps (projected to the British National Grid) and the corresponding air pollution concentration of the 100 m × 100 m grid cell was assigned to the coordinate. These data were from a land use regression (LUR) model for western Europe based on >1500 EuroAirnet monitoring sites, which also included satellite-derived air pollution estimates to improve the model performance44. Estimates for the year 2010 were modelled for each address using a LUR model developed as part of the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE; http://www.escapeproject.eu/)45,46. ESCAPE estimates for PM in 2010 are valid up to 400 km from the monitoring area (Greater London), but the accuracy of estimates beyond this range (n = 33,935 addresses) was unknown and so these were coded as missing within the central UK Biobank dataset. Where a pollutant measure was available for more than one year, data for the earliest available year were analysed, to minimise uncertainty about the temporal order of exposure and outcome. The PM10 measure was for 2007; PM2.5 to 10 and PM2.5 were for 2010; NO2 was for 2005; and NOx was for 2010.  Defra air pollution data: The UK Biobank air pollution data described above were mapped to participants’ baseline addresses, without taking account of address history at the time the pollutant measure was recorded. Separate data were made available subsequently by UK Biobank regarding participants’ past address history (east and north coordinates rounded to 1 km), and the date the participant was first recorded at each location. These were used in the present study to map air pollution data provided by the UK Government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) (https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data). Modelled data47 for the same pollutants in the same years as above (PM10 for 2007; PM2.5 to 10 and PM2.5 for 2010; NO2 for 2005; and NOx for 2010) were mapped to participants’ addresses in the relevant year. These data were used only in sensitivity analyses, described below.  Other local environment measures Population density (urban/rural) was classified categorically by UK Biobank, by combining each participant’s baseline residential postcode with data generated from the 2001 census, using the GeoConvert tool provided by the UK Data Service Census Support (http://geoconvert.mimas.ac.uk/). Road traffic measures were provided for the year 2008 from the Road Traffic Statistics Branch at the Department for Transport attached to the local road network; traffic data for unmonitored links were estimates based on surrounding monitored links. A major road was defined as a road with traffic intensity >5000 motor vehicles per 24 hours. Traffic intensity on the nearest major road was measured as the average total number of motor vehicles per 24 hours. Proximity to the nearest major road was calculated as the inverse distance (1/m) from the residential location. Data were also available regarding noise pollution, and these were included in supplementary analyses to address potential residual confounding (see Data analysis section below). Noise estimates for the year 2009 were modelled using a version of the Common NOise aSSessment methOdS (CNOSSOS-EU) noise model48,49; average level of noise pollution in decibels was calculated as a weighted level measured over a 24-hour period, with a 10 decibel penalty added between 23:00 h and 07:00 h.  Sociodemographic and lifestyle measures Age was recorded in whole years. Gender was self-reported as male or female. Self-reported ethnic background was grouped categorically as white, Asian/Asian British, black/black British, Chinese, or mixed/other ethnic group. Neighbourhood-level socioeconomic status was measured using the Townsend index of material deprivation50. This was calculated by UK Biobank immediately before the baseline date, based on census data regarding unemployment, car ownership, home ownership and household overcrowding; each participant was assigned a score corresponding to the census output area in which their residential postcode was located, with higher values indicating greater relative deprivation (see Supplementary Methods). Educational qualifications were self-reported, and for the present study were dichotomised according to whether or not participants held a university/college degree. Self-reported smoking status data were used by UK Biobank to categorise participants as current, former or never smokers; these were dichotomised for the present study as ‘ever smoker’ (current or former) versus ‘never smoker’. Physical activity in a typical week was recorded using self-reported items from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form51, and was converted into a single measure of total physical activity in metabolic equivalent of task (MET) hours per week, weighted by intensity (walking, moderate or vigorous). Participants were asked to estimate how many hours they spent outdoors in a typical day in summer, and in a typical day in winter. Responses were given in whole hours from 0 to 24, and participants whose responses exceeded 10 were asked to check and confirm this. An additional option of ‘Less than an hour a day’ was available, and for the present study was assigned a value of 0.5. Overall time outdoors was calculated as the mean of the hours per day in summer and winter together.  Cognitive assessment The format and psychometric properties of the cognitive tests used in UK Biobank have been described by us previously39,52. All tests were administered visually via touchscreen, and scoring was automated. The tasks assessed reasoning (total correct of 13 items), reaction time (mean time in milliseconds to press a button in response to matching cards), numeric memory (longest numeric string recalled in reverse), visuospatial memory (‘pairs matching’ test: total errors when recalling positions of matching cards) and prospective memory (successfully carrying out an instruction after a filled delay). Higher values indicate better performance on the reasoning and numeric memory tests, and worse performance on the reaction time and pairs matching tests. Prospective memory test performance was categorised dichotomously as 1 for a correct response on the first attempt and 0 otherwise. Details of all tests are provided in the Supplementary Methods. The numeric memory test was removed from the UK Biobank baseline assessment battery part-way through recruitment, for reasons of time, resulting in lower sample sizes on this test than on the other four tests.  Change on the cognitive tests was measured by subtracting the baseline score from the follow-up score. Raw scores were used in these calculations, without any replacement of outlying values. Negative change score values on the reasoning test indicate worse performance at follow-up; positive change score values on the reaction time test indicate slower performance at follow-up; positive change score values on the pairs matching test indicate more errors at follow-up.

Data were summarised descriptively to characterise the baseline and follow-up samples. Quintiles were derived for the measures of major road proximity, traffic intensity, noise pollution, physical activity and time outdoors, based on all available data in the whole UK Biobank cohort at baseline. Regression models were used to estimate the association between air pollution exposures (independent variable) and cognitive performance (dependent variable), with and without adjustment for other covariates. The pollutant data provided centrally by UK Biobank were used in all primary analyses, and sensitivity analyses were conducted using the Defra data (see below). Multicollinearity between the air pollution measures and the covariates was within acceptable limits (variance inflation factor values 1.77 to 1.96). For all models, normal-approximation 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated from bootstrapped standard errors (5000 replicates)54. Since there were 25 cross-sectional and 20 follow-up regression analyses, p values (two-tailed) for the pollutant coefficients were adjusted using the Simes-Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method55; both unadjusted and FDR-adjusted p values are reported. Alpha was 0.05 (FDR-adjusted). ‘Do not know’ and ‘Prefer not to answer’ responses were treated as missing. Missing data were not imputed.  For the cross-sectional analyses, each baseline cognitive measure was regressed separately on each air pollution measure (continuous), firstly in unadjusted models and then with adjustment for baseline age, gender, ethnic group, Townsend score (continuous), education, smoking status, physical activity (quintiles), time outdoors (quintiles), major road proximity (quintiles), traffic intensity (quintiles), and population density category. The Supplementary Methods shows a directed acyclic graph of the assumptions underpinning the analytical model: the aim of covariate adjustment was to minimise confounding influences on the association between air pollution exposure and cognitive performance, rather than to construct a multivariable risk prediction model for cognitive outcome.

The assumptions underpinning the analytical model were depicted in a directed acyclic graph, and DAGitty software 2 was used to derive an appropriate covariate adjustment set. DAGitty uses an algorithm to determine whether adjusting for certain covariates will block confounding paths in the graph, based on the directional relationships that are depicted between the nodes in the graph. The algorithm uses the rules of ‘d-separation’ 3 ; it is based solely on the structure of the graph, not on any measured data. Supplementary Figure S1a below shows the variables (nodes) and their putative inter-relationships (arrows) that are assumed to give rise to the predicted association between neighbourhood air pollution exposure and cognitive performance; paths representing potential confounding influences are shown in red. Given these assumptions, the DAGitty algorithm determined a minimum sufficient adjustment set to block these confounding paths (Supplementary Figure S1b; blocked confounding paths shown in black). Ethnic group was not part of the minimum adjustment set, but was included as a covariate in the main analyses in this study because of its inclusion in other key studies in the literature; adding this to the adjustment set did not re-introduce bias according to the graph assumptions (Supplementary Figure S1c: main analysis model). Noise pollution was also added to the covariate adjustment set in supplementary analyses: although the graph structure indicated that confounding paths that included noise pollution should already be blocked following adjustment for deprivation, population density, road proximity, traffic intensity and time outdoors (Supplementary Figure S1c), the addition of noise pollution to the covariate adjustment set (Supplementary Figure S1d) may reduce additional residual confounding. Note that the relationships depicted in the graph are cross-sectional and therefore static, and they do not illustrate the complex time-dependent effects that may be at play. For example, current general health status was assumed in the graph to affect time outdoors and thereby pollution exposure, but pollution exposure (and its antecedents) in the more distant past are likely to have affected general health status over time. Similarly, in some circumstances air pollution levels influence the amount of time that people choose to spend outdoors, and reversing this arrow in the graph would alter the implications for covariate adjustment.

The urban built environment constitutes a major modifiable risk factor of chronic disease (Diez Roux, 2003; Leal and Chaix, 2011; Sallis et al., 2012; Sarkar and Webster, 2017b). Poorly designed residential spaces, for example those associated with reduced salutogenic green-blue exposures have poorer stress-relieving potential, are detrimental to social interactions and have generally been associated with poorer mental health and wellbeing, the effects often modified by neighbourhood level deprivation (Gascon et al., 2015; Mitchell and Popham, 2008). Low land use density and mix, generally synonymous with homogeneous mono-functional residential spaces have been associated with longer trip lengths, poorer street-level physical accessibility to employment centres and service destinations and hence higher private vehicle-miles travelled, and poorer propensity of active travel and physical activity (Frank et al., 2003; Giles-Corti et al., 2012). Neighbourhood walkability measures the activity-promoting potential of the residential built environment and is generally expressed as a composite index of density, diversity, design and destinations (Ewing and Cervero, 2001; Lee and Moudon, 2006). It has been identified as a key determinant of healthy living (Booth et al., 2013; Frank et al., 2003, Frank et al., 2006; Sarkar et al., 2014). Walkable urban design, generally characterized by higher densities of residential, retail and public transport facilities, greater street-level connectivity and proximity to attractive destinations, have been known to promote physical activity through utilitarian walking (Saelens and Handy, 2008), and are associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease (Lovasi et al., 2011; Malambo et al., 2016). Residing in walkable neighbourhoods has been evidenced to be associated with higher levels of physical activity (Rundle et al., 2016; Sallis et al., 2016) and reduced risks of obesity (Creatore et al., 2016; Hirsch et al., 2014), type 2 diabetes (Creatore et al., 2016; Sundquist et al., 2015) and cardio-metabolic disease (Braun et al., 2016; Coffee et al., 2013; Müller-Riemenschneider et al., 2013).""","""Only a few studies have examined the effects of walking behaviour (Murphy et al., 2007), neighbourhood-level built environment (Kaiser et al., 2016) and walkability (Chiu et al., 2016; Howell and Booth, 2016; Loo et al., 2017;Mujahid et al., 2008) upon resting blood pressure and hypertension.""",Yes,Yes,,"""With an estimated one billion worldwide cases, hypertension constitutes the number one health risk factor quantified in terms of disability adjusted life years or DALYs (Murray et al., 2012).

UKBUMP is a spatial database of objectively measured metrics of density, design, destinations, route, and physical environment to quantify health-influencing environmental exposures within multi-scale residential neighbourhoods. In reference to each Biobank participant’s dwelling location, multiple health- and activity-influencing built environment metrics were developed through a series of GIS-based spatial and network analyses performed upon the UK Ordnance Survey spatial database and other national-level datasets. The methodology is detailed elsewhere (Sarkar et al., 2015a). The UKBUMP built environment metrics have been piloted and validated previously (Sarkar et al., 2014) and employed in cardiovascular risk - built environment studies within the UK Biobank (Sarkar et al., 2017).  The present study employed four UKBUMP measures of built environment density, design and destinations developed from the UK-wide Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and Integrated Transport Network spatial data. Densities of housing, retail and public transport were measured as the number of dwelling units (including detached, semi-detached, terraced and self-contained flats), retail outlets and public transport stops within 1-Km street catchment of a participant’s geocoded dwelling and expressed as units/Km2. These were selected given their prior established potential to influence utilitarian walking.  Street-level movement density was modelled from the underlying topology of street network design as the simulated counts of movement through each link in the network, given its relative position and the connectivity with other links within the network. Network analyses were performed on the Ordnance Survey Integrated Transport Network database comprising 5 million street links within a 50 Km radius of each of the UK Biobank assessment centres (Cooper et al., 2012). Movement density was measured from the underlying street configuration, expressed in terms of the graphical metrics of betweenness centrality or through-movement potential within the defined street catchment of UKB participants’ dwelling and acted as proxy of walking density (Sarkar et al., 2015b). Betweenness of any street link x in a graph of N links was expressed as: where:  y and z are the geodesic end points;  Ry is the set of links within a defined street catchment radius from y;  L(y) and L(z) are length of links y and z respectively;  Pz is the proportion of link z within the defined radius  Origin-destination function OD is defined as:  Street network proximity to behaviorally-relevant nearest destinations (schools, medical facilities, leisure, retail and places of worship within the defined network catchment) were also measured in metres from the geocoded dwelling location in ArcGIS Network Analyst and a mean index of destination accessibility was developed for each study participant.  An overall neighbourhood walkability index within 1-Km street catchment was developed for each participant based on the above built environment variables to act as a proxy for individual’s utilitarian walking. The criterion of 1-Km was based on prior research evidence linking built environment, walking and physical activity (Lovasi et al., 2011). Walkability was defined as below: where ‘Residdec’, ‘Retaildec’ and ‘PTdec’ represent the standardized deciles (ranging from 1 to 10 units with higher values indicating higher contribution to overall utilitarian walkability) of densities of residential housing units, retail outlets and public transport in units/Km2 street catchment; ‘Street movementdec’ represent decile of street-level movement density. Given the negative relationship between network distance to destinations and walkability, an inverse relationship was employed with ‘Destinationsdec’ representing deciles of the composite index of distance to nearest behaviourally-relevant destinations. The walkability index derived from the decile scores can have a range between 5 and 50, with higher values indicating higher walkability. To test the sensitivity of the walkability index to multiple spatial scales, we further modelled the component built environment and walkability at 1.5 and 2.0 Km street network catchments. To avoid temporal mismatch to the extent possible, the UKBUMP metrics were modelled towards the end of the baseline phase.  Models additionally adjusted for micro-level physical environment variables of residential greenness and terrain. Exposure to residential greenness was measured with the help of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an objective index of relative overall green vegetation or biomass derived from pixel values of spectral reflectance in remotely sensed data. This was modelled from a series of very high resolution (0.50 cm by 0.50 cm) Bluesky Colour Infrared (CIR) imagery derived from specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Residential greenness acted as a proxy of salutogenic potential and was expressed as mean and standard deviation in the NDVI values within 500-m catchment radius of geocoded UKB participants’ dwellings. The effect of terrain variability was operationalized with the help of a 5 m resolution Bluesky digital terrain model, expressed in terms of variability (standard deviation) in slope in degrees within a 500-m catchment of dwelling. The criterion of 500-m catchment was based on iteration conducted in a previous studies (Sarkar, 2017; Sarkar et al., 2015b) as well as prior literature (Villeneuve et al., 2012; Wolch et al., 2011).""","""The present study employed four UKBUMP measures of built en-vironment density, design and destinations developed from the UK-wide Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and Integrated TransportNetwork spatial data...An overall neighbourhood walkability index within 1-Km streetcatchment was developed for each participant based on the above built environment variables to act as a proxy for individual’s utilitarian walking.""",NA,No,becky it,No predictors,,Yes,Yes,,"""Socio-demographic covariates included age, sex, educational qualifications (coded as a 5-level factor (No qualification, O levels/General Certificate of Secondary Education/Certificate of Secondary Education/General Certificate of Secondary Education/Certificate of Secondary Education, A levels/AS levels, National Vocational Qualification/Higher National Diploma/Higher National Certificate/Other professional qualification, and College or University degree) and employment status coded as (employed; retired; and unemployed, home maker, other).

As per standard definition of hypertension for national surveillance, a prevalent case of hypertension was defined as a participant having systolic blood pressure =140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure =90 mmHg, or self-reported use of antihypertensive medication (Crim et al., 2012). Continuous models of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and binary models of risk of hypertension prevalence were developed. Repeat assessment data on blood pressure to allow correction for regression dilution bias was also available for this study.  2.3. Assessment of exposure Built environment exposure data were sourced from the UK Biobank Urban Morphometric Platform (UKBUMP). UKBUMP is a spatial database of objectively measured metrics of density, design, destinations, route, and physical environment to quantify health-influencing environmental exposures within multi-scale residential neighbourhoods. In reference to each Biobank participant’s dwelling location, multiple health- and activity-influencing built environment metrics were developed through a series of GIS-based spatial and network analyses performed upon the UK Ordnance Survey spatial database and other national-level datasets. The methodology is detailed elsewhere (Sarkar et al., 2015a). The UKBUMP built environment metrics have been piloted and validated previously (Sarkar et al., 2014) and employed in cardiovascular risk - built environment studies within the UK Biobank (Sarkar et al., 2017).  The present study employed four UKBUMP measures of built environment density, design and destinations developed from the UK-wide Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and Integrated Transport Network spatial data. Densities of housing, retail and public transport were measured as the number of dwelling units (including detached, semi-detached, terraced and self-contained flats), retail outlets and public transport stops within 1-Km street catchment of a participant’s geocoded dwelling and expressed as units/Km2. These were selected given their prior established potential to influence utilitarian walking.  Street-level movement density was modelled from the underlying topology of street network design as the simulated counts of movement through each link in the network, given its relative position and the connectivity with other links within the network. Network analyses were performed on the Ordnance Survey Integrated Transport Network database comprising 5 million street links within a 50 Km radius of each of the UK Biobank assessment centres (Cooper et al., 2012). Movement density was measured from the underlying street configuration, expressed in terms of the graphical metrics of betweenness centrality or through-movement potential within the defined street catchment of UKB participants’ dwelling and acted as proxy of walking density (Sarkar et al., 2015b). Betweenness of any street link x in a graph of N links was expressed as: where:  y and z are the geodesic end points;  Ry is the set of links within a defined street catchment radius from y;  L(y) and L(z) are length of links y and z respectively;  Pz is the proportion of link z within the defined radius  Origin-destination function OD is defined as:  Street network proximity to behaviorally-relevant nearest destinations (schools, medical facilities, leisure, retail and places of worship within the defined network catchment) were also measured in metres from the geocoded dwelling location in ArcGIS Network Analyst and a mean index of destination accessibility was developed for each study participant.  An overall neighbourhood walkability index within 1-Km street catchment was developed for each participant based on the above built environment variables to act as a proxy for individual’s utilitarian walking. The criterion of 1-Km was based on prior research evidence linking built environment, walking and physical activity (Lovasi et al., 2011). Walkability was defined as below: where ‘Residdec’, ‘Retaildec’ and ‘PTdec’ represent the standardized deciles (ranging from 1 to 10 units with higher values indicating higher contribution to overall utilitarian walkability) of densities of residential housing units, retail outlets and public transport in units/Km2 street catchment; ‘Street movementdec’ represent decile of street-level movement density. Given the negative relationship between network distance to destinations and walkability, an inverse relationship was employed with ‘Destinationsdec’ representing deciles of the composite index of distance to nearest behaviourally-relevant destinations. The walkability index derived from the decile scores can have a range between 5 and 50, with higher values indicating higher walkability. To test the sensitivity of the walkability index to multiple spatial scales, we further modelled the component built environment and walkability at 1.5 and 2.0 Km street network catchments. To avoid temporal mismatch to the extent possible, the UKBUMP metrics were modelled towards the end of the baseline phase.  Models additionally adjusted for micro-level physical environment variables of residential greenness and terrain. Exposure to residential greenness was measured with the help of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an objective index of relative overall green vegetation or biomass derived from pixel values of spectral reflectance in remotely sensed data. This was modelled from a series of very high resolution (0.50 cm by 0.50 cm) Bluesky Colour Infrared (CIR) imagery derived from specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Residential greenness acted as a proxy of salutogenic potential and was expressed as mean and standard deviation in the NDVI values within 500-m catchment radius of geocoded UKB participants’ dwellings. The effect of terrain variability was operationalized with the help of a 5 m resolution Bluesky digital terrain model, expressed in terms of variability (standard deviation) in slope in degrees within a 500-m catchment of dwelling. The criterion of 500-m catchment was based on iteration conducted in a previous studies (Sarkar, 2017; Sarkar et al., 2015b) as well as prior literature (Villeneuve et al., 2012; Wolch et al., 2011).  2.4.

Statistical analyses To examine the associations with walkability, linear regression models with bootstrapped standard errors were developed for continuous measures of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while modified Poisson procedure (Zou, 2004) with robust estimator was used for prevalence risk ratio of hypertension. The initial modelling exercise involved development of covariate-adjusted single built environment variable (SBEV) models for both continuous and binary outcomes.

Pearson’s correlation coefficients between SBEVs ranged from 0.16 to 0.52. Finally, we examined associations between composite walkability index developed from the statistically significant single built environment predictors and the three outcome variables. Continuous walkability models examined associations per interquartile increment in walkability index while in categorical models, walkability was differentiated by transforming the index into quintiles, with the first quintile acting as a reference. Model 1 controlled for socio-demographic covariates of age, sex, educational qualification and employment status; Model 2 further controlled for lifestyle-level covariates of smoking status, housing tenureship, number in household, car ownership, processed meat intake, obesity as well as neighbourhood deprivation; and fully-adjusted models (Model 3), additionally controlled for physical environment.

Similarly, the results remained robust to covariate adjustments and consistent across spatial scales of functional neighbourhood measurement, limiting to a degree the plausibility of reverse causation. We could perform an analyses of the effects of walkability on the change in blood pressure based on a small subsample with follow-up data. We lacked data on individual residential histories which may have contributed to exposure misclassification, although this was less likely to influence our effect estimates given the high residential stability. Temporal mismatch between the outcome measurements and exposure assessment is another issue, inevitably associated with very large scale cross sectional studies. We did not have exact dates for blood pressure measurements for each participant. The baseline UK Biobank participants were recruited over 2006–2010, while the built environment measures were assessed for the end stage of baseline, to avoid temporal mismatch to the extent possible. Although we extensively adjusted for socio-demographic, lifestyle and environmental covariates, the possibility of residual confounding can’t be excluded as in any observational study. We were not able to adjust for other built environment proxies of stress such as neighbourhood-level aesthetics, incivilities and safety. Taking the cue from biomedical laboratory sciences, future study designs in environmental epidemiological studies must consider the application of negative controls. Such designs, when employed will have the potential to help detect uncontrolled confounding and other potential bias causing spurious causality, especially in large observational studies involving diverse outcomes (Arnold et al., 2016; Lipsitch et al., 2010).

Very few studies have investigated associations between chronic multisite pain (pain occurring at two or more body sites [3]) and mood disorders, although there is some evidence of a positive correlation between number of chronic pain sites and depressive features [4].  A study of the health records of 5 million US Veterans Affairs patients found that those with MDD or BD were 1.8 and 2.6 times more likely, respectively, to have a diagnosis of one or more painful conditions in their health records than non-mood disordered controls [5]. The prevalence of chronic pain was reported to be 23.7% in a meta-analysis of chronic pain in BD studies; and patients with BD were found to be at a two-fold increased risk of having chronic pain compared to the general population [6]. Two further studies investigating the association between chronic pain and BD suggested that pain may be under-recognised among individuals with BD. Cerimele and colleagues have reported that in a cohort of primary care patients receiving an intervention for BD 46% were also receiving treatment for pain or experiencing pain that interfered with their daily functioning [7]. In the Singapore Mental Health Study, chronic pain was the most prevalent comorbid physical condition among participants with BD, affecting 40.4% of these individuals [8]. These initial findings support the need for a better understanding of the relationships between chronic pain and mood disorder in order to improve the clinical management of these challenging to treat conditions.

These diagnostic classifications are summarised below in the “Detailed information of the UK Biobank variables used for classifying lifetime experience of probable bipolar disorder and depression” subsection. In brief, BD included participants who met the criteria for BD type I or type II; MDD included participants who met the criteria for recurrent severe, recurrent moderate or single episode depression; and all other participants who provided complete data comprised the non-mood disordered comparison group, that is they were free of probable MDD and BD according to our criteria. Mood groups were mutually exclusive; participants who met criteria for both BD and MDD were included in the BD group. For ease of reference the term “mood disorder groups” is used throughout the manuscript to refer to the three groups of interest – non-mood disordered comparison group, probable MDD and probable BD. These classifications were based on a lifetime history of manic and depressive symptoms.  Detailed information of the UK Biobank variables used for classifying lifetime experience of probable BD and MDD Criteria for a classification of lifetime experience of probable BD:  1. BD, type I: Ever ‘manic or hyper’ for 2 days OR ever ‘irritable/argumentative’ for 2 days; plus at least 3 features from ‘more active’, ‘more talkative’, ‘needed less sleep’ and ‘more creative/more ideas’; plus duration of a week or more; plus ‘needed treatment or caused problems at work’.  2. BD, type II: Ever ‘manic or hyper’ for 2 days OR ever ‘irritable/argumentative’ for 2 days; plus at least 3 features from ‘more active’, ‘more talkative’, ‘needed less sleep’ and ‘more creative/more ideas’; plus duration of a week or more.  Criteria for a classification of lifetime experience of probable MDD:  1. Single probable episode of MDD: Ever depressed/down for a whole week; plus at least two weeks duration; plus only one episode; plus ever seen a GP or a psychiatrist for ‘nerves, anxiety, depression’ OR ever anhedonic (unenthusiasm/uninterest) for a whole week; plus at least two weeks duration; plus only one episode; plus ever seen a GP or a psychiatrist for ‘nerves, anxiety, depression’.  2.

Classification of chronic and multisite pain At baseline assessment, participants were asked the question “In the last month have you experienced any of the following that interfered with your usual activities?” The response options related to seven specific sites of pain: headache, facial, neck or shoulder, back, stomach or abdominal, hip, and knee pain; and an eighth option of “pain all over the body”. Participants were permitted to select multiple options unless they reported having pain all over the body. Participants who indicated that they had pain were then asked whether the pain at each site had been present for more than 3 months (defined as chronic pain). Individuals were considered to have chronic multisite pain if they reported chronic pain in two body sites or more [3]. The chronic pain categories used for this study were: free of chronic pain; chronic single site pain; chronic pain at 2–3 sites; chronic pain at 4–7 sites; and chronic pain all over the body (widespread pain). Widespread pain was considered as a separate category because a participant who selected ‘pain all over the body’ may differ from one who selected seven individual sites of pain.  Confounding factors We considered sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors and medical comorbidities as important potential confounders of the relationship between chronic pain syndromes and mood disorder. The sociodemographic factors included as covariates were: sex, age (as a continuous variable), ethnic group (defined by UK Biobank as white, black or black British, Asian or Asian British and other (including mixed, Chinese and other ethnic group)), employment status and area-based socioeconomic deprivation. Participants could select more than one option for their current employment status and for this study were categorised into mutually exclusive groups: paid employment/looking after home or family, retired (unless also selected not working due to sickness), unemployed/unpaid, not working due to sickness or disability, and student (if they selected no other category). Area-based socioeconomic status was assessed using the Townsend Index, a score derived from postcode of residence information on unemployment, car ownership, owner occupation and overcrowding [12]. A higher Townsend Index score reflects higher levels of deprivation. The Townsend score was categorised into quintiles based on frequency in this study population: quintile 1 represents the least deprived and quintile 5 the most deprived areas. Lifestyle factors considered as potential confounders included: body mass index (BMI) based on actual weight and height measurements taken at the assessment centre and categorised into: underweight <18.5 kg/m2, normal weight = 18.5-24.9 kg/m2, overweight =25.0-29.9 kg/m2, and obese = 30.0 kg/m2 [13]; smoking status (current, former or never smokers); and frequency of alcohol consumption (daily/almost daily, 3–4 times per week, 1–2 times per week, 1–3 times per month, special occasions only and never). Doctor-diagnosis of cancer was self-reported using the touch screen questionnaire, and details of participants’ other medical conditions were based on self-report during a face to face interview with a trained nurse (UK Biobank field ID 20002). Based on previous work on multimorbidity in large population samples [14], a total of 43 long-term conditions were also classified (see Additional file 1: Table S1 for full details).

Chronic multisite pain commonly co-occurs with mood disorders, particularly BD, even after adjusting for multiple confounders. The risk of a probable mood disorder classification (both MDD and BD) also increased in proportion to the number of sites of chronic pain reported. These findings have implications for our understanding of the neurobiological relationship between chronic pain and mood disorders and, within a clinical context, are relevant because they highlight the importance of an adequate assessment of the nature and extent of pain in patients with BD or MDD. Further work on the UK Biobank cohort will assess whether there are shared genetic and biomarker risk factors for chronic pain and BD/MDD and, as prospective health record linkage data become available, we will assess the impact of pain and mood disorder comorbidity on outcomes for these highly morbid and often challenging clinical groups.""","""Chronic multisite pain commonly co-occurs with mood disorders, particularly BD, even after adjusting for multiple confounders.

Further work on the UK Biobank cohort will assess whether there are shared genetic and biomarker risk factors for chronic pain and BD/ MDD and, as prospective health record linkage data become available, we will assess the impact of pain and mood disorder comorbidity on outcomes for these highly morbid and often challenging clinical groups.""",Yes,Yes,,,"""There is also the potential for recruitment bias as individuals with mood disorder may be less likely to participate if they have pain, or vice versa.""",No,Yes,,No,No,,,,No,No,,,Yes,Yes,,""" UK Biobank was established by the Wellcome Trust medical charity, Medical Research Council, Department of Health, Scottish Government and the Northwest Regional Development Agency.

They often co-occur and long-standing debate has surrounded the temporal nature of the relationship between chronic pain and depression and on the causes and consequences of this relationship [1]. Factors affecting the presentation and management of symptoms are wide-ranging and will involve a combination of demographic, personal, lifestyle, environmental and social elements.  Population-based studies have shown that self-reported musculoskeletal pain is more prevalent among ethnic minority groups in the UK, particularly widespread pain at multiple sites of the body [2–4]. In the US, the prevalence of self-reported pain is higher in Hispanic and Black ethnic groups than non-Hispanic White individuals [5]; however, this difference was not apparent after adjusting for potential confounders such as sociodemographic status, comorbidity, and psychological distress. Minority ethnic groups in US pain clinic populations have also reported more severe or disabling pain than the non-Hispanic White population in the US [6, 7]. Recent studies in the US have focused on trying to better explain the racial and ethnic disparities in pain treatment and management, and suggest that access to healthcare, and patient attitudes and behaviours may play a role in explaining some of the disparities observed [8–10]. Similarly, ethnic minority groups have also been reported to be less likely to seek professional help for mood problems [11] yet the prevalence of depression is reported to be higher in these groups in the UK than in the majority White ethnic group [12, 13].  Few studies have specifically considered the comorbidity of chronic pain and depression across ethnic groups, rather ethnicity has been considered as a covariate in the relationship between pain and depression or as a predictor of pain and depression [14]. In a study of 866 participants, Miller and Cano (2009) found that African Americans were almost twice as likely to have comorbid depression and pain as Caucasian Americans, relative to those with no pain or depression [15]. However, it is unclear whether similar patterns would be observed amongst other ethnic groups and whether the relationship between depression and pain is similar in US and UK ethnic groups.  Chronic pain and depression have also been shown to be some of the most common comorbidities in individuals with other physical and mental long-term conditions [16–18]. Given the ethnic [19, 20] and sociodemographic [16] gradient evident in the pattern of long-term condition reporting it is important to study the relationship between socioeconomic status, ethnicity, pain, and depression independently of other physical long-term conditions, and furthermore understand whether a history of depression or current depressive symptoms are more important. Developing an understanding of these relationships has the potential to impact on how health professionals manage chronic pain in primary care, particularly for ethnic minority groups that may be less likely to present with their low mood problems.""","""Chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression are common, complex disorders that are challenging to treat and manage in primary care.

Indeed, for a patient with COPD, it is important to comply with guidelines for a healthier life style (eg, quit smoking, correct use of medication, and become physically active). Executive functions are evoked for adequate self-management.11 The domain executive functioning is a multifaceted neuropsychological construct, consisting of a set of higher-order neurocognitive processes that contribute to purposeful, goal-directed, and future-oriented behavioral skills, such as organization, planning, problem solving, and reasoning.12 Patients with executive function deficits have difficulties in managing their disease.11 Consequently, cognitive impairments in COPD patients may negatively affect their treatment and in particular the impact of self-management programs.""","""Patients with COPD can have cognitive impairments, either glob-ally or in single cognitive domains.

In the 2011 census, of the 58% of adults who responded to the question ‘how do you usually travel to work? 67% reported private motorised transport as the principal mode of transport, 17.8% public transport, 10.9% walking and 3.1% commuting by bicycle.15  There is increasing evidence of an association between AC and measures of obesity.16 17 In the UK Understanding Society cohort, AC has been shown to be predictive of lower body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage, and a lower adjusted odds of reporting a diabetes diagnosis compared with car users.16 18 Similarly in UK Biobank, AC was significantly and independently associated with lower BMI and body fat percentage.17 The protective effect of AC is likely to be mediated through increased PA, as demonstrated in a UK study that used accelerometry and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to show that walking to work contributed 47.3% of daily MVPA.19  Causal evidence from longitudinal or experimental studies is rare. A longitudinal analysis of the UK Biobank cohort looked at changes in BMI in response to changes in commuting mode over a 4-year follow-up. Individuals who transitioned from car commuting at baseline to active or public transportation modes at follow-up had a decrease in BMI of -0.30 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.47 to –0.13).20  Promoting AC may help to increase population levels of activity; however, there is a need to understand the correlates of AC to develop appropriate interventions.

AC was reported by 5.5% of the sample, of whom less than 1% reported cycling. AC was strongly and consistently associated with higher PA, whether expressed as MVPA or total MET-min/week. In fully adjusted models, AC was associated with an additional 73 min/week of MVPA for men and 105 min/week of MVPA for women, making a substantial contribution to meeting the UK Government recommended levels of 150 min/week MVPA.7 This finding supports previous work by Audrey et al, 19 which found levels of PA to be higher in those who walked to work compared with those who did not. Furthermore the association with MVPA seen in the present study is substantially larger than achieved in a similar population undergoing an intensive PA intervention,8 suggesting that adoption of AC could be an effective intervention for people with T2D.  The importance of sedentary time for both prevention and management of type 2 diabetes has gained research prominence in recent years,31 32 and we found a substantial association between AC and lower sedentary time. In both sexes both AC and public and mixed modes of transport were associated with over an hour less sedentary time per day compared with car use. Since adults with T2DM typically spend less than 3% of the day engaged in MVPA, interventions that focus on reducing sedentary time may be more effective to improve health33; reallocating 30 min of prolonged sedentary time to more active pursuits can improve body composition and cholesterol levels in adults with T2DM.34  The predominant correlate of AC was distance to work, with few people who lived over 1.5 miles from their workplace choosing AC and those living in rural areas less likely to actively commute. Although distance from home to work is not modifiable, AC as the whole or part of the journey could be encouraged by providing more cycleways, by road safety measures to limit traffic speed and improving access to parks and green spaces.35 36 We were unable to examine the association of access to transport as a correlate of AC, but it can be hypothesised this would correlate strongly with the transport method chosen. Furthermore, we used a crude measure of AC (walking or cycling only) and were therefore unable to explore the role of AC as a contributor to the overall journey. Individuals who live beyond 3–6 miles from work are unlikely to solely use AC modes to travel to work and are more likely to combine AC with another form of activity, such as the car or public transport. Therefore the role of AC as a component of the overall journey should be explored in future research.  In the current study, the results for public transport were equivocal with no apparent observations with PA observed. This contrasts with previous research17 and may be due to an inability to differentiate between the different types of public transport taken and the public transport category also including people who reported mixed modes of motorised travel and AC. There are likely to be variations in the energy requirements of different transport modes, which should be examined. It could also be hypothesised that walking or activity behaviours associated with public transport are difficult to recall and record in the IPAQ. However, in previous research public transport has been shown to contribute to PA and therefore warrants further investigation.  The final aim of the study was to explore the social and environmental correlates of AC behaviour. Those who lived in a rural area were less likely to use active modes of commuting, but no other environmental variables, such as traffic density, were shown to be associated. This may be due to an overall lack of variation in the environmental variables and suggests a more diverse sample may be required. For example, there is a lack of interindividual variation in the measure of air pollution, which may explain the lack of association seen""","""A substantial majority (80%) of adults with T2DM reported commuting by car.

Socks and shoes were removed and height was measured using the Seca 202 height measure (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Weight and estimated percentage fat were measured with the Tanita BC418ma bioimpedance device (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan).

Physical activity assessment Questions on the touchscreen about walking, moderate physical activity and vigorous physical activity, which were similar to those used in the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire,11 were used to estimate excess metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours/week of physical activity during work and leisure time. For each of the three activity categories (walking, moderate physical activity and vigorous physical activity), participants were asked how many days in a typical week they did each of the activities for 10 min or more (for walking: touchscreen question number WP1, UK Biobank variable n_864_0_0; for moderate physical activity: touchscreen question number WP2, UK Biobank variable n_884_0_0; and for vigorous physical activity: touchscreen question number WP3, UK Biobank variable n_904_0_0). For each category, participants who entered one or more days were then asked how many minutes they spent doing those activities on a typical day (for walking: WP1A, n_874_0_0; for moderate physical activity: WP2A, n_894_0_0; and for vigorous physical activity: WP3A, n_914_0_0). For each activity category, the number of reported days was multiplied by the number of reported minutes on a typical day to generate duration of activity in minutes per week.  Activity on a typical day of <10 min was recoded to 0 for any of the three categories of activity. For each of the three categories of activity, values of >1260 min per week (equivalent to an average of 3 hours per day) were truncated at 1260.11  Total MET values for each category from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form were: 3.3 for walking, 4.0 for moderate physical activity and 8.0 for vigorous physical activity.11 We report excess METs, which are calculated by subtracting one MET from the value for each activity, and represent the energy expenditure above that of an inactive person.12 Excess MET values were therefore 2.3 for walking, 3.0 for moderate physical activity and 7.0 for vigorous physical activity. Excess MET-hours per week were calculated by multiplying the excess MET value for each activity by the duration of activity in hours per week.11....Multiple linear regression was used to calculate the mean body fat percentage in single units of BMI (eg, 17.00–17.99, 18.00–18.99, 19.00–19.99 kg/m2, etc), adjusted for age (5-year categories: <45, 45–49.99, 50–54.99, 55–59.99, 60–64.99 and =65.00 years).

Alternatively, positive associations between hearing aid use and cognition may be accounted for by more cognitively able people seeking and using hearing aids.

No effect estimates.",Yes,Yes,,"""The prevalence of dementia in those aged over 60 years is between 5–7%, with the numbers of those affected globally forecast to double every 20 years between 2010 and 2050 [1]. Cognitive decline and dementia have a profound impact on the individual, on caregivers and society, and the financial costs of cognitive decline and dementia are a major source of concern [2]. However, there is some cause for optimism in the form of potentially modifiable risk and protective factors, including cardiovascular health, psychological and emotional health, cognitive and physical activity, smoking and diet [3,4], and these may offer avenues for prevention. In this study we suggest that remediation and/or prevention of hearing loss may offer an additional avenue for prevention.  Hearing loss is common in older adults [5] and is associated with cognitive decline and incident dementia [6–11]. There are two main explanatory hypotheses for this association. The first is that the association between cognitive and hearing variables reflects a ‘common cause’, namely age-related changes in the nervous system. In this model, hearing loss and cognitive decline share common, age-related neurodegenerative mechanisms [8,11]. The second is the ‘cascade’ hypothesis, where long-term deprivation of auditory input may impact on cognition either directly, through impoverished input, or via effects of hearing loss on social isolation and depression [6,12,13]. Hearing loss is independently associated with social isolation and depression [14,15], and social isolation and depression are associated with cognitive decline [3,16,17]. One further possibility is that hearing impairment results in increased compensatory mental effort to perform cognitive tasks (such as remembering sequences of spoken digits [18]). This compensatory effort may use up limited cognitive resources resulting in an apparent decrement in cognition (the ‘cognitive load’ hypothesis [11]). However, this hypothesis seems unlikely to fully account for the association between hearing and cognitive performance given that the association between hearing and cognition remains similar whether cognition is tested with visual or auditory stimuli [10].  There is evidence that intervention in the form of hearing aids may improve quality of life and increase social engagement [19] and inconsistent evidence that hearing aid use may have a positive impact on performance of cognitive measures over a few weeks or months [20]. Some of the cognitive measures in these previous studies were auditory-based, so improvements may be due to improved audibility. In terms of longer-term outcomes of hearing aid use on cognition, Valentijn and colleagues [21] found no impact of sensory intervention (cataract surgery; n = 22 or hearing aids; n = 7) on cognitive measures 6 years after baseline.

Structural equation modelling allows statistical evaluation of inter-relationships (pathways) between hearing impairment, cognition, hearing aid use, social isolation and depression while simultaneously controlling for the potential confounders of age, sex, general health and socioeconomic status. Structural equation modelling is a regression-based technique that requires data to be distributed along the range of variables (e.g. both hearing aid use and non-use, good to poor hearing). We considered mediation to be present when both the pathways constituting the indirect effect are statistically significant, and that this is partial mediation if the direct effect is also significant.

Conclusions Grip strength is significantly associated with cognitive functioning in the general population and individuals with schizophrenia, particularly for working memory and processing speed.

Thus, there is a growing interest in how this brief, functional task can capture several important domains.  However, the research to date has only established these relationships in older adults, and the generalizability to other populations is unknown. In particular, there is an absence of research examining the relationships between muscular strength and health outcomes in psychiatric populations. Nonetheless, research in the general population has shown that association between muscular strength and health extends beyond physical functioning, to also include brain health. For instance, elderly adults with greater muscular strength in the upper and lower limbs have increased cognitive capacities and are at lower risk of developing age-related cognitive impairment.7,8 Importantly, the relationship persists even when controlling for other putative factors such as age, adiposity, and physical activity..7,8 Indeed, handgrip strength is positively correlated with performance across multiple cognitive domains in aging samples, including verbal and spatial abilities, processing speed, and memory.9,10 Indeed, a recent systematic review of 15 longitudinal studies found that the consistent predictive relationships between grip strength and cognition indicated that decrements in grip strength can provide a clinically useful marker of overall cognitive decline.11  Despite the consistency and strength of the associations observed between grip strength and cognition in older adults, the neurophysiological underpinnings of this relationship are currently unclear. Although greater total brain volume is associated with larger muscle size, the relationships between total brain volume and muscular strength are inconsistent.12 Nonetheless, studies have linked muscular strength with white matter regions of the brain,12 particularly in showing that individuals with greater grip strength have significantly fewer signs of aging-related white matter degradation, identified by “white matter hyperintensities” (WMH).10,13 As WMHs can impede performance across a broad spectrum of both physical and mental tasks,14 this may explain part of the relationship between grip and cognition.  However, recent studies have shown that the correlation between decreases in handgrip and cognition which consistently occur overtime cannot be accounted for white matter degradation alone.10 Another mechanism through which grip may relate to cognition in older adults is through a shared link to inflammation, as both aging-related cognitive decline and weakened grip are predicted by heightened levels of inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6.15,16  Although there is a growing body of literature in relation to handgrip strength and cognition in aging populations, no studies have yet examined the associations between handgrip strength and cognition among individuals with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is associated cognitive deficits across a broad range of neurocognitive domains, including processing speed, short and long memory, and reasoning.17,18 These deficits predate the onset of illness and persist over time despite antipsychotic treatment.19,20 They are highly predictive of the long-term functional disability often observed in people with schizophrenia,21 and may impede psychosocial recovery to an even greater extent than positive psychotic symptoms.22,23 However, it remains unclear if the cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia are associated with reduced muscular strength.""","""Large cohort studies have shown that weak grip strength is associated with poor health-related quality of life,3 and can be used to identify individuals at risk of mobility limitations, fracture, frailty, and falls risk.4,5""",Yes,Yes,,"""Although there is a growing body of literature in relation to handgrip strength and cognition in aging populations, no studies have yet examined the associations between handgrip strength and cognition among individuals with schizophrenia.

Given that the treatments have been shown in randomized trials to be effective at CVD risk reduction, our classification of these risks as high is somewhat conservative. In CPRD, nonrecording of risk factors by general practitioners is not at random (rather likely reflecting the absence of clinical symptoms, signs, and low clinical suspicion), making multiple imputation of missing data inappropriate. We took the prudent approach of assigning those with missing values to the low CRS group and showed comparable associations between the CRS and all-cause mortality in those with and without missing data. Both of these approaches are conservative, that is, in UKB perhaps including some individuals on treatment as high risk when their true risk level was reduced and in CPRD possibly including some individuals with no data on risks recorded as not having low risks when they actually had CVD risk factors: The combined effects of these conservative approaches may have led to underestimation of true effect sizes.  In addition, in CPRD, for cholesterol and glucose measurements, a long lead-in period of up to 8.5 years were defined, with the support from clinicians, on the basis of the available data for building a cohort. This presents the possibility that people with a normal blood test value might develop the condition of interest (eg, high cholesterol and fasting glucose) and thus be misclassified. However, this misclassification will bias results toward the null and is unlikely to have influenced the direction of our results. In the CPRD primary care records, people with CVD risk factors may have been seen by primary care during follow-up more often, with better ascertainment of outcomes. However, our ascertainment of outcomes in both studies included hospital admission records and death certificates, so at least for the more severe health events, ascertainment of outcomes was likely unbiased. Also, we highlight that the inclusion of hypertension and diabetes as components of the Rockwood frailty index contribute to a higher frailty score for those with higher CRS. However, as this influence is constant for frailty estimates over time (at index date as well as throughout the follow-up period), expectation is that the effect is minimized for the analysis of frailty progression over time.  Some of the risk factor measures may reflect elements of subclinical pathology, perhaps from early life exposures that may not be amenable to intervention. However, there are many clinical trials of, for example, blood pressure and cholesterol reduction in middle age or later life that have reported large reductions in CVD risk and mortality (34,35), suggesting that risks even in midlife and later life are susceptible to change. Clearly, only randomized trials of comprehensive risk reduction for improving aging outcomes could provide definitive data, and such studies should be given high priority.  Future work should seek to study this question with a more complete set of measured risk factors. Future analyses could also separate the CRS into behavioral risk factors (eg, smoking and physical activity) and more proximal cardiovascular risk factors to tease out the effects of overlapping risk factors. Studies of inherited genetic risks could help provide unconfounded estimates for lifelong exposure to many of the studied risk factors. Interestingly, our recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of parental longevity (36) in UK Biobank found strong associations with lower genetic risks scores for several cardiovascular traits, including CVD, adverse lipid levels, and blood pressure. Our GWAS also identified a variant linked to smoking was associated with father’s survival. This suggests that genetic propensity to several of the cardiovascular risk factors used here in the CRS is associated with mortality and hence morbidity and that the CVD risk factor associations reported are likely to be causal""","""In UKB, measured cholesterol and glucose levels were not available, so we used proxy markers such as diagnoses of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes, or related treatment receipt to classify risk factor...We took the prudent approach of assigning those with missing values to the low CRS group and showed comparable associations between the CRS and all-cause mortality in those with and without missing data""",Partially,Yes,,"Discuss direction but not magnitude of how much the effect sizes may be underestimated ""In UKB, measured cholesterol and glucose levels were not available, so we used proxy markers such as diagnoses of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes, or related treatment receipt to classify risk factor status.

Associations of walking pace with mortality were modified by BMI. In women, the hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality in slow compared with fast walkers were 2.16 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.68–2.77] and 1.31 (1.08–1.60) in the bottom and top BMI tertiles, respectively; corresponding HRs for men were 2.01 (1.68–2.41) and 1.41 (1.20–1.66). Hazard ratios for cardiovascular mortality remained above 1.7 across all categories of BMI in men and women, with modest heterogeneity in men. Handgrip strength was associated with cardiovascular mortality in men only (HR tertile 1 vs. tertile 3 = 1.38; 1.18–1.62), without differences across BMI categories, while associations with all-cause mortality were only seen in men with low BMI.

Studies have found an association between objectively assessed walking pace and mortality, mostly in older adult,5–7 with other studies suggesting self-reported walking pace may act as an important marker of cardiovascular health.8,9 Thus, self-reported walking pace could function as a pragmatic measure of physical fitness and a simple index of mortality risk. However, in order to have clinical and public health relevance, research is needed to examine the extent to which pragmatic self-reported measures of walking pace are associated with cardiorespiratory fitness and whether the associations with all-cause and cause-specific mortality are maintained after adjustment for potential confounding variables or vary across potential effect modifiers such as age, smoking status, or body mass index (BMI).  Muscle strength is also an important and reproducible measure of physical fitness and has been associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.2 Handgrip strength is correlated with overall muscle strength and is associated with functional and health outcomes including frailty, falls, nutritional status and mortality.10–15 Investigating whether associations persist after adjustment for other pragmatic measures of physical fitness, such as walking pace, and maintained across potential effect modifiers will further help elucidate the potential clinical importance of handgrip strength within the general population.""","""Studies have found an association between objectively assessed walking pace and mortality, mostly in older adult,5–7 with other studies suggesting self-reported walking pace may act as an important marker of cardiovascular health...Handgrip strength is correlated with overall muscle strength and is associated with functional and health outcomes including frailty, falls, nutritional status and mortality""",Yes,Yes,,"""Investigating whether associations persist after adjustment for other pragmatic measures of physical fitness, such as walking pace, and maintained across potential effect modifiers will further help elucidate the potential clinical importance of handgrip strength within the general population.""","""research is needed to examine the extent to which pragmatic self-reported measures of walking pace are associated with cardiorespiratory fitness and whether the associations with allcause and cause-specific mortality are maintained after adjustment for potential confounding variables or vary across potential effect modifiers such as age, smoking status, or body mass index (BMI)...Investigating whether associations persist after adjustment for other pragmatic measures of physical fitness, such as walking pace, and maintained across potential effect modifiers will further help elucidate the potential clinical importance of handgrip strength within the general population","""The aim of this analysis was to quantify the associations of self-reported walking pace and handgrip strength with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in men and women from UK Biobank and to investigate whether associations are maintained across categories of age, BMI, and smoking status.""","""The aim of this analysis was to quantify the associations of selfreported walking pace and handgrip strength with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in men and women from UK Biobank and to investigate whether associations are maintained across categories of age, BMI, and smoking status""",Yes,Yes,,Methods start on page 2,"""UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort of middle-aged adults designed to support biomedical analysis focused on improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic disease.""",Yes,Yes,check it,Yes,Yes,,"""UK Biobank This analysis used data from 502 639 participants within UK Biobank, the methods and aim of which have been reported elsewhere.16 In brief, UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort of middle-aged adults designed to support biomedical analysis focused on improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic disease.

However, this “risk paradox” is partly explained by smoking and disease-associated weight loss. This paradox may also arise from BMI failing to measure fat redistribution to a centralized position in later life.  Objective: This study aimed to estimate associations between combined measurements of BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) with mortality and incident coronary artery disease (CAD).  Design: This study followed 130,473 UK Biobank participants aged 60–69 y (baseline 2006–2010) for =8.3 y (n = 2974 deaths). Current smokers and individuals with recent or disease-associated (e.g., from dementia, heart failure, or cancer) weight loss were excluded, yielding a “healthier agers” group.

However, among normal-weight subjects, mortality increased for those with a higher WHR (HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.65) compared with a lower WHR.

Conclusions: For healthier agers (i.e., nonsmokers without disease-associated weight loss), having central adiposity and a BMI corresponding to normal weight or overweight is associated with substantial excess mortality.

Younger and middle-aged adults classified as overweight or class I obese (BMI: 30 to <35) have substantially increased risks for mortality relative to normal-weight individuals (BMI: 18.5 to <25) (2, 3). However, paradoxical associations for persons within the overweight and class I obese BMI categories have been reported for those aged =65 y; several meta-analyses and cohort studies show that persons with BMI-defined overweight have mortality risks that are reduced (4, 5) or similar (6–8) to individuals with a normal BMI. Some researchers claim that this paradox may reflect a protective physiologic effect of a slightly higher BMI (9) and challenge the idea that conventional BMI thresholds should be used in older persons (6, 9–11), arguing that this paradox justifies a revision of the current scientific consensus on the health dangers of being overweight. Others have claimed that public health researchers “would rather not talk about” studies that show that being overweight does not always shorten life (12). Our recent analysis of 955,000 population-representative primary care patients showed that paradoxical overweight and moderate-obesity mortality risks for adults aged 60–84 y were partly explained by confounding from inclusion of smokers and subjects with disease-associated weight loss (13). We found that in “healthier agers” (nonsmokers without disease-associated weight loss), class I obesity was associated with excess mortality and coronary artery disease (CAD) (13); that is, the obesity risk paradox reversed to being nonparadoxical. A further possible bias in the paradoxical associations for BMI-defined overweight (and class I obese) persons may be that BMI does not distinguish between fat and fat-free mass (6, 14). This limitation of BMI may be accentuated in older age groups; after 60 y, fat-free mass decreases and fat mass is redistributed (15, 16) to a more central deposition. Weight loss attributable to the depletion of skeletal mass and height loss during aging may reduce the accuracy of BMI in later life (14).

We excluded participants whose death dates were not reported (n = 1). We excluded the first 2 y of follow-up (n = 677) to reduce the effects of reverse causation, whereby underlying diseases are associated with a lower BMI and an increased risk of death.

Stokes and Preston (28) reported that estimates using baseline BMI may underestimate the association between obesity and mortality, because BMI fluctuations throughout life are not captured; model performance was improved through the use of a person’s maximum attained BMI. Unfortunately, the UK Biobank did not collect data on weight history throughout the life course, so the results from our available BMI data may be underestimates of true effect sizes. Our follow-up period of =8.3 y is comparable to other studies, but longer follow-ups may be more informative. Relatively few participants in our class I obese sample had a lower WHR, although many participants in our normal BMI category had intermediate or higher WHRs.""","""our risk estimates may be inflated relative to the overall population, owing to fewer competing risk factors (26)...""the results from our available BMI data may be underestimates of true effect sizes""","""In conclusion, in our large sample of 60- to 69-y-old nonsmokers without prior weight loss (or related disease), risk estimation models for mortality combining BMI and WHR were substantially more informative than models with only BMI measurements. The reported BMI-based overweight risk paradox in later life appears to be attributable in part to central adiposity, which is not measured by BMI. Healthier agers (i.e., nonsmokers without weight loss) with higher central adiposity who are in the overweight BMI category have substantial excess mortality and heart disease risk. We also found no evidence of a risk paradox with moderate obesity, but we instead saw overall increases in mortality compared with individuals with a normal BMI and lower WHR. Higher levels of physical activity were an independent protective factor, but we did not find that these negated the effects of overweight or class I obesity. Overall, our findings do not support acceptance of the overweight risk paradox as a real protective physiologic effect in the studied older group.""","""in our large sample of 60- to 69-y-old nonsmokers without prior weight loss (or related disease), risk estimation models for mortality combining BMI and WHR were substantially more informative than models with only BMI measurements.

According to the WHO’s Global Burden of Disease study, dietary risks and high body weight are two of the top three contributors to the number of years suffered with disability and morbidity in the UK [1]. Food-related ill health in the UK, driven by unhealthy diet, contributes to 10% of the combined mortality and morbidity burden [2]. Processed meat consumption, in particular, is associated with higher incidence of type-2 diabetes, coronary heart disease [3,4,5], and certain cancers [6].  Social inequalities in diet and obesity are established across markers of socioeconomic position (SEP) such as education, income (including household income [7]) and occupation [8], and may be contributing to recognised inequalities in NCD risk [9, 10]. Explanations include having less knowledge about healthy eating and fewer cooking skills [11, 12], and less time for cooking at home among socially disadvantaged groups [13]. Low-income groups, in particular, are also more price-sensitive [14], spending less on food overall and per calorie than other social groups [15].  In addition to individual-level socioeconomic determinants, neighbourhood food environments are also potentially important influences on diet and weight [16, 17], although the research evidence remains equivocal [18, 19]. Neighbourhoods where the mix of food retailing is biased towards a high proportion of fast-food outlets may be especially influential [20,21,22] – where fast-food might be perceived as the easier choice and therefore used more, and where greater fast-food access is not simply a function of greater access to all types of food outlet [23]. As a result, recent studies have increasingly situated fast-food access within the wider context of overall neighbourhood food retailing through adopting relative as opposed to absolute measures of exposure [24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. Easier access to fast-food outlets may facilitate the consumption of energy dense, nutrient poor fast foods [31, 32], which have been linked prospectively to excess weight gain [33], and associated with other cardio-metabolic risk factors [34]. Despite some fast-food outlets selling ‘healthier’ foods than others, at a population level, visits to and use of fast-food outlets has been linked to weight gain over time [35], and consumption of a less healthy diet and greater odds of obesity [36], respectively.  Fast-food access may also contribute to established social inequalities in fast-food consumption and weight [37]. Deprived neighbourhoods have generally greater numbers of fast-food outlets [16, 38], and there is evidence that the influence of neighbourhood environments vary by educational attainment as a marker of SEP [39]. However, there has been little research on the interaction between fast-food access and household income, which may hold implications for diet and weight via different mechanisms. Low-income consumers, in particular, may be disproportionately affected by the presence of fast-food outlets [14], which serve large portions of energy-dense, calorific foods at low prices [40].  With mounting evidence of the adverse influence of fast-food outlets on health and the abundance of fast-food outlets in deprived areas, the proliferation of these outlets has become a public health concern. Policies are now in place in many regions of the UK to stem growth in this retail sector [41], while in the US, a moratorium was placed on the opening of new fast-food outlets in South Los Angeles, for example [42]. At the same time, more empirical research is needed to better understand the magnitude of influence of fast-food outlets on health and their contribution to social inequalities.""","""In addition to individual-level socioeconomic determinants, neighbourhood food environments are also potentially important influences on diet and weight [16, 17], although the research evidence remains equivocal [18, 19].""",Yes,Yes,,"""At the same time, more empirical research is needed to better understand the magnitude of influence of fast-food outlets on health and their contribution to social inequalities.""","""There has been little research on the interaction between fast-food access and household income, which may hold implications for diet and weight via different mechanisms.""","""Using a large sample from the UK Biobank, the aim of this study was to establish the independent and combined associations (including interactions) of each of neighbourhood fast-food access and household income, with processed meat consumption and multiple measures of adiposity.""","""Low-income consumers, in particular, may be disproportionately affected by the presence of fast-food outlets [14], which serve large portions of energy-dense, calorific foods at low prices [40]....Using a large sample from the UK Biobank, the aim of this study was to establish the independent and combined associations (including interactions) of each of neighbourhood fast-food access and household income, with processed meat consumption and multiple measures of adiposity.""",Yes,Yes,,Methods on page 2,"""UK Biobank is a cross-sectional, observational cohort study, which recruited 502,656 people between 2006 and 2010.

A large body of evidence has shown that greater levels of physical activity are associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer (WCRF-AICR, 2011; Moore et al, 2016). However, colorectal cancers are a heterogeneous collection of tumours with variable molecular characteristics, and it is hypothesised that tumours located at different anatomical subsites may have distinct aetiological risk factors (Wei et al, 2004; Limsui et al, 2010). For physical activity, generally consistent inverse relationships have been found for colon and rectal cancers, with a recent participant-level pooled analysis, which included 1.44 million participants, reporting that leisure-time physical activity was associated with lower risks of colon cancer and rectal cancer when analysed separately (Moore et al, 2016). It is unclear, however, how physical activity levels are related to colon cancer risk across the proximal and distal anatomical regions as few studies have been of sufficient size to undertake analyses by subsite, and inconsistent results have emerged. For instance, in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), an inverse relationship was reported only between total physical activity and proximal colon cancer risk, but null results were found for distal colon cancer risk (Friedenreich et al, 2006). In contrast, in other large prospective studies, inverse relationships of similar magnitude have been observed across the colonic subsites (Howard et al, 2008; Burón Pust et al, 2017; Wei et al, 2017).  Sedentary behaviours, defined as sitting or reclined posture activities which expend <U+2A7D>1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) (Owen et al, 2000), may also influence colorectal cancer risk. In the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP Diet and Health Study, sedentary behaviour (time spent watching television and videos) was associated with a greater colorectal cancer risk (Howard et al, 2008). A meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies reported that total sitting time, television viewing time, and occupational sitting time were all positively associated with colon cancer development (Schmid and Leitzmann, 2014).

Questions are listed in Supplementary Table 1 and are available to view on the UK Biobank Web site (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/label.cgi?id=100054). The questions captured the frequency and duration of three different levels of activity (walking, moderate, and vigorous). Participants were asked on how many days in a typical week they engaged in each activity level for 10 min or more. For each level in which an answer of one or more days was given, the participant was then asked how many minutes they usually spent doing that activity on a typical day. Using this information, METs were used to quantify the intensity of physical activity. The MET values represent the ratio of energy expended per kilogram of body weight per hour to the standard resting metabolic rate (Ainsworth et al, 2011). The number of days per week that participants engaged in each level of physical activity was multiplied by the number of minutes spent per day doing that activity. This gave the total number of minutes spent per week engaged in each activity category. Total MET values for each category from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form were: 3.3 for walking, 4.0 for moderate physical activity and 8.0 for vigorous physical activity (IPAQ Research Committee, 2005). We report excess METs, which are calculated by subtracting one MET from the value for each activity, and represent the energy expenditure above that of an inactive person (Howley, 2001). Excess MET values were therefore 2.3 for walking, 3.0 for moderate physical activity and 7.0 for vigorous physical activity.

All discretionary screen-time exposures were significantly associated with all health outcomes. The associations of overall discretionary screen time with all-cause mortality and incidence of CVD and cancer were strongest amongst participants in the lowest tertile for grip strength (all-cause mortality hazard ratio per 2-h increase in screen time (1.31 [95% confidence interval: 1.22–1.43], p < 0.0001; CVD 1.21 [1.13–1.30], p = 0.0001; cancer incidence 1.14 [1.10–1.19], p < 0.0001) and weakest amongst those in the highest grip-strength tertile (all-cause mortality 1.04 [0.95–1.14], p = 0.198; CVD 1.05 [0.99–1.11], p = 0.070; cancer 0.98 [0.93–1.05], p = 0.771).

Conclusions The associations between discretionary screen time and adverse health outcomes were strongest in those with low grip strength, fitness and physical activity and markedly attenuated in those with the highest levels of grip strength, fitness and physical activity.

There is also strong evidence that low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness [5] and muscular strength [6,7,8,9] are associated with similar adverse health outcomes. It has been suggested that the associations of physical activity and sedentary behaviour with health outcomes are largely independent [1, 2, 10]. However, a recent meta-analysis indicated that the adverse effects of sitting time and television (TV) viewing on mortality were not observed in individuals with high levels of physical activity [10]. This observation indicates that the risks associated with sedentary behaviour are not ubiquitous, since individuals with low physical activity experience the greatest adverse effects. Using data from UK Biobank, which includes almost 500,000 participants with data on grip strength and over 60,000 participants with data on cardiorespiratory fitness, we recently reported that the adverse association of low levels of physical activity with mortality and CVD events are substantially stronger in individuals with low levels of grip strength and/or cardiorespiratory fitness. This impies that the benefits of physical activity may be greatest amongst individuals with lower levels of functional capacity, but relatively modest in those with already high levels of functional capacity, who were at low risk irrespective of physical activity levels [9]. This has implications for public health guidance, as it suggests that specifically targeting those with low fitness and strength to increase their physical activity levels may be an effective approach to reduce population risk [9].

Participants were excluded from the analyses if they recorded implausible values, that is, if the sum of their total physical activity, sleeping time and total screen time exceeded 24 h (n = 705 participants were excluded) [9].  Grip strength was assessed using a Jamar J00105 hydraulic hand dynamometer and the mean of three measurements for each hand were used. Grip strength was measured in kilograms. Fitness test data were introduced into UK Biobank from August 2009, so these data are available only in a subgroup of 74,836 participants. In these individuals, cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using a sub-maximal 6-min incremental ramp cycle ergometer test with workload calculated according to age, height, weight, resting heart rate and sex, and heart rate monitored via a four-lead electrocardiogram, as previously reported, with the aim of achieving a final work rate of 50% of predicted maximal power [9]. Tests were terminated if heart rate exceeded 75% of the age-predicted maximum. In individuals with systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 109 mmHg or who answered ‘yes’ or ‘unsure’ to the question ‘Has a doctor ever said that you have a heart condition and should only do physical activity recommended by a doctor’, the test protocol was modified to achieve a final work rate of 35% of predicted maximal power (n = 8932). Fitness was not measured in individuals who were not able to walk or cycle unaided for 10 min, were pregnant or had high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure =180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure =110 mmHg) (n = 358) or if the equipment failed (n = 643). The work rate at maximal heart rate was estimated by extrapolating the pre-exercise heart rate (i.e. at work rate zero watts) and the heart rate and work rate at the end of the test to the age-predicted maximal heart rate (208 – 0.7 × age) [18] assuming a linear relationship [19]. The linear nature of the work rate vs heart rate relationship means that the estimated maximal work rate for an individual should be independent of the work rate achieved during the exercise test. Maximal oxygen uptake (i.e. at maximal heart rate) was estimated from the regression equation for the relationship between work rate and oxygen uptake (oxygen uptake (in ml.kg- 1.min- 1) = 7 + (10.8 × work rate (in watts))/body mass (in kilograms)) [20] and then expressed in terms of maximal MET (where 1 MET = 3.5 ml.kg- 1.min- 1).  Dietary information was collected via a self-reported dietary questionnaire (Oxford WebQ) [21, 22]. Participants were asked how many portions of specified foods they generally ate. Subjective sleep duration was obtained by asking: ‘About how many hours sleep do you get in every 24 hours?’ Based on the answer, we derived a categorical sleep duration variable (short sleeper <7 h.day- 1, normal sleeper 7–9 h.day- 1 or long sleeper >9 h.day- 1). Area-based socioeconomic status was derived from postcode of residence using the Townsend score, which is derived from census data on housing, employment, social class and car availability [23]. Other socio-demographic information such as employment (paid employment, retired, unable to work, unemployed, student and other), professional qualifications (college or university, A or O levels, GCSE, CSEs or equivalent levels) and income (<£18,000, £18,000–29,999, £30,000–51,999, £52,000–100,000 and >£100,000) were self-reported at baseline. Age was calculated from dates of birth and baseline assessment. Ethnicity was self-reported and smoking status was categorised into never, former and current smoking. Medical history (physician diagnosis of long-standing illness, depression, stroke, angina, myocardial infarction, hypertension, cancer and diabetes) and medication history (for diabetes, cholesterol and hypertension) were collected from the self-completed baseline assessment questionnaire. Height, body weight and waist circumference were measured by trained nurses during the baseline assessment. Body composition (percentage body fat) was measured using standardised bio-impedance protocols. BMI was calculated as (weight/height2) and the World Health Organization criteria [24] were used to classify BMI into underweight <18.5, normal weight 18.5–24.9, overweight 25.0–29.9 and obese =30.0 kg.m- 2. Central obesity was defined as waist circumference >88 cm for women and >102 cm for men.

Fitness test data were introduced into UK Biobank from August 2009, so these data are available only in a subgroup of 74,836 participants. In these individuals, cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using a sub-maximal 6-min incremental ramp cycle ergometer test with workload calculated according to age, height, weight, resting heart rate and sex, and heart rate monitored via a four-lead electrocardiogram, as previously reported, with the aim of achieving a final work rate of 50% of predicted maximal power [9]. Tests were terminated if heart rate exceeded 75% of the age-predicted maximum. In individuals with systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 109 mmHg or who answered ‘yes’ or ‘unsure’ to the question ‘Has a doctor ever said that you have a heart condition and should only do physical activity recommended by a doctor’, the test protocol was modified to achieve a final work rate of 35% of predicted maximal power (n = 8932). Fitness was not measured in individuals who were not able to walk or cycle unaided for 10 min, were pregnant or had high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure =180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure =110 mmHg) (n = 358) or if the equipment failed (n = 643). The work rate at maximal heart rate was estimated by extrapolating the pre-exercise heart rate (i.e. at work rate zero watts) and the heart rate and work rate at the end of the test to the age-predicted maximal heart rate (208 – 0.7 × age) [18] assuming a linear relationship [19]. The linear nature of the work rate vs heart rate relationship means that the estimated maximal work rate for an individual should be independent of the work rate achieved during the exercise test. Maximal oxygen uptake (i.e. at maximal heart rate) was estimated from the regression equation for the relationship between work rate and oxygen uptake (oxygen uptake (in ml.kg- 1.min- 1) = 7 + (10.8 × work rate (in watts))/body mass (in kilograms)) [20] and then expressed in terms of maximal MET (where 1 MET = 3.5 ml.kg- 1.min- 1).  Dietary information was collected via a self-reported dietary questionnaire (Oxford WebQ) [21, 22]. Participants were asked how many portions of specified foods they generally ate. Subjective sleep duration was obtained by asking: ‘About how many hours sleep do you get in every 24 hours?’ Based on the answer, we derived a categorical sleep duration variable (short sleeper <7 h.day- 1, normal sleeper 7–9 h.day- 1 or long sleeper >9 h.day- 1). Area-based socioeconomic status was derived from postcode of residence using the Townsend score, which is derived from census data on housing, employment, social class and car availability [23]. Other socio-demographic information such as employment (paid employment, retired, unable to work, unemployed, student and other), professional qualifications (college or university, A or O levels, GCSE, CSEs or equivalent levels) and income (<£18,000, £18,000–29,999, £30,000–51,999, £52,000–100,000 and >£100,000) were self-reported at baseline. Age was calculated from dates of birth and baseline assessment. Ethnicity was self-reported and smoking status was categorised into never, former and current smoking. Medical history (physician diagnosis of long-standing illness, depression, stroke, angina, myocardial infarction, hypertension, cancer and diabetes) and medication history (for diabetes, cholesterol and hypertension) were collected from the self-completed baseline assessment questionnaire. Height, body weight and waist circumference were measured by trained nurses during the baseline assessment. Body composition (percentage body fat) was measured using standardised bio-impedance protocols. BMI was calculated as (weight/height2) and the World Health Organization criteria [24] were used to classify BMI into underweight <18.5, normal weight 18.5–24.9, overweight 25.0–29.9 and obese =30.0 kg.m- 2. Central obesity was defined as waist circumference >88 cm for women and >102 cm for men.

UK Biobank is relatively representative of the general population with respect to age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation within the age range recruited but is not representative in other regards, such as prevalence of obesity and comorbidities, which may indicate a healthy volunteer selection bias [37]. Whilst this limits the ability to generalise prevalence rates, estimates of the magnitude of associations regarding disease or mortality and disease risk in the current study should nevertheless be generalisable [13, 37, 38].

We also confirm and extend recent observations that the association between TV viewing and mortality is attenuated by a level of physical activity. This has two potentially important implications for public health. First, interventions to reduce discretionary sedentary behaviours to improve future health outcomes may be more economically and clinically effective if they are targeted at those with low levels of strength, fitness and physical activity.

Introduction Personality traits can be used to identify the appropriate weight loss treatment and management strategies for obese patients (Munro et al., 2011). The outcome of different weight loss interventions in obese people seems to be influenced by their underlying personality traits (Gerlach et al., 2015). For example, obese people with high reward dependence and cooperativeness are more willing to participate in behavioral group therapies (Sullivan et al., 2007). Moreover, patients with lower novelty seeking are more likely to effectively lose gain with this type of intervention (Sullivan et al., 2007). On the other hand, neuroticism and conscientiousness are respectively associated with the effectiveness of sirbutramin and orlitstat pharmacological weight loss therapies (Gerlach et al., 2015). Low conscientiousness and high neuroticism, in particular, have been associated with higher body mass index (BMI) (Sutin and Terracciano, 2017) and poorer health outcomes (Atherton et al., 2014). High neuroticism has been found to enhance the effect of polygenetic predisposition toward overweight and obesity (Clarke et al., 2015), and it has been associated with inflammatory indices and other environmental/social risk factors relating to obesity (Sutin and Terracciano, 2017). The tendency toward less physical activity and/or more sedentary behaviours observed in highly neurotic people has also been proposed to be at least partially responsible for the association with BMI (Kjelsas and Augestad, 2004; Sutin and Terracciano, 2016, 2017). Conflicting evidence has however been reported. Some studies (n = 11 554; n = 1 495 and n = 30 722, respectively) have shown low neuroticism to be associated with higher BMI (Kakizaki et al., 2008; Otonari et al., 2012; Shim et al., 2014), while a Danish study (n = 5 286) has failed in finding any association between BMI and neuroticism in either men or women (Wimmelmann et al., 2018). Psychological and psychiatric comorbidities might partially explain the discrepancies across studies (Paans et al., 2016). Moreover, other unrelated factors, such as the work dimension, and in particular the physical workload, have been found to interact with neuroticism in influencing BMI (Blanch and Aluja, 2013). The association between BMI and personality seems also to differ remarkably between genders, and is more consistent in women rather than men (Sutin and Terracciano, 2016, 2017). Finally, it is worth noticing that the ethnicity of the participants varies between studies, as the samples included Asian (Kakizaki et al., 2008; Otonari et al., 2012; Shim et al., 2014), European (Wimmelmann et al., 2018) or multi-ethnical participants (Sutin and Terracciano, 2016).  In recent years, a growing body of research has linked personality traits to cognitive performance (Burles et al., 2014; Caselli et al., 2016; Chapman et al., 2017; Dar-Nimrod et al., 2012; Munoz et al., 2013; Robison et al., 2017; Waggel et al., 2015; Wettstein et al., 2016). In particular, low neuroticism has been associated to a better executive function in middle-aged (Caselli et al., 2016; Robison et al., 2017) and elderly adults (Chapman et al., 2017; Waggel et al., 2015). Remarkably, executive function has been reported to predict the health behavior of the individuals more accurately than neuroticism (Hall et al., 2014), and reduced executive function has been associated with neuroticism and two lifestyle risk factors for obesity, namely sedentary behavior and fatty food consumption (Hall et al., 2014). The factors underlying this association are still unclear. Increased cortisol is associated with both specific personality traits and worse cognitive performance (Ouanes et al., 2017), however it does not seem to be mediating the link between personality and cognition (Ouanes et al., 2017). Nonetheless, the intertwining between executive function and neuroticism might play a role in predisposing to obesity development. In fact, obesity has been linked to an impairment in executive function (Dassen et al., 2018), and therapies targeting executive function seem to meliorate health behaviors in obese people by improving their cognitive flexibility (Allom et al., 2018). On the other hand, overweight people are understudied, and evidence is lacking regarding the existence of executive functions impairments in these population (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, information are lacking regarding overweight individuals’ cognitive performance on other domains, such as fluid intelligence, which has also been found to be impaired in obesity (Spyridaki et al., 2014). Nonetheless, overweight in mid-life has been related to lower short-term memory performance in later life (Hassing et al., 2010). Accordingly, high BMI has been related to accelerated cognitive aging (Kirton and Dotson, 2016).""","""In recent years, a growing body of research has linked personality traits to cognitive performance (Burles et al., 2014; Caselli et al., 2016; Chapman et al., 2017; Dar-Nimrod et al., 2012; Munoz et al., 2013; Robison et al., 2017; Waggel et al., 2015; Wettstein et al., 2016).

The answers “Yes” and “No” were respectively assigned the values of 1 and 0, and the scores were summed up to obtain the neuroticism score.  Short-term memory was assessed with the PM and numeric memory tests. The PM test consisted in instructing the participants to memorise the position of as many matching pairs of cards as possible. The cards were then turned face down on the screen, and the participants were asked to touch as many pairs as possible in the fewest tries. Two rounds were conducted, the first round using 3 pairs of cards and the second 6 pairs of cards. As recommended by the UK Biobank website, the number of incorrect matches in round (Field ID: 399) was used as outcome variable. Only the second round, more challenging and with more variability in the responses, was considered in the present study. For the assessment of short-term numeric memory, the participants were shown a two-digit number and they were asked to remember it after a brief pause. The procedure was followed until the participant made an error or if they had remembered the maximum of twelve digits. The maximum number of digits remembered correctly was considered in this study.  Reasoning ability was measured using the fluid intelligence test, assessed with a touch-screen questionnaire consisting of 13 items. The total score obtained by the participants was considered in this study. Finally, for the TMT, the participants were presented with a series of labelled circles and instructed to touch them according to a particular ordering rule.

BMI was acquired at three time-points: the first assessment took place between 2006 and 2010; the second assessment was carried out between 2012 and 2013 (time interval between 1 and 4 years); the third assessment was carried out after 2014 (time interval between 5 and 10 years from baseline).  Neuroticism score was derived by the sum of 12 neurotic behavioral domains, as provided by the UK Biobank. In particular, the participants had been asked to answer questions regarding their tendency to experience mood swings (Field ID: 1920; “Does your mood often go up and down?”), miserableness (Field ID: 1930; “Do you ever feel 'just miserable' for no reason?”), irritability (Field ID: 1940; “Are you an irritable person?”), sensitivity/ hurt feelings (Field ID: 1950; “Are your feelings easily hurt?”), fed-up feelings (Field ID: 1960; “Do you often feel 'fed-up'?”), nervous feelings (Field ID: 1970; “Would you call yourself a nervous person?”), worrier/anxious feelings (Field ID: 1980; “Are you a worrier?”), a sensation of being tense/ ‘highly strung’ (Field ID: 1990; “Would you call yourself tense or 'highly strung'?”), worry too long after embarrassment (Field ID: 2000; “Do you worry too long after an embarrassing experience?”), suffer from ‘nerves’ (Field ID: 2010; “Do you suffer from 'nerves'?”), loneliness/isolation feelings (Field ID: 2020; “Do you often feel lonely?”), and guilty feelings (Field ID: 2030; “Are you often troubled by feelings of guilt?”). The answers “Yes” and “No” were respectively assigned the values of 1 and 0, and the scores were summed up to obtain the neuroticism score.  Short-term memory was assessed with the PM and numeric memory tests. The PM test consisted in instructing the participants to memorise the position of as many matching pairs of cards as possible. The cards were then turned face down on the screen, and the participants were asked to touch as many pairs as possible in the fewest tries. Two rounds were conducted, the first round using 3 pairs of cards and the second 6 pairs of cards. As recommended by the UK Biobank website, the number of incorrect matches in round (Field ID: 399) was used as outcome variable. Only the second round, more challenging and with more variability in the responses, was considered in the present study. For the assessment of short-term numeric memory, the participants were shown a two-digit number and they were asked to remember it after a brief pause. The procedure was followed until the participant made an error or if they had remembered the maximum of twelve digits. The maximum number of digits remembered correctly was considered in this study.  Reasoning ability was measured using the fluid intelligence test, assessed with a touch-screen questionnaire consisting of 13 items. The total score obtained by the participants was considered in this study. Finally, for the TMT, the participants were presented with a series of labelled circles and instructed to touch them according to a particular ordering rule. The test consists of two parts: in the first one (path A), less challenging, the labels are represented solely by numbers; in the second part (path B), alphanumeric labels are assigned to the circles. The duration to complete both paths was recorded. We derived the TMT ratio (B/A) as a measure of executive function (Salthouse, 2011), where a high TMT ratio reflected a worse performance.  2.3. Covariates Age was assessed based on the date of birth and the date of attending the assessment centre, truncated to whole year part. The ethnic background was chosen from an amalgam of sequential branching questions. We grouped the answers in order to reduce the number of possible backgrounds to six categories, corresponding to the “top” categories of each branch: white, mixed, Asian or Asian British, black or black British, Chinese, other ethnic groups. To assess education, the participants were asked to select which qualifications they possessed amongst: college/university degree, A/AS levels or equivalent, O/GCSEs levels or equivalent, CSEs or equivalent, NVQ/HND/HNC or equivalent, other professional qualifications, none of the above. Participants could select more than one answer. Qualifications were recoded as a binary variable, based on whether the participants held or not a college/university degree.  Smoking status was coded as current smoker, previous smoker, or never smoked. To assess alcohol intake frequency, participants were asked to report whether they consumed alcohol: daily or almost daily, three or four times a week, once or twice a week, one to three times a month, on special occasions only, or never. Touchscreen-based questions were used to assess physical activity. The questions pertained the weekly frequency and duration (in minutes) of the walking, moderate physical activity and vigorous physical activity sessions, similarly to the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. The answers less than zero and greater than 1 440 were discarded during the data quality check performed by the UK Biobank; additionally, the participants were asked to reconfirm if their answer was greater than 300. We then calculated the total metabolic equivalent per time (MET) values for each category, by using the coefficients obtained from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form (3.3 for walking, 4.0 for moderate physical activity, and 8.0 for vigorous physical activity). MET scores (minutes/week) were derived by the following formula: (No. of days per week of walking 10+ minutes* duration of walks* 3.3) + (No. of days per week of moderate physical activity 10+ minutes * duration of moderate physical activity* 4) + (No. of days per week of vigorous activity 10+ minutes * duration of vigorous physical activity* 8) (Bradbury et al., 2017).""","""Limited information on how BMI was measured and calculated but more detail about cognitive measures e.g....""Neuroticism score was derived by the sum of 12 neurotic behavioral domains, as provided by the UK Biobank.

Statistical analysis The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, v.24: https://www.ibm.com/analytics/data-science/predictive-analytics/spss-statistical-software) was used for statistical analyses. A series of separate multinomial logistic regression models were performed to investigate associations of BMI with neuroticism and cognitive performance on the numeric memory, FI, PM and TMT tests. Two models were carried out for a sensitivity analysis. The first model was corrected for age, gender, education and ethnical background. The second model was additionally corrected for smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, and physical activity. The threshold for significance was set at p < 0.01 for the cross-sectional analysis to correct for multiple testing according to Bonferroni’s approach (0.05/5 tests). Based on previous literature, we also tested for an effect of the interaction between neuroticism and gender on BMI. Furthermore, we investigated whether age could influence the association between BMI and neuroticism or cognitive function by also testing for the effect of the age*cognition interaction on BMI. The threshold for significance was set at p < 0.012, to correct for multiple testing (0.05 / 4 tests).  Additionally, we ran five generalized linear models (gamma with log-link) to investigate whether BMI, when treated as continuous instead of categorical, still showed the same pattern of associations with neuroticism and cognitive function. The same two abovementioned models were run. The threshold for significance was again set at p < 0.01 for the cross-sectional analysis to correct for multiple testing according to Bonferroni’s approach.  Correlations between neuroticism score and each of the cognitive tests were investigated via separate models according to the distribution of the dependent variables. ANOVA was used to test correlations with FI and PM (Glass et al., 1972; Harwell et al., 1992; Lix et al., 1996), while correlations with numeric memory were assessed with a negative binomial generalized linear model, and correlations with TMT were assessed with a gamma generalized linear model. The threshold for significance was set at p < 0.013, to correct for multiple testing according to Bonferroni. The same abovementioned adjusted models were used.  Individuals with high neuroticism tend to vary their weight more than individuals with lower neuroticism levels, in terms of decreases as well as increases in BMI (Sutin et al., 2011; Sutin and Terracciano, 2017). Thus, we investigated correlations between neuroticism and BMI variation over time. BMI variation was calculated by subtracting the baseline BMI from the BMI at each follow-up point, and considering the absolute value of the variation. As executive function has been reported to predict the health behavior of the individuals more accurately than neuroticism (Hall et al., 2014), we also investigated correlations between executive function and BMI variations. To this purpose, separate ANOVAs were carried out to test whether baseline neuroticism and TMT ratio could predict BMI variations at each of the two follow-up points.

""",Yes,Yes,,"""Low cardio-respiratory fitness (CRF) is a strong predictor of numerous health outcomes, including mortality, not only in general adult populations [1] but also in obese [2], hypertensive [3, 4], or diabetic [5] adults. Poor muscular strength, another component of fitness, has also been indicated as an important marker of mortality [6, 7] as well as adverse health outcomes such as frailty and sarcopenia [8]. Recent clinical trials [9,10,11,12] have demonstrated that compared with improving either CRF or muscle strength alone, improving both CRF and muscle strength simultaneously led to more favorable changes on intermediate cardio-metabolic risk factors and functional status; these intermediate outcomes are important predictors for clinical end-points [13, 14]. However, the prior clinical trials [9,10,11,12] did not include clinical end-points, and it would, in fact, be nearly impossible to establish clinical trials with sufficient statistical power to do so. In contrast, large-scale prospective observational studies can provide such evidence. However, a few observational studies evaluating combined impacts of CRF and muscle strength in relation to mortality risk merely included data from highly select populations of men (i.e. men who were either hypertensive [15] or adolescent [16] at baseline). This limitation precludes the ability to draw robust conclusions for general adult populations of men and women. Given that current public health guidelines [17] recommend that men and women engage in both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities across the whole lifespan, it is critical from clinical and public health standpoints to examine the combined impacts of CRF and muscle strength for mortality risk for a broader adult population.""",""" Recent clinical trials [9–12] have demonstrated that compared with improving either CRF or muscle strength alone, improving both CRF and muscle strength simultaneously led to more favorable changes on intermediate cardio-metabolic risk factors and functional status; these intermediate outcomes are important predictors for clinical end-points""",Yes,Yes,,"""However, a few observational studies evaluating combined impacts of CRF and muscle strength in relation to mortality risk merely included data from highly select populations of men (i.e. men who were either hypertensive [15] or adolescent [16] at baseline).

The risk categorization determined allocation to an individualized exercise protocol (S2 Material in Appendix), a methodology aimed at increasing the number of participants with exposure information whilst at the same time reducing the likelihood that participants experience any adverse medical events during the exercise test. Individuals with ‘minimal risk’ (n = 72,715) and ‘small risk’ (n = 11,257) carried out standard bike protocols, which consisted of (1) an initial 15-s seated-rest period, (2) a 2-min phase at constant power (30 watts for women; 40 watts for men), (3) a 4-min ramp phase with linear increases in power from their initial constant power to their individually assigned peak power (to 50 and 35% of predicted maximal workload for ‘minimal’ and ‘small’ risk, respectively), and (4) a 1-min recovery period. Individuals with ‘medium risk’ (n = 2812) cycled at the constant power level for 6 min. Participants were asked to cycle at 60 revolutions-per-minute (RPM) during all cycling phases. Individuals in the ‘high’ risk (n = 11,162) category only did a 2-min seated-rest assessment and were excluded from this analysis, as were those ‘ineligible’ for electrocardiograph testing (n = 1481).  Participants’ electrocardiograms were recorded at 500 Hz with a 4-lead electrocardiograph device (CAM-USB 6.5, Cardiosoft v6.51; two electrocardiograph electrodes on each upper limb) throughout the full test. The electrocardiograph signal was processed using the PhysioNet Toolkit [23] implementation of the SQRS algorithm [24], which applies a digital filter to the signal and identifies the distinctive downward slopes of QRS complexes. The resultant inter-beat-intervals were converted to beats-per-minute values, using “ihr” of the PhysioNet Toolkit [25] (restricting beat-to-beat heart rate changes to = 10 bpm), after which linear interpolation was applied to derive heart rate at 1-s resolution. In addition, we implemented data cleaning and quality control procedures (S3 Material in Appendix). Linear regression was performed to predict workload from heart rate (S4 Material in Appendix); the established linear relationship was then extrapolated to age-predicted maximum heart rate [26] to estimate an individual’s maximal power (watts) as an indicator of CRF. Consolidation procedures were applied to obtain the most robust CRF estimate (S5 Material in Appendix). To account for differences in body size, CRF was expressed as maximal power per fat-free mass (kg) (i.e. body mass–fat mass), the latter measured using bio-impedance analysis (Tanita BC-418MA).

Grip strength GS was assessed once in each hand using a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Jamar J00105), which can measure isometric grip force and was calibrated by staff at the start of each measurement day. Each participant grasped the handle of the device in their right hand while sitting upright on a chair with their forearm on the armrest, and whilst maintaining a 90° angle of their elbow, squeezed the handle as strongly as possible for about 3 s.

Men had greater intakes of energy and were less likely to have energy intakes above the estimated average requirement compared with women. Small, but significant, sex differences were found in the intakes of all macronutrients. For all macronutrients, men had greater absolute intakes while women had greater intakes as a percentage of energy. Women were more likely to have intakes that exceeded recommendations for total fat, saturated fat and total sugar. Men were less likely to achieve the minimum recommended intakes for protein, polyunsaturated fat and total carbohydrate. Over 95% of men and women were non-adherent to fibre recommendations. Sex differences in dietary intakes were moderated by age and to some extent by socioeconomic status.  Conclusions There are significant sex differences in adherence to dietary recommendations, particularly for sugar. However, given the increased focus on food groups and dietary patterns for nutritional policy, these differences alone may not be sufficient for policy and health promotion. Future studies that are able to explore the sex differences in intakes of different food groups that are risk factors for diet-related diseases are warranted to improve the current understanding of the differential impact of diet on health in women and men.""","""There were sex differences in energy intake and distribution.

Even modest dietary changes are associated with meaningful reductions in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, type 2 diabetes, specific cancer sites and their major risk factors, including hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension and obesity.4–9  In the UK and elsewhere, adults continue to consume too much saturated fat, sugar, red and processed meat and sugar-sweetened beverages, while intakes of fruit, vegetables, oily fish and fibre are insufficient.10 Recent analyses indicate that there is little or no evidence of change in the problematic nutrition patterns in UK adults, suggesting that current strategies to improve diet are insufficient at a population level.10–12  It is widely recognised that sex differences in dietary intakes and dietary behaviour exist; however these are not well characterised.13–18 Previous analyses of dietary intakes in the UK have relied on estimates from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey; a small study limited by well-documented under-reporting and estimates from expenditure intakes, which may not accurately reflect actual consumption.10 19 These national estimates did not examine sex differences as a primary outcome nor their variation across age and sociodemographic subpopulations.  Optimising dietary habits to improve population health requires systematically identified and evaluated data.20 Thus, a better understanding of dietary patterns of nutrient consumption by sex is crucial to establish priorities for dietary guidelines and to inform, design and implement strategies for reducing diet-related disease.

There are currently no studies in the UK that examine adherence to dietary guidelines, so it is difficult to place these results in context of the current literature. However, these findings suggest different areas of focus may be useful in targeting adherence to dietary guidelines in men and women, particularly for sugar. Several studies have shown that women have a higher intake of sugar compared with men.34–36 A potential explanation for this difference may be that women in the UK consume more fruit than men.10 Fruit is a source of natural sugar and therefore would result in increased total sugar without increasing free or added sugar intake. However, there is also evidence that women consume more foods high in added sugars than men, such as cookies, chocolate, and ice cream.37–39 A recent UK governmental report found there is robust evidence that adherence to sugar recommendations would result in substantial cost and health benefits.40 Therefore, future studies should examine sex differences in dietary sources of sugar to identify key foods for policy targeting.""","""This large study of over 200000 men and women from the UK Biobank showed that there are some notable sex differences in macronutrient intakes and adherence to dietary recommendations.

We investigated predictors of mortality in UK Biobank participants during a 5 year period. We aimed to investigate the associations between most of the available measurements and 5 year all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and to develop and validate a prediction score for 5 year mortality using only self-reported information.  Methods Participants were enrolled in the UK Biobank from April, 2007, to July, 2010, from 21 assessment centres across England, Wales, and Scotland with standardised procedures. In this prospective population-based study, we assessed sex-specific associations of 655 measurements of demographics, health, and lifestyle with all-cause mortality and six cause-specific mortality categories in UK Biobank participants using the Cox proportional hazard model. We excluded variables that were missing in more than 80% of the participants and all cardiorespiratory fitness test measurements because summary data were not available. Validation of the prediction score was done in participants enrolled at the Scottish centres. UK life tables and census information were used to calibrate the score to the overall UK population.""",,Yes,,,"""Findings About 500 000 participants were included in the UK Biobank. We excluded participants with more than 80% variables missing (n=746). Of 498 103 UK Biobank participants included (54% of whom were women) aged 37–73 years, 8532 (39% of whom were women) died during a median follow-up of 4·9 years (IQR 4·33–5·22). Self-reported health (C-index including age 0·74 [95% CI 0·73–0·75]) was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in men and a previous cancer diagnosis (0·73 [0·72–0·74]) was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in women. When excluding individuals with major diseases or disorders (Charlson comorbidity index >0; n=355 043), measures of smoking habits were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality. The prognostic score including 13 self-reported predictors for men and 11 for women achieved good discrimination (0·80 [0·77–0·83] for men and 0·79 [0·76–0·83] for women) and significantly outperformed the Charlson comorbidity index (p<0·0001 in men and p=0·0007 in women). A dedicated website allows the interactive exploration of all results along with calculation of individual risk through an online questionnaire.  Interpretation Measures that can simply be obtained by questionnaires and without physical examination were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality in the UK Biobank population.

Epidemiological studies that obtain several measurements through questionnaires, physical assessments, and biological samples can be done to compare the prognostic value of risk factors of short-term mortality and provide new hypotheses about health determinants. Moreover, these risk factors can be combined into a prognostic index to provide information about individual mortality risk or other health-related measures. Traditionally, association with mortality has been studied for one risk factor at a time,2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and the few studies that have investigated more than one risk factor did not assess different causes of death and based their analyses on small study samples.7 Several prognostic indices for short-term mortality exist, but they have mainly been developed for and assessed in older individuals or in high-risk populations.8, 9 Furthermore, the small sample sizes and the small number of risk factors investigated are the main limitations of all previous studies.""",,Yes,,,"""The UK Biobank project10 includes about 500 000 men and women aged 40–70 years.

Discrimination was assessed on the basis of ten-fold cross-validated Harrell's C-index, accounting for competing risk.17, 18 The Harrell's C-index is a generalisation of the area under the receiving characteristic curve for survival data. All C-indices reported include the effect of age in addition to the examined covariates.  We chose the 20 variables with the highest C-index for each cause-specific mortality category after excluding variables that were not self-reported, and hence unsuitable for inclusion in an online questionnaire. Self-reported measurements include all those variables that are directly obtained by asking the participants and not assessed through a medical specialist or a medical device. We used a backward stepwise variable selection approach with Akaike information criterion used to select independent variables to include in the final prediction model. The score was geographically validated in participants enrolled at the only two Scottish centres that were part of the UK Biobank.  Calibration was assessed using calibration plots and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests based on risk deciles. To obtain a 5-year mortality risk representative of the UK population, we reweighted the baseline hazard using life-tables from England and Wales from the years 2009–11. We further used census information from the year 2011. See appendix 1, p 2, for details about calibration.

Several key messages can be deduced from this study. First, measures that can simply be obtained by verbal interview without physical examination are the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality in middle-aged to elderly individuals. Self-reported health and walking pace were the strongest predictors in both sexes and across different causes of deaths. Second, several risk factors have different discrimination abilities in men and women.

Also, the strength of the relationship tends to vary across populations, which may partially be a reflection of the secular trends in age at menarche (generally downwards) that has been observed in many populations.6, 7, 8 Furthermore, although most studies on the association between reproductive factors and adiposity used body mass index (BMI) as their measure of adiposity, some studies also used body fat percentage, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio or the waist-to-height ratio.4, 9 Plausibly, these might show different relationships with reproductive health factors. Evidence on the relationship of other reproductive health factors, such as age at first birth and age at menopause, with excess body weight is more limited,3, 10 and small study sizes have hampered identification of clinically important differences in the association between reproductive health factors and of body adiposity across population subgroups. Moreover, although some studies found a link between parity and excess body weight,11, 12, 13 the evidence is inconsistent, fuelling the discussion as to whether the association is the result of physiological effects of pregnancy or due to socioeconomic and lifestyle factors associated with family size and child rearing.

The study confirms the previously reported inverse association between age at menarche and subsequent levels of body adiposity in women several decades later. Moreover, findings from the current study add to the evidence base by demonstrating that the relationship is similar across a range of subgroup analyses, and is apparent irrespective of the measure of body adiposity used. Age at first birth was also linearly and inversely associated with body adiposity in later life, whereas there was little evidence for an association between age at menopause and body adiposity. Furthermore, there was a positive association between parity in women and the number of children fathered in men, suggesting that the association between parity and adiposity is more likely to be due to the adverse lifestyle and socioeconomic factors associated with child rearing than due to the biological effects of childbearing.  Most previous studies on the association between reproductive health factors and body adiposity have used BMI as the metric of adiposity, with comparatively few studies examining whether other markers of body adiposity—in particular, central obesity, such as waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio—are similarly associated. In the present analyses, there was no indication that the associations between reproductive health factors with adiposity differed according to the measure used, and similarly, that any of the other measures of adiposity were more informative than BMI.17  Age at menarche The inverse association between age at menarche and body adiposity reported here is in agreement with the findings from a recent meta-analysis of 10 cohort studies which showed that early menarche (<12 years of age) was associated with higher adult BMI, with a mean BMI difference of 0.34 kg m-2 between women who experienced early menarche versus those who experienced menarche at 12 or more years of age.5 Excess body weight is a strong risk factor for a range of disease outcomes;17, 18, 19 under the assumption of causality, an inverse association between age at menarche and adiposity might therefore suggest that women with an early menarche are at increased risk of obesity-related disease outcomes later in life. Evidence for the long-term consequences of age at menarche on chronic disease outcomes generally supports this hypothesis, and shows that early menarche is associated with an increased risk of a range of conditions including type II diabetes,20 cardiovascular diseases5, 21 and all-cause mortality.5 Nonetheless, the magnitude and shape of the relationship varies across populations, and the possible biological pathways for an association of early age at menarche, body adiposity and subsequent chronic diseases merits further examination, taking account of the roles of heritable factors, dietary habits and physical inactivity throughout life. Genome-wide association studies of age at menarche have identified several obesity-related variants to be associated with earlier menarche,22, 23 indicating that there are complex genetic relationships between adiposity and age at menarche in normal trajectories of growth and development, which could influence disease risk throughout the life course.  Age at first birth and number of live births or children Parity has dropped and the age at which a woman has her first child has increased across successive generations in many populations.6, 7, 8 Evidence on the association between age at first birth and body adiposity is limited to that from a study among Swedish women, which reported that older age at first birth was associated with a lower level of BMI 30 years later.3 In the present analyses, we confirmed these findings and showed that older age at first birth was associated with lower levels of body adiposity later in life, with some indication that the effect was stronger among women with a lower SES as compared with women with a higher SES. There was also evidence of a positive association between the number of live births and body adiposity, which is in agreement with previous findings on the association between parity and body adiposity.11, 12, 13 The Million Women Study showed that women with four or more births had a 1.7 kg m–2 higher BMI as compared with nulliparous women, which is comparable to the 1.3 kg m–2 difference in BMI reported here.12 A novel finding of the current analyses is that the latter association is also present in men; men who had fathered four or more children had a 0.8 kg m–2 higher BMI as compared with men without children. This suggests that a significant proportion of the association between parity and later adiposity may be attributed to behavioural risk factors associated with child rearing including an increased likelihood of adverse dietary habits, accumulated financial and physical pressures, and mental depletion.  Age at menopause A few small studies have examined the association between age at menopause and body adiposity. A report from 522 women in the Framingham Heart Study did not detect differences between menopausal age and several measures of body composition, including BMI and waist circumference.4 Similarly, results from a Japanese study among 1022 women found no differences in BMI by age at natural menopause.10 The present study included nearly 200 000 postmenopausal women from the UK Biobank robustly confirms the findings of previous studies, and most definitely shows the lack of a cross-sectional association between age at menopause and adiposity.""","""This present study provides a comprehensive examination of the cross-sectional associations between reproductive health factors and a range of measures of body adiposity in a contemporary Western population.

We assessed the sex-specific relationships and their differences between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI).  Methods and Results Between 2006 and 2010, the UK Biobank recruited over 500 000 participants aged 40 to 69 years across the United Kingdom. During 7 years of follow-up, 5710 cases of MI (28% women) were recorded among 265 988 women and 213 622 men without a history of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Cox regression models yielded adjusted hazard ratios for MI associated with body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio""",,Yes,,,"""There was an approximate log-linear relationship between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of MI in both sexes. A 1-SD higher in body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio, respectively, were associated with hazard ratios (confidence intervals) for MI of 1.22 (1.17; 1.28), 1.35 (1.28; 1.42), 1.49 (1.39; 1.59), and 1.34 (1.27; 1.40) in women and of 1.28 (1.23; 1.32), 1.28 (1.23; 1.33), 1.36 (1.30; 1.43), and 1.33 (1.28; 1.38) in men. The corresponding women-to-men ratios of hazard ratios were 0.96 (0.91; 1.02), 1.07 (1.00; 1.14), 1.15 (1.06; 1.24), and 1.03 (0.97; 1.09).  Conclusions Although general and central adiposity measures each have profound deleterious effects on the risk of MI in both sexes, a higher waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio conferred a greater excess risk of MI in women than in men. Waist-to-hip ratio was more strongly associated with the risk of MI than body mass index in both sexes, especially in women.""",,Yes,,,"!Excess adipose tissue is a major, and increasingly common, risk factor for chronic diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI), the leading cause of death worldwide.1, 2 In 2016, the World Health Organization estimated that more than 40% of women and 39% of men worldwide were overweight (defined as a body mass index [BMI] of >25 kg/m2) and that over 15% of women and 11% of men were obese (BMI >30 kg/m2).3  BMI is the most widely used measure to assess the prevalence of overweight and obesity across populations and to quantify the detrimental effects of excess adipose tissue on the risk of MI in later life. However, BMI is a measure of general adiposity and does not discriminate between adipose tissue present in visceral and subcutaneous areas. Yet, as compared with subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue is more metabolically active, is closely related to insulin resistance, and may be more strongly associated with cardiometabolic risk.4, 5 Measures of central adiposity and body composition, including waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio, may, therefore, be better suited than BMI for quantifying the etiological relationship between adiposity and cardiovascular disease. Although some studies have reported that measures of central adiposity are more strongly related to cardiovascular risk than BMI,6, 7, 8, 9, 10 others have found minimal differences across anthropometric measures and reported that each measure was similarly associated with the risk of future MI.11, 12  There are substantial sex differences in body fat distribution, with a predominance of subcutaneous fat in women and visceral fat in men.13, 14 Although the association between BMI and the risk of MI is broadly similar between women and men,15 it is conceivable that there is a sex differential in the effects of central adiposity on the risk of MI—with potentially stronger effects in women than men. However, most previous studies did not report the associations between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of MI separately for women and men.

In the UK, it was reported that 3 million people had tried the LCHO diet in 2003 1, with the Atkins diet books alone having sold over 45 million books in the latter half of the 20th century 2. Carbohydrate (CHO) restriction, where the restriction is sufficient and adhered to 3-5, appears to confer particular metabolic benefits for the management of type 2 diabetes 4, 6, including a reduction in post-prandial glycaemia. However, the long-term health effects in the wider population are not clear. This raises questions of its long-term safety and efficacy, which warrants ongoing investigation into the dietary habits of such individuals 7, 8.  It is important to note that there is no singular definition of what constitutes a LCHO diet, although a CHO content comprising <26% of calories (or <130 g CHO) has been suggested as a cut-off 9. Variations of the LCHO diet differ in their permitted levels of macronutrients, such as the low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, which emphasises the importance of increasing fat consumption 10, whereas others increase protein to a greater degree 11. Absolute intakes (i.e. additional grammes) of protein or fat may not increase at all, mirroring a low calorie diet as a result of a reduced overall intake 12. The replacing food or macronutrient may also be an important determinant of the health effects of LCHO diets 4, 7, 8. However, most of the data on food and nutrient consumption in a LCHO diet have been collected in clinical trials 5-8, where participants are instructed to follow a particular dietary pattern. Therefore, to determine nutritional adequacy, it is important to establish what free-living individuals on a CHO-restricted diet are consuming.  A recent study compared the dietary intakes of individuals consuming fewer than 40% of calories from CHO with those who were consuming =40% in the UK. Although people on a reduced-CHO diet consumed more red and processed meat and fewer fruits compared to those on a normal-CHO diet, they also consumed more oily fish and vegetables 13. Therefore, CHO restriction may be associated with both healthy and less-healthy dietary choices. A weakness of the study was the high cut-off used to define the LCHO group with the aim of generating a sufficient number of subjects from the limited data available.""","Description and definition low-carbohydrate diets, proposed health benefits and possible importance of individual food/macronutrients which form part of a LCHO",Yes,Yes,,"""A recent study compared the dietary intakes of individuals consuming fewer than 40% of calories from CHO with those who were consuming =40% in the UK.

A weakness of the study was the high cut-off used to define the LCHO group with the aim of generating a sufficient number of subjects from the limited data available. A lower boundary would be more likely to produce a group of individuals intentionally reducing their CHO intake and thus produce a more accurate representation of dietary and nutrient consumption. To identify sufficient numbers of people consuming a LCHO, a large sample size is required. The UK Biobank contains dietary and anthropometric data for more than 500 000 people.

Total fruits and vegetables were both calculated by totalling the number of different reported fruits and vegetables consumed over the four dietary recalls, without consideration for the portion size reported. In other words, if an individual reported consuming any serving size of a fruit or vegetable (half a portion, one, two), it was counted as one piece consumed. This was used to indicate the variety of fruits and vegetables consumed, which is considered an important aspect of a healthful diet.  Statistical analysis To determine differences in normally distributed dependent variables, independent t-tests were used. The Mann–Whitney U-test was used to examine differences in intake of ordinal variables. Proportions between groups were compared using chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact test where cells did not have sufficient numbers, with a Bonferroni correction being used to account for multiple comparisons. Independent t-tests were carried out to determine whether the TDI was significant between the LCHO and NCHO diets. One-way analyses of variance were carried out to determine whether the TDI was significantly different between ordinal dietary variables and bivariate correlations were carried out to determine the relationship between the TDI and continuous dietary variables. Where significant relationships were observed between the TDI and dietary intake, the dataset was split into quartiles of the TDI and the tests described above were carried out to determine whether the differences in dietary intake observed between the LCHO and NCHO diets remained in each of the quartiles. To rule out the confounding effect of people on a NCHO diet following a vegan or vegetarian diet, the above tests were run with and without people self-reporting as vegan or vegetarian. We examined the number of 24-h dietary recalls for the LCHO and the NCHO groups, and sensitivity analyses were run including only those people with more than one 24-h dietary recall completed.

There were also differences in the frequency of red meats (beef, lamb and pork) consumed, with a greater percentage of the <26% kcal group consuming these foods two or more times week compared to the =45% kcal group (see Supporting information, Table S1) and a greater percentage of the =45% reporting never consuming these foods compared to the <26% kcal group. However, once vegans and vegetarians were accounted for, there was no difference in the never-consumers. Reported differences in frequency of intake of these food groups were minimised when LCHO was defined as <130 g day–1 from CHO (see Supporting information, Table S1). Processed meats were consumed with greater frequency in the NCHO group compared to the LCHO groups when defined by grammes (see Supporting information, Table S1). Median daily intake of nuts, seeds and oily fish was significantly higher in the LCHO groups (Table 2), although the intake of these items was relatively low, with only 20% of the whole cohort consuming the recommended amount of oily fish twice a week (see Supporting information, Table S1). Similarly, the NCHO groups consumed significantly more pulses than the LCHO groups, although the overall consumption of these items was low (Table 2).  More than half of both LCHO groups consumed butter as their spread of choice compared to one-third of the NCHO groups (Table 3). People consuming a NCHO diet also reported a significantly greater amount and variety of fruits and vegetables consumed (Table 3). Of note, most people on both LCHO diets reported having consumed zero types of fruits across the 24-h dietary recalls, with a further quarter having only one portion (Table 2). Similarly, a greater proportion of people on a LCHO diet reported consuming zero types of vegetables across the 24-h dietary recalls, although there were no differences between the groups with respect to the percentage of people consuming more than four servings across the dietary recalls.  Intake of macro- and micronutrients The reported intakes of macronutrients, total sugar and fibre were all significantly different regardless of whether LCHO was calculated by kcal or the absolute number of grammes (Table 4). All groups exceeded the recommendations for saturated fat. Both LCHO groups reported a fibre intake of =11 g per day but, across all groups, fibre intake fell short of the current recommendations of the American Association of Analytical Chemists of 30 g day–1 (approximately 24 g fibre day–1 as calculated via the Englyst method used in UK Biobank).

There were significant differences in intakes of micronutrients between the LCHO and NCHO diets when LCHO was calculated by <26% kcal, although the mean (SD) %RNI exceeded 100 across the whole cohort for all micronutrients except potassium [LCHO: 98.2% (26.5%); NCHO: 111.9% (29.1%), P < 0.0001].

Individuals in the NCHO groups reported consuming substantially more foods such as doughnuts, pastries, biscuits and chocolate compared to the LCHO groups. A potential advantage of LCHO diets includes the observation that, by reducing dietary CHO, such diets will inevitably reduce added sugars 13. Furthermore, because much of the added sugar in the UK diet comes from foods that are also high in fat, LCHO diets lead to a reduction in these energy-dense, highly palatable items, which are over-consumed across the UK population 28. The present analysis suggests this may be the case and the findings are supported by a cross-sectional study in a US population reporting that added sugars provided 4% kcal in the LCHO group (<30% kcal from CHO) versus 21% in the high CHO group (>55% kcal from CHO) 29. Reverse causality cannot be ruled out, although a previous study also found that the reduction in CHO was associated with a selective reduction in added sugars 13. The UK Biobank dataset provides total sugars from all sources (all mono- and disaccharides, including those from milk and present in the structure of foods, such as fruit and vegetables) and so it is not possible to determine the association between the CHO restriction and added sugar restriction in the present study. In any case, to determine whether a LCHO diet leads to a specific reduction in added sugars, a prospective study in people intentionally following a LCHO diet would be required.  Similar to a previous analysis 13, the present study finds that individuals in the LCHO group consume higher quantities of meat, poultry and fish compared to people on a NCHO diet. In general, these differences were small and the statistical significance is a consequence of the large sample size in the study. Poultry appeared to be the most frequently consumed source of animal protein across the whole cohort and close to half of individuals reported consuming beef, lamb and pork less than once per week. This likely reflects the fact that the BIOBANK and similar volunteer cohorts tend to engage in healthier behaviours than the wider population 30. However, only 20% of people in the LCHO group and 15% in the NCHO groups met the current recommendations for oily fish consumption. The consumption of vegetable-sources of protein was higher in the NCHO groups but, in general, they were consumed in small amounts across the cohort. Nuts, seeds and pulses are also high in micronutrients, fibre and other non-nutritive components likely beneficial for health 31-33. Therefore, most individuals in the UK BIOBANK cohort would benefit from increasing their consumption of oily fish, nuts, seeds and pulses, irrespective of whether they are consuming a NCHO or LCHO diet.  Fruit and vegetable intake were calculated by summing each different fruit and vegetable that was consumed over each of the 24-h dietary recalls and thus appeared high compared to typically reported intakes 13. Fruit was consumed much less frequently and in much less variety in the LCHO compared to the NCHO group, which might be a result of individuals on a LCHO diet attempting to avoid excessive ‘sugar’. Mono- and di-saccharides are often referred to under the umbrella of ‘sugar’ in the lay press, despite lactose, glucose and fructose having substantially different glycaemic indices 34 and distinct metabolic effects. For example, fructose consumed in excess, and in particular in liquid form, is causally related to hepatic triglyceride deposition 35, whereas fruit consumed in typical quantities lowers post-prandial glucose compared to starch and other sugars, without deleterious effects on metabolic function 36. If individuals are concerned about the glycaemic effect of whole fruits, advice could be offered on low-glycaemic varieties.  The LCHO groups had a higher percentage of people consuming zero servings of vegetables over the five dietary recalls compared to the NCHO groups. Two previous studies have indicated that people consuming a LCHO eating pattern eat more vegetables, which may be due to their largely negligible available CHO content 13, 37. The difference in the present study may be that the LCHO group in the UK BIOBANK had higher material deprivation. Vegetables, when eaten in variety, can provide a substantial amount of fibres, micronutrients and non-nutritive compounds 38. Fibre is particularly important when individuals are consuming fewer high-fibre foods such as cereals, wholegrain breads and fruits. Notwithstanding the limitation of the LCHO data originating primarily from one 24-dietary recall, it is of some concern that a large proportion of people report having zero vegetables. Individuals who aim to follow a LCHO diet should be counselled to consume sufficient vegetables, with an emphasis on the benefits for general and gastrointestinal health.  An oft-cited concern regarding LCHO diets is that they may be deficient in key nutrients 2. In the present study, only potassium and magnesium were lower than the recommended intakes for the LCHO diets. Caution must be applied to these results because 24-h dietary recalls can be unreliable for micronutrients 39. Nevertheless, potassium and magnesium are under-consumed across the population, with lower intakes in reduced-carbohydrate diets being reported previously 13, and potassium intake from 24-h dietary recalls may be comparable to dietary records 39. Increasing the consumption of fruits (low-glycaemic if necessary) and vegetables alongside, nuts, dairy products and oily fish would be a sensible, whole-diet centred recommendation for people consuming both LCHO and NCHO diets.  To our knowledge, the calorie contribution of alcohol in LCHO diets has not been discussed at length previously. Alcohol consumption in this study is significantly higher in both LCHO groups than in the NCHO groups, even when the proportion of CHO is calculated from non-alcohol kcal. If we calculate a LCHO diet from total energy intake (data not shown), alcohol contributes up to 16% of the calories consumed in the LCHO group. We note this because alcohol calories are not mentioned in documents suggesting cut-offs for LCHO diets 9 and, accordingly, future analyses in this area should take this into account. Furthermore, alcohol intake should be considered within the context of CHO restriction and practitioners should work with patients to ensure that alcohol is not replacing CHO.""","""the reported intakes of keyfoods and food groups differed between the LCHO and NCHO groups, although both groups included foods thatwere both beneficial and potentially deleterious to long-term health.""",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,see 18,"""Some weaknesses must be acknowledged. Despite using a dataset of 210 665 people with complete dietary data, only 444 (<1%) reported consuming a LCHO diet consisting of 26% of non-alcohol calories, compared to 131 897 people (63%) consuming a NCHO diet. Therefore, the dietary intake of the LCHO reported in the present study has a greater margin of error compared to the NCHO diet.

This would also address the limitation of the present study in that we cannot be sure these individuals were intentionally following a LCHO diet. It would also be useful to determine the reason why people choose to follow the diet to observe whether this influences dietary choices such as the consumption of fruits.  In conclusion, the present study finds that self-reported dietary intake in LCHO dietary patterns has both favourable and potentially adverse characteristics compared to a NCHO diet. The LCHO groups consumed fewer high-sugar, high-fat snack items, as well as fewer fruit and vegetables and more alcohol.
