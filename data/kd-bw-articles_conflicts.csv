This logic has recently been supported by comparing results from an occupationally based study of civil servants (the second Whitehall study) with those from the geographically diverse British Regional Heart Study where near identical HRs across an array of known risk factors for coronary heart disease were reported.11 Similarly, in another cohort study, the relation of risk factor data collected at study induction to future CVD mortality was the same as that in a smaller, select group resurveyed 8 years later.16""",,Yes,No,Yes me,Yes,Yes,,""" funding for which comes from the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the UK Medical Research Council.

Neuroticism scores were positively skewed, and log/square root transformations did not improve the distribution; we report linear regression statistics because the final results were not meaningfully different from Spearman non-parametric correlations (not shown) but are easier to interpret, and assumptions of normality are to an extent eased in very large data-sets. 19 Because the MDD and BD groups had significantly higher neuroticism scores, as would be expected (both P<0.001), we removed participants with either of these disorders from the neuroticism analyses.  We used Poisson regression to estimate relative risk (RR) ratios for the MDD and BD analyses in relation to birth weight. RR ratios are preferable to odds ratios when the outcome is not rare (i.e. >10%) in the population, as odds ratios are poor estimates of RRs in such circumstances, and are harder to interpret. 20 P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS V.22, except for Fig. 1 which was made by using STATA SE v.13.  We found a positive association between year of birth and birth weight in kilograms, controlling for maternal smoking and maternal depression (r=0.01, P<0.001) suggesting a possible birth cohort effect. We tested each association unadjusted for covariates, and then adjusted for possible confounding variables: year of birth (i.e. controlling for possible age and birth cohort effects), Townsend deprivation score, White v. Black and minority ethnic, gender, maternal smoking and maternal depression. Finally, because physical disorders can be risk factors for psychiatric disorders 21 and are, therefore, potential mediators, for the MDD and BD analyses we added the covariates of hypertension, cardiac disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, type 2 diabetes, COPD and osteoporosis.

We formally tested whether significant birth weight and mood disorder associations were mediated by trait neuroticism scores, using the PROCESS macro. 12 Briefly, the effect of a predictor variable (e.g. birth weight group) on an outcome variable (e.g. MDD) can be either direct or indirect via a mediator (e.g. neuroticism). In a mediation context, a three-way association has two products: ‘Path A’: the association between the predictor and mediator (e.g. birth weight and neuroticism), and ‘Path B’: the mediator and outcome association adjusted for the predictor (e.g. association for neuroticism and MDD adjusted for birth weight). The indirect effect is the combined product of these two paths. 11,12 We used the PROCESS macro ‘Model 4’, which allows for dichotomous independent variables/outcomes in mediation models (bootstrap n=1000, bias-corrected).  We excluded all participants who had requested withdrawal from the UK Biobank as of March 2015.

Prospective studies can determine whether sex differences in body size associated with diabetes underpin some of the excess risk for CVD in women with type II diabetes.""",Yes,Yes,,"""Recent meta-analyses have demonstrated reliably that women with diabetes have a significantly, and clinically important, higher excess risk of both coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke as compared with similarly affected men.4 5 While these meta-analyses predominantly included individuals with type II diabetes, we also observed a greater excess risk of all-cause mortality and vascular events in women with type I diabetes, as compared with men.6  The mechanisms underlying these sex differences in the relationship between diabetes and CVD outcomes are not fully understood. However, accruing evidence suggests that real biological differences between men and women underpin the excess risk of diabetes-related cardiovascular risk in women. A sex differential in patterns of adiposity storage may be of particular importance.7 Previous studies have shown that levels of waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) differed more between women with and without diabetes than between men with and without diabetes.4 8 Moreover, analyses of the UK general practice research database indicated that men develop diabetes at a lower level of BMI compared with women, with levels of BMI being almost 2 units higher in women than in men at the time of diagnosis with type II diabetes.""","""Diabetes is a global health problem. An estimated 387 million individuals worldwide have diabetes, and its prevalence is expected to rise to 438 million individuals by 2035.1 ,2 The vast majority (90%) of individuals with diabetes have type II diabetes while the remaining 10% are individuals with the autoimmune condition of type I diabetes. Aside from population growth and ageing, increasing rates of overweight and obesity worldwide, are considered to be responsible, in large part, for the inexorable rise in the incidence of diabetes.  Diabetes, in either form, greatly increases an individual’s risk of a wide range of conditions, with cardiovascular disease (CVD) being the most common adverse outcome. People with diabetes have about twice the risk of CVD compared with those without diabetes, and it is estimated that CVD accounts for 44% of all fatalities in people with type I diabetes, and for 52% of all fatalities in type II diabetes.3 These estimates, however, assume that diabetes confers the same level of excess risk in women as in men, which is unlikely to be correct. Recent meta-analyses have demonstrated reliably that women with diabetes have a significantly, and clinically important, higher excess risk of both coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke as compared with similarly affected men.4 ,5 While these meta-analyses predominantly included individuals with type II diabetes, we also observed a greater excess risk of all-cause mortality and vascular events in women with type I diabetes, as compared with men.6  The mechanisms underlying these sex differences in the relationship between diabetes and CVD outcomes are not fully understood.

Diabetes was grouped but not continuous ""Definitions and measurements The presence of diabetes was based on a self-reported medical diagnosis. Age at first diagnosis of diabetes, and the use of medications for cholesterol, blood pressure or diabetes regulation were self-reported at study baseline. Type I diabetes was defined as the presence of the combination of a self-reported medical diagnosis of diabetes, an age at first diagnosis before 30 years, and the use of an insulin product. All other participants with a self-reported medical diagnosis of diabetes were considered to have type II diabetes. Smoking status was self-reported. Socioeconomic status was measured using the Townsend Deprivation Score, an area of residence-based index of material deprivation. Baseline physical measurements were obtained by trained staff using standardised procedures and regularly calibrated equipment. Blood pressure was measured using the Omron HEM-7015IT digital blood pressure monitor. Standing height was measured using a Seca 202 height measure. Waist and hip circumference were measured using a Wessex non-stretchable sprung tape measure. Weight and body fat percentage were measured using the Tanita BC-418 MA body composition analyser. BMI was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by the square of the standing height (m2). Waist-to-hip ratio was derived by dividing the waist circumference by the hip circumference.  Statistical analyses Baseline characteristics are presented as means (SD) for continuous variables and as percentages for categorical variables, separately by sex and diabetes status. Linear regression analyses were used to estimate the diabetes minus no diabetes differences in mean levels of cardiovascular risk factors, separately by sex and diabetes subtype. Linear regression analyses were also used to estimate the women minus men differences in the differences in mean risk factor levels conferred by type I or II diabetes. All models were adjusted for age. Secondary analyses were stratified by age at study baseline, socioeconomic status, ethnic background, time since diagnosis of diabetes and age at diagnosis of diabetes. In the sensitivity analyses, we also included individuals with pre-existing CVD, and defined type I diabetes as (1) an age at diagnosis <35 years and the exclusive report of insulin (and no other diabetes treatment) and (2) an age at diagnosis <35 years and having started insulin within 1 year of diagnosis of diabetes.""",No,NA,No me,,Cross sectional,Yes,Partially,NA me,"Table 2, Figure 1 and figure 2","MIssing test statistics Table 2, Table 3, Figure 2",Partially,NA,NA me,"Figure 1 reports women minus men difference in age-adjusted differences (95% CIs) in body size measures associated with type I and II diabetes, however they do not provide a p value for interactions",Not done,Yes,Partially,Yes me,"aTable 3   ""Results were virtually identical in the sensitivity analyses among all individuals, including those with pre-existing CVD (see eTable 3).""","Missing test statistics  ""Defining type I diabetes as those individuals aged <35 years at diagnosis who reported using insulin but no other diabetes treatment, or as an age at diagnosis <35 years and having started insulin within 1 year of diagnosis of diabetes, did not alter the findings materially (see eTables 1 and 2)....

We were therefore unable to examine sex differences in body size associated with diabetes at different stages of the glucose tolerance spectrum, before the clinical diagnosis of diabetes.  Body size was only measured at study baseline, which for some participants (particularly those with type I diabetes) was already several decades after the diagnosis of diabetes. We were therefore unable to determine whether the greater differences in body size in diabetes in women than in men are the result of diabetes itself, or whether they occurred in the transition from normoglycaemia to the manifestation of overt diabetes.

Cochlear implantation may therefore not be an appropriate intervention where the primary aim is to alleviate sleep difficulties""",Yes,Yes,,"""Tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of an external stimulus, affects about 16% of the adult population (Dawes et al. 2014; McCormack et al. 2014). Hearing loss has been established as a major risk factor for tinnitus (Nondahl et al. 2011). It has been suggested that degraded auditory input due to cochlear damage can trigger aberrant neuronal activity that is interpreted as tinnitus (Preece et al. 2003; Eggermont & Roberts 2014). The burden imposed by tinnitus is complex and extends beyond the persistence of the percept itself. The overall perceived handicap can include hearing difficulties, anxiety, depression, inability to relax, and sleep difficulties (Tyler & Baker 1983; Langguth 2011; McCormack et al. 2015). This heterogeneity in symptoms is reflected in the wide variety of proposed treatments, many of which are not supported by strong evidence for their effectiveness (Baguley et al. 2013).  Patients and clinicians agree that the management of tinnitus in those with profound hearing loss remains one of the top priorities for future tinnitus research (Hall et al. 2013). One potential device that has been proposed to manage tinnitus in the profoundly deaf is the cochlear implant (CI), which is an established intervention to restore useful aspects of hearing in these patients (Faulkner & Pisoni 2013). Cochlear implantation involves the surgical placement of an electrode array within the cochlea to stimulate spiral ganglion cells electrically to convey auditory information (Loizou 1998). On average, as many as 80% of candidates for cochlear implantation report experiencing tinnitus but the percept appears to subside in many after implantation (Baguley & Atlas 2007). As a result, it has been suggested that cochlear implantation should be considered as a treatment for tinnitus in the profoundly deaf (Tyler et al. 2008b). However, there remains a lack of comprehensive assessments of the burden of tinnitus and tinnitus-related symptoms after cochlear implantation (Baguley 2010) and therefore a lack of evidence for which symptoms may or may not be alleviated by implantation.  Many studies that have evaluated the impact of cochlear implantation on tinnitus have assessed outcome in terms of relief from the percept, for example, the reduction in tinnitus loudness (for a review see Baguley & Atlas 2007; Arts et al. 2012). Other studies have focused on designing and optimizing electrical stimulation strategies to suppress the percept (Chang & Zeng 2012; Arts et al. 2015). The assumption is that the suppression of tinnitus will alleviate its intrusiveness and reduce overall burden. However, although the number of profoundly deaf patients reporting tinnitus decreases following implantation, clinical observations suggest that a large proportion of CI recipients still experience some degree of tinnitus-related handicap (Pan et al. 2009; Bovo et al. 2011; Kloostra et al. 2015; Ramakers et al. 2015). A review of studies that have assessed the levels of tinnitus-related handicap following implantation suggested that about 25% of CI users experience a clinically significant tinnitus, that is, a degree of tinnitus-related handicap that may warrant intervention (Baguley 2010).  The presence of tinnitus after implantation may be explained by the finding that tinnitus is suppressed mostly when the implant is stimulating the auditory nerve and often reverts back to its original loudness (or becomes louder) soon after stimulation is turned off (Zeng et al. 2011; Vlastarakos et al. 2014). Therefore, it is plausible that tinnitus could be still bothersome in CI users at night time if the CI is switched off before going to sleep (Chadha et al. 2009), and consequently that they would not experience a reduction in the occurrence of tinnitus-related insomnia. However, despite the decades of research and converging evidence that sleep difficulties are one of the most common tinnitus-related complaints (Tyler & Baker 1983; Langguth 2011), the treatment of tinnitus-related insomnia remains an outstanding uncertainty for both clinicians and patients (Hall et al. 2013).""","""Introduction Tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of an external stimulus, affects about 16% of the adult population (Dawes et al. 2014; McCormack et al. 2014).

As the UK Biobank did not assess hearing sensitivity directly, self-reported use of a HA “most of the time” was assumed to be an indicator of a clinically diagnosed hearing loss. In addition, only those HA users with SRTs =0 dB on the DTT were included in the candidate group because it would be atypical for cochlear implantation candidates to have a negative SRT in an unaided speech in noise test such as the DTT (Donaldson et al. 2009).

These results are compatible with previous studies that have demonstrated the potential for electrical stimulation to reduce the percept of tinnitus (for a review, see Baguley & Atlas 2007).  Tinnitus still appears to cause considerable distress in a subset of implanted individuals. However, the data available in the UK Biobank were mostly retrospective and based on self-report and may not accurately reflect participants’ overall level of tinnitus-related distress. The self-reports of CI users might have been influenced by their experience of hearing restoration and/or by the hearing and speech therapy they received following implantation (Pan et al. 2009). However, the lack of general quality of life assessments did not allow for these or other potential psychological effects on well-being and reported tinnitus persistence or distress to be controlled for. While tinnitus can be experienced throughout the day, participants in the UK Biobank were only asked to judge their level of tinnitus-related distress during the periods when their tinnitus is at its worst, for example, when their CI is switched off. If so, the present results may overstate the overall level of distress experienced by CI users. If distress had been measured throughout the day, the difference in distress reported by the CI and candidate groups may have been even more pronounced.  One possible explanation for the lower level of tinnitus persistence among CI users is that they may have regained access to sound following implantation that could suppress or mask their tinnitus and/or reduce the extent to which they attend to their tinnitus. These effects could plausibly lead to a decrease in the perceived loudness of tinnitus and potentially give some relief from tinnitus-related emotional distress. However, neither suppression nor reduced attention to tinnitus may be fully effective or lasting if only due to the fact that currently CI stimulation is optimized for speech perception and may not be optimal for the suppression of tinnitus (Chang & Zeng 2012). Thus, many CI users will likely still experience periods of loud and distressing tinnitus as they did before implantation.

This association between tinnitus presence and sleep difficulties was found even after controlling for neuroticism, a factor shown to be associated with both tinnitus (McCormack et al. 2014, 2015) and sleep problems (Hintsanen et al. 2014).  Sleep difficulties did not vary as a function of either tinnitus persistence or distress. This finding is consistent with the fact that participants were asked to rate distress based on how much the tinnitus “noises” upset them. Consequently, the reported distress was likely driven by hearing tinnitus persistently (Fig. 3) rather than sleep problems. Additional analyses also determined that the prevalence of sleep difficulties was not influenced by HA use or by poor speech perception (Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/EANDH/A294). Thus, the presence of sleep difficulties appears to be predicated primarily on whether tinnitus is present or not, and would therefore be expected to occur in a majority of those who experience tinnitus. It is perhaps not surprising therefore that insomnia was identified by patients and clinicians as one of the outstanding priorities for tinnitus research (Hall et al. 2013).  Tinnitus Before and After Implantation The present data cannot provide definitive estimates of the effect of implantation on tinnitus because it is not known whether tinnitus reported as occurring only in the past was abolished before or after implantation.

If the finding of lower tinnitus persistence among CI users compared with candidates is replicated in further observational and controlled studies, cochlear implantation could be considered as a potential treatment option for persistent and emotionally distressing tinnitus in those whose hearing loss may not otherwise make them a candidate. In those cases, implantation may have the potential to make tinnitus less persistent, possibly leading to a reduction in emotional distress.""  ""Studies investigating other aspects of tinnitus handicap in CI users are encouraging (e.g., anxiety and depression; Andersson et al. 2009; Olze et al. 2011; Kloostra et al. 2015), but a more comprehensive characterization of tinnitus symptoms is still needed to understand the burden of tinnitus after cochlear implantation.

Additional analyses also determined that the prevalence of sleep difficulties was not influenced by HA use or by poor speech perception (Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/EANDH/A294). Thus, the presence of sleep difficulties appears to be predicated primarily on whether tinnitus is present or not, and would therefore be expected to occur in a majority of those who experience tinnitus. It is perhaps not surprising therefore that insomnia was identified by patients and clinicians as one of the outstanding priorities for tinnitus research (Hall et al. 2013).  Tinnitus Before and After Implantation The present data cannot provide definitive estimates of the effect of implantation on tinnitus because it is not known whether tinnitus reported as occurring only in the past was abolished before or after implantation. If one assumes reporting moderately or severely distressing tinnitus as “significant” enough to consider additional tinnitus management options after implantation (Andersson et al. 2009), the estimate of 37% of CI users found in the present study (Table 3) would be somewhat higher than the 25% of “clinically significant” tinnitus estimated from data reported in other studies (Baguley 2010). If one also assumes that the candidate group was representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK, then the proportion of patients reporting current tinnitus of any kind (56%) was lower than the average estimate of 80% in CI candidates (lower limit of 67%) extrapolated from results of a number of studies (Baguley & Atlas 2007). One possible explanation for these discrepancies is that the UK Biobank study sampled from the middle-aged UK population (40 to 69 years old) and therefore excluded both younger and older adult CI users and candidates.  Clinical Implications The absence of an association between tinnitus persistence, tinnitus distress, and difficulties with sleep reported here suggests that cochlear implantation may not be an appropriate intervention where the primary motivation is tinnitus suppression for the alleviation of tinnitus-related insomnia. Nevertheless, elevated sleep difficulties remain a significant contributor to perceived tinnitus-related emotional distress, and cases of undiagnosed insomnia may be present among tinnitus patients (Miguel et al. 2014). Insomnia management should therefore still be considered for any patient experiencing tinnitus, including CI users.  The results of the present study suggest that tinnitus is less persistent in those who use a CI compared with those identified as potential candidates for a CI despite similar prevalence of tinnitus in both groups. The results also suggest that the level of tinnitus persistence in CI users is similar to that observed in unaided participants with good speech perception in noise (Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/EANDH/A294). However, the limited information in the UK Biobank study on hearing loss and the type or number of devices used means that uncertainty remains as to whether (a) the difference in tinnitus persistence observed between CI users and potential candidates was a direct result of the devices used and (b) the subset of HA users identified as potential candidates were representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK. If the finding of lower tinnitus persistence among CI users compared with candidates is replicated in further observational and controlled studies, cochlear implantation could be considered as a potential treatment option for persistent and emotionally distressing tinnitus in those whose hearing loss may not otherwise make them a candidate. In those cases, implantation may have the potential to make tinnitus less persistent, possibly leading to a reduction in emotional distress.  The recognized breadth of observed symptoms among tinnitus patients has and continues to drive efforts toward delineating subtypes of tinnitus to provide tailored treatments and improve individual outcomes (Tyler et al. 2008a; Langguth 2011; COST Action BM1306: TINNET 2013). It is somewhat surprising therefore that, in the case of CI users, the focus appears to remain on suppressing the percept of tinnitus (Arts et al. 2012, 2015; Chang & Zeng 2012; Vlastarakos et al. 2014; Ramakers et al. 2015), with relatively less attention given to the characterization and management of other tinnitus-related symptoms. The present results suggest that CI users may experience a relief in tinnitus persistence, but not a complete abolition of tinnitus or tinnitus-related distress. Studies investigating other aspects of tinnitus handicap in CI users are encouraging (e.g., anxiety and depression; Andersson et al. 2009; Olze et al. 2011; Kloostra et al. 2015), but a more comprehensive characterization of tinnitus symptoms is still needed to understand the burden of tinnitus after cochlear implantation. It is only through such understanding that appropriate interventions for alleviating the burden of tinnitus in implant users can be identified and developed.""",Partially,Yes,Yes me,,"""If one also assumes that the candidate group was representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK, then the proportion of patients reporting current tinnitus of any kind (56%) was lower than the average estimate of 80% in CI candidates (lower limit of 67%) extrapolated from results of a number of studies (Baguley & Atlas 2007).

INTRODUCTION Ménière’s disease, a disorder of the inner ear, defined by episodes of vertigo, aural fullness, tinnitus, and sensorineural hearing loss, afflicts hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide (Sajjadi & Paparella 2008). Currently, our understanding of the disease etiology remains obscure. It is a complex multifactorial disease with a range of risk factors implicated including family history (genetic and/or childhood environment) (Gazquez & Lopez-Escamez 2011), viral infection (Williams et al. 1987), allergy (Derebery & Berliner 2010), autoimmunity (Gazquez et al. 2011), and nervous system dysfunction (e.g., migraine; Peroutka 2004) all identified as potential contributory factors (Tyrrell et al. 2014a).  Concomitant diseases and other risk factors such as family history, viral infection, and allergy suggest that early-life exposures may contribute to an individual’s risk of developing Ménière’s. However, to date, very limited information is available on the role of early-life exposure in developing Ménière’s. Furthermore, the Barker Hypothesis may also play a role in disease etiology (Hales et al. 1991). A key proxy for differing exposures in intrauterine, perinatal, and early childhood is adult anthropometric measures, especially leg length. Poor maternal and childhood health, insufficient diet (energy intake was positively associated with leg length; beta 0.0027 [0.0013–0.0041]) (Wadsworth et al. 2002), adverse family circumstances (e.g., socioeconomic status [SES] and overcrowding in early childhood both reduce adult leg length by approximately 10–15 cm; Li et al. 2007), and maternal smoking during pregnancy are each known to reduce leg length, independent of birth weight (Gunnell et al. 1998; Wadsworth et al. 2002; Gunnell et al. 2003; Li et al. 2007).  Numerous studies have demonstrated that taller adults have lower risks of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity (Whitley et al. 2012). Furthermore, studies have indicated that leg length is the main contributor to this association (Gunnell et al. 2003), with trunk length associations, weaker or absent. The mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. The prepubertal linear growth occurs more in the leg than in the trunk (Whitley et al. 2012), and leg length may be a particularly sensitive marker of adverse prepubertal environmental factors that affect growth. Studies have also demonstrated that leg length was sensitive to infant (younger than 5 years) socioeconomic circumstance and diet (Wadsworth et al. 2002). Leg length in childhood is robustly correlated with leg length in adulthood. Shorter leg length has been associated with a number of adulthood diseases including coronary heart disease (CHD) (Lawlor et al. 2004) and type 2 diabetes (Lawlor et al. 2002).

This finding may not be clinically relevant for the treatment of Ménière’s, but our analyses support the importance of the childhood environment (e.g., good nutrition, low burden of disease) in the growth and development of a healthy neurosensory system.""",Yes,Yes,,"""The recruitment strategy of the UK Biobank meant that it is not a representative sample of the British population (borne out by the under-representation of ethnic minorities), and selection criteria also limit it to the 40- to 70-year-old age range.

Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mortality information was obtained from the National Health Service for England and Wales and by the NHS Central Register in Scotland. All details from the death certificate were provided to UK Biobank. Primary cause of death was codified according to ICD10 by trained UK Biobank personnel. We identified the ICD10 codes I00-I99 as CVD-related.  Comorbidities were based on self-report. Specifically, participants were asked to report any illnesses they had and if the participant was uncertain of the type of illness he/she had, they described it to the interviewer (a trained nurse) who attempted to code it. If the illness could not be coded during the interview, the interviewer entered a free-text description, which was subsequently reviewed by a physician and, where possible, matched to codes. Using these codes, cases of self-reported cardiovascular disease, diabetes, other endocrine disorders, neurological disorders, renal disorders respiratory disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, gastrointestinal/abdominal disorders and psychological disorders were identified (see Supplemental Table 1).  Covariates in the model were selected based on the potential to confound associations between chronotype and mortality. These covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status (SES), sleep duration and comorbidities. Age at baseline assessment was calculated in years based on date of birth. Three age bins were defined based on previous analyses of UK Biobank data (Ganna and Ingelsson, 2015): 37-52 years, 53-62 years and 63-73 years. Sex (male/female) and ethnicity were self-identified. Since a large majority of the sample (94%) self-identified as “white”, we dichotomised ethnicity into “white” and “non-white”. Smoking status was obtained by self-report with the following categories: “Never”, “Previous smoker”, “Current smoker”, and “prefer not to answer”. Standing height was measured using a Seca 240cm height measure while participants stood barefoot with posture verified by trained staff. Weight was measured using a Tanita BC418MA body composition analyser and BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2).

The effect size was small (2% increased risk with each level of chronotype); however, this effect size is similar to the effect we observed for BMI, endocrine disorders (excluding diabetes), renal disorders, musculoskeletal disorders and gastrointestinal/abdominal disorders. Further, mortality is a significant clinical outcome and any increase in age-adjusted risk of death warrants attention.

Another strategy to improve health of evening types would be to adjust work schedules to suit individual chronotype. It is also worth noting that daylight savings time (DST)/summer time places a further burden on individuals who are already struggling with the dictates of social norms on when to start the working day, and the switch to DST, which is perceived as more uncomfortable by evening types than by morning types (Nascimento De Alencar et al. 2017; Kantermann et al. 2007), also coincided with greater incidence of cardiovascular events (Jiddou et al. 2013).

Recent data from a large cohort study has shown that WBC was associated with coronary heart disease and cancer mortality among healthy women, even after excluding those with comorbidities (CVDs, connective tissue disease, ulcerative colitis, liver disease, diabetes mellitus, or cancers) and early deaths during follow-up.13 The association of WBC with CVD mortality among women in UK Biobank was fairly weak, but the association of neutrophils with CVD we report was strong in both sexes and is also similar to a recent large cohort study.18 Our sensitivity analysis attenuated associations of circulating leukocyte counts with mortality outcomes. This suggests an element of reverse causality.19 Mechanisms that explain this observation likely include the association between neutrophilia and trauma, stress, bacterial infection, smoking, and indolent cancer,29 any of which ultimately might increase the risk of death from any cause. Likewise, lymphopenia is likely to be caused by old age, viral infection, autoimmune disease, renal failure, and immunosuppressive drugs.30 By excluding those with a range of baseline diseases, and those who develop disease within 2 years of baseline, the present results provide models that limit the effect of baseline disease on counts themselves.  What mechanisms might explain the association of leukocytes with CVD mortality? The inflammatory hypothesis of CVD is well established.31 Underpinning this, cellular atherosclerotic plaques appear more prone to rupture.32 It is hypothesized that leukocytes may play a direct role in destabilizing the plaque itself33,34 through fibrous cap thinning, although it may be that circulating levels of leukocytes do not necessarily reflect resident cells within atherosclerotic plaques. Investigating specific differential counts, our data suggest that high circulating neutrophil levels are linearly associated with CVD mortality that occurs beyond a 2-year time horizon in ostensibly healthy people. The same does not seem to be true of other leukocytes. It is interesting that, until recently, neutrophils were a neglected leukocyte in atherosclerosis research. There are clear mechanisms that might explain why neutrophils might play an important role in causing CVD death.35 Neutrophils interact with cholesterol crystals to produce pro-IL-1ß.20 They can form structures that bind bacteria and platelets, the end result of which is that neutrophils release nuclear material leading to cell death and thrombosis.36 Neutrophils are, therefore, intimately linked to the inflammatory cascade, which can be promoted through a proatherogenic environment. Other environmental factors, such as smoking,37 might also promote neutrophilia and CVD death, resulting in confounding. However, our sensitivity analysis suggests that there may be an independent association too. Inhibiting IL-1ß in patients with established CVD reduces cardiovascular events10,25 and strongly reduces circulating neutrophil counts.26,27 Our findings suggest that further work should be done in patients without preexisting CVD to determine whether IL-1ß blockers, or other modulators of the immune response to inflammation, may have a role to play in the prevention of CVD and the role of neutrophils in this context.  Higher neutrophil counts were also associated with a higher risk of non-CVD death. Here, the association may be even more complex. Specific non-CVD conditions may be linked to higher neutrophil counts through different pathways. For instance, there is evidence that people with chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis have increased risk of death beyond that caused by CVD (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.22752/abstract). There has also been speculation that tumor-infiltrating neutrophils may be important in the prognosis of several types of cancer (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044579X13000138). As noted above, mechanisms that may underlie the associations we observe include the influence of indolent malignancy (both solid organ and hematological) and other confounders such as inflammatory diseases and smoking. Although we corrected for as many of these as possible through multivariable analysis and sensitivity analysis, there remains a significant element of confounding and reverse causality. More work is required to examine the association between neutrophils and specific non-CVD causes of death to determine potential mechanisms underlying our findings.  Our study has many strengths. The UK Biobank includes a wide sample of the UK general population in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status and as such is not derived from health records of patients with a clinical indication for leukocyte measurement, in contrast to prior work.18 Further strengths of the study include its large sample size, comprehensive phenotyping, and simultaneous consideration of differential leukocyte counts derived from a central laboratory measurement, also in contrast to prior work.18 The side-by-side comparison of CVD and non-CVD mortality gives an indication of the specificity of associations, although we did not further subdivide non-CVD morality because of lack of adjudicated outcomes. It is notable that inflammatory markers seem to have a stronger association with CVD mortality than with nonfatal events.38,39 Weaknesses include the lack of data to adjust for lipids, although the extensive adjustment model will capture much of this confounding by proxy. Lack of adjustment for medication is a further limitation, although again adjustment for comorbidity accounts for much of the association. Reverse causality is possible in any observational study, and although our results include a sensitivity analysis and an analysis excluding those with diagnosed comorbidities, we cannot exclude the potential of further reverse causality explaining some of the associations that we report.  In conclusion, we report that among leukocytes, higher neutrophil count is particularly associated with higher CVD risk in a general population. This association seems to be robust in those without comorbidity at baseline or in those who may have unrecognized disease at baseline. Further work is required to determine whether modulation of the immune responses that involve neutrophils, via canakinumab or other interventions, can lead to a reduction in CVD mortality.""",Partially,Yes,Yes me,"""The UK Biobank includes a wide sample of the UK general population in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status and as such is not derived from health records of patients with a clinical indication for leukocyte measurement, in contrast to prior work""  No discussion of generalisability outside of the UK setting",,Partially,No,No me,Yes,Yes,,"The work in this study was supported by a grant from Chest, Heart, and Stroke Association Scotland (Res16/A165).","""The work in this study was supported by a grant from Chest, Heart, and Stroke Association Scotland (Res16/A165).""",No,No,,,,No,No,,,,No,No,,,,10/03/2020 13:35,08/01/2020 15:19,ni,ni,,,,,associationoftotalanddifferentialleukocytecountswithcardiovasculardiseaseandmortalityintheukbiobank,associationoftotalanddifferentialleukocytecountswithcardiovasculardiseaseandmortalityintheukbiobank,associationoftotalanddifferentialleukocytecountswithcardiovasculardiseaseandmortalityintheukbiobank,associationoftotalanddifferentialleukocytecountswithcardiovasculardiseaseandmortalityintheukbiobank,9310,yes_exact,yes_almost,yes_exact,This research was conducted using the UK Biobank resource,"""This research was conducted using the UK Biobank resource""",EN-GB,EN-GB,Never,Never
