There are limited data suggesting that low levels of physical activity are associated with increased hazard of mortality in men and women with low CRF, but that the association between physical activity and mortality may be weaker in those with high CRF.

Currently, physical activity interventions are generally targeted at everyone in the least active sub-group of the population.10 This is based on the overall curvilinear relationship between level of physical activity and all-cause mortality which suggests that the incremental benefit is greatest among those with the lowest baseline level of physical activity.4,11 However, this approach assumes that the association between physical activity and mortality is consistent, irrespective of CRF and strength or other characteristics. If the relationship between physical activity and mortality does differ according to strength and CRF, information on grip strength—which is easily measured—and CRF could help to define better the subgroup of the population who could benefit most from physical activity interventions",Yes,The purpose of this study was therefore to determine whether the associations of physical activity with mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events were influenced by CRF and grip strength among adults enrolled in UK Biobank,Yes,"In this prospective, population-based study,",Yes,"Between April 2007 and December 2010, UK Biobank recruited 502 682 participants (5.5% response rate), aged 40– 69 years from the general population...

",Yes-External," Physical activity Physical activity was based on self-report, using the IPAQ short form, with participants reporting frequency and duration of walking, moderate and vigorous activity undertaken in a typical week.8 Data were analysed in accordance with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) scoring protocol (http://www.ipaq.ki.se/scoring.pdf), and total physical activity was computed as the sum of walking, moderate and vigorous activity, measured as metabolic equivalents (MET-hours/week). Total time spent in sedentary behaviours were derived from the sum of self-reported time spent driving, using computer and watching television (TV).  Physical activity was used in analyses as a continuous variable, and as a categorical variable with participants stratified into age- and sex-specific quintiles as described in Table S7.   Grip strength  Grip strength was assessed using a Jamar J00105 hydraulic hand dynamometer and the mean of the right hand and left hand values, expressed as kg, was used in the analysis. Isometric grip force was assessed from a single 3-second maximal grip effort of the right and left arms with the participant seated upright with their elbow by their side and flexed at 90º so that their forearm was facing forwards and resting on an armrest. The mean of the right and left values, expressed as kg, was used in the analysis. Measurements of grip strength taken with the Jamar dynamometer have evidence for good to excellent (r > 0.80) test–retest reproducibility3 and excellent (r = 0.98) inter-rater reliability.4 A total of 1,612 participants did not complete the grip strength test due to health issues (n=1,254), equipment failure (n=296) or declined performing the test (n=62). Grip strength was used in analyses as a continuous variable, and as a categorical variable with participants stratified into age- and sex-specific tertiles as described in Table S8.    Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) 77,961 participants underwent a 6-minute incremental ramp cycle ergometer test with workload calculated according to age, height, weight, resting heart rate and sex. Heart rate was monitored pre-exercise, throughout activity and during recovery via a 4-lead ECG. The work rate at maximal heart rate was estimated by extrapolating the pre-exercise heart rate (i.e. at work rate zero Watts) and the heart rate and work rate at the end of the test, to the age-predicted maximal heart rate (208 – 0.7 x age5 assuming a linear relationship6 Maximal oxygen uptake (i.e. at maximal heart rate) was estimated from the regression equation for the relationship between work rate and oxygen uptake (oxygen uptake (in ml.kg-1.min-1) = 7 + (10.8 x work rate (in Watts))/body mass (in kg))7 and then expressed in terms of maximal METs (where 1 MET  3.5 ml.kg-1.min-1). 10,252 participants were further excluded from the analysis due to abnormal heart rate records during the exercise test (maximal recorded heart rate <40 beats.min-1 or >220 beats.min-1) or missing data for factors used in the equation to estimate CRF, leaving a final sample of 67,702 available for data analysis. CRF was used in analyses as a continuous variable, and as a categorical variable with participants stratified into age- and sex-specific tertiles as described in Table S9.",NA,,Yes," Socio-demographic and other covariates Area-based socioeconomic status was derived from postcode of residence, using the Townsend deprivation index which is derived from census data on housing, employment, social class and car availability.9 Age was calculated from dates of birth and baseline assessment. Smoking status was categorised into never, former and current smoking. Medical history (physician diagnosis of long-standing illness, stroke, angina, myocardial infarction, hypertension, cancer, diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)) was collected from the self-completed, baseline assessment questionnaire.   Anthropometrics and body composition Height and body weight were measured by trained nurses during the initial assessment centre visit. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as (weight/height2) and the WHO criteria10 to classify BMI into: underweight <18.5, normal weight 18.5-24.9, overweight 25.0-29.9 and obese ≥30.0 kg.m-2. Body composition (body fat and fat free mass) were measured using bio-impedance by trained nurses. Weight and percentage body fat (by bio-impedance) were measured, without shoes or outdoor clothing, using the Tanita BC 418MA body composition analyser. Height was measured, without shoes, using the wall-mounted SECA 240 height measure.

The associations of grip strength, CRF, and total physical activity with all-cause mortality and CVD events were investigated using Cox-proportional hazard models. Two approaches were used. Firstly, separate associations of grip strength, CRF, and physical activity with mortality/CVD events were calculated. Grip strength, CRF, and physical activity were treated as continuous variables and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated per 1 SD difference in fitness, grip strength, and total PA, using age- and sexspecific z-scores. To enable comparability with other reports in the literature, HRs were also calculated for a 5 kg difference in grip strength, 1-MET difference in CRF, and 5-MET-h/week difference in total physical activity. Secondly, joint associations between physical activity, CRF, and mortality/CVD events and physical activity, grip strength, and mortality/ CVD events were calculated. Age- and sex-specific quintiles for physical activity and age- and sex-specific tertile for grip strength and CRF were derived and HRs were calculated, with the referent category comprising individuals who were in both the highest quintile of physical activity and the strongest/fittest tertile. ... For each of the approaches described above, we ran four incremental models that included an increasing number of covariates: ‘model 0’ included age, sex; ‘model 1’ included age, sex, ethnicity (white, black South Asian, Chinese, and other), smoking status (current, former, and never), BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese), deprivation index and alcohol intake as covariates; ‘model 2’ also adjusted for depression, stroke, angina, heart attack, hypertension, cancer, diabetes, or long-standing illness; and ‘model 3’ also adjusted for total sedentary time per day, as well as total physical activity per day and grip strength as appropriate. Finally, ‘model 4’ was equivalent to ‘model 2’ but participants with a history of cancer, stroke, angina, or myocardial infarction at baseline were excluded from the analysis. Cardiorespiratory fitness was not included as a covariate in the models for physical activity or grip strength because data on CRF were only available for 14% (n ¼ 67 702) of the UK Biobank cohort. The proportional hazard assumption was checked by tests based on Schoenfeld residuals. All analyses were performed using STATA 14 statistical software (StataCorp LP).",No,"To investigate whether CRF and/or grip strength moderated the association between physical activity and mortality/CVD events, we also tested the statistical significance of interaction terms and conducted sub-group analyses where appropriate.",Yes,see 12_b_i,Partially,"10,252 participants were further excluded from the analysis due to abnormal heart rate records during the exercise test (maximal recorded heart rate <40 beats.min-1 or >220 beats.min-1) or missing data for factors used in the equation to estimate CRF, leaving a final sample of 67,702 available for data analysis",No,,,,,,No,,Yes,"Our sample was restricted to the 498 135 participants who had valid data on mortality status at follow-up and baseline data for at least one of the following: grip strength, physical activity, and CRF.

There was a statistically significant interaction between physical activity and grip strength with mortality with the HR per quintile change in physical activity being almost three times as great in those low compared with high grip strength. A similar pattern was observed for CRF, but the interaction was not statistically significant. Figure 2 and Supplementary material online, Table S6 show the same data for CVD events. Here a significant increase in CVD events with decreasing physical activity was only observed in those in the lowest tertile for grip strength or CRF. There was a statistically significant interaction between physical activity and grip strength with CVD events. When the sensitivity analyses were performed following exclusion of all participants with a history of cancer, stroke, angina, or heart attack from the analysis, the findings were not substantially altered (Table 1; Supplementary material online, Table S5, model 4). Similarly, when first year follow-up events were removed from the analysis, the results were not altered.",Yes,"The main finding of this study is that the association of physical activity with mortality and CVD events is moderated by grip strength and possibly CRF. Grip strength and CRF were moderately correlated with each other, but both had weak correlations with selfreported physical activity: all three factors were associated with mortality, independent of each other, and potential confounders. The associations between grip strength (HR of 1.35 per SD difference) and CRF (HR 1.29) with mortality were of similar magnitude and were both stronger than the association physical activity (HR 1.15) and mortality in the group overall. However, although physical activity was inversely associated with all-cause mortality in all levels of grip strength and those with low and middle CRF, the association was strongest in those with the lowest strength, and possibly lowest CRF, suggesting that these sub-groups would potentially benefit most from interventions aimed at increasing physical activity. For CVD events, significant increases in risk with decreasing physical activity were only evident in those with the lowest strength or lowest CRF. The evidence is stronger in relation to grip strength which could be easily measured in clinical practice and, therefore, may be a useful method of identifying a high risk group and targeting interventions accordingly.",Yes,"Although the response rate to UK Biobank was only 5.5%, the UK Biobank cohort is representative of the general population with respect to age, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation within the age range recruited, although it is not representative in other regards.12 While this limits the ability to generalize prevalence rates, estimates of the magnitude of associations regarding disease or mortality risk in the current study will not be affected by this and will therefore be generalizable.12,28 Reverse causality is possible in any observational study; however, when all participants with existing disease were removed from the analysis the effect and direction of the association remained significant. Although existing disease and comorbidities present before the UK Biobank measurement day were self-reported, these self-reported records were based on disease that had been medically diagnosed. Data for atrial fibrillation and heart failure were not explicitly reported as separate conditions in the dataset at baseline, but these conditions are likely to have been captured in the ‘long-standing illness’ variable that we adjusted for in our models. Thus, any potential confounding effects of these conditions would have been largely captured in our statistical adjustments. Endpoint determination for CVD events was based only on ICD-10 codes and was not subject to further scientific adjudication. Physical activity was measured by self-report using a validated questionnaire. Thus misreporting of activity levels may have attenuated the association between physical activity and mortality compared with objective physical activity measurement.29 However, this is unlikely to have substantially confounded the differential influence of physical activity on mortality risk across the grip strength and CRF groups, unless the extent misreporting of physical activity was systematically higher in the high CRF and high grip strength groups, where the effects of physical activity on mortality were least strong. Cardiorespiratory fitness data were only available in 14% of participants, although this sub-group was representative of the wider cohort (see Supplementary material online, Tables S1 and S2). However, the absence of a significant interaction between CRF and physical activity with mortality—despite similar trends to those for the grip strength and physical activity with mortality—may reflect a lack of statistical power to detect effect in this smaller sample. As dietary intake data were only available for around half of the cohort (n ¼ 211 066), we did not include this as covariate in our models. Alcohol intake was available for the entire cohort and we did adjust for this; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that other that dietary factors could have influence our findings.",Yes,see 19_i,Yes,"In conclusion, insufficient physical activity is a preventable contributor to the global burden of morbidity and mortality. However, to maximize potential public health gains population-level interventions to encourage physical activity in the whole population could be complemented by specific interventions targeted at the sub-group of the population who are at highest risk. Cardiorespiratory fitness and strength are both predictors of all-cause mortality and CVD events independent of physical activity. Our results suggest that the ability of physical activity to reduce hazard of death or CVD events may be greatest among those with low baseline strength and fitness. Current guidelines advocate targeting physical activity interventions merely on the basis of current levels of physical activity. Our findings suggest that targeting on the basis of strength, and possibly fitness, could greatly improve our ability to identify those individuals who could benefit most, thereby increasing the clinical and cost effectiveness of physical activity interventions. These conclusions require testing in the context of a future randomized controlled trial.",Yes,see 19_i,No,,No,,Yes,"Funding The UK Biobank was supported by the Wellcome Trust, Medical Research Council, Department of Health, Scottish Government, and the Northwest Regional Development Agency.
