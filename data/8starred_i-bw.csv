Lyall2016hort2154,Low birth weight and features of neuroticism and mood disorder in 83 545 participants of the UK Biobank cohort,Yes,"""All participants attended 1 of 22 assessment centres. Participants were asked to report their birth weight (either in kilograms directly, or in pounds and ounces and converted to kilograms to two decimal points) and whether they had any physical disorders, including hypertension, heart/cardiac problems, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and osteoporosis. Participants self-reported whether their mothers had ever had MDD (at any time), and whether their mothers smoked around the time of pregnancy. We coded â€˜Whiteâ€™ ethnicity for participants who reported themselves at assessment as â€˜Whiteâ€™, â€˜White-Britishâ€™, â€˜White-Irishâ€™ or â€˜Any other White backgroundâ€™, 13 and Black and minority ethnic for the remainder. Townsend scores were obtained from postcode of residence. They are an area-based index of socioeconomic deprivation derived from census data on car ownership, household overcrowding, owner-occupation and unemployment. 14 Higher Townsend scores equate to greater socioeconomic deprivation.  Neuroticism was assessed with 12 questions from the Eysenck Personality Inventory Neuroticism scale - Revised (EPIN-R 15,16 ) and the 172 751 participants recruited in the past 2 years were asked to provide more detailed information on lifetime experience of mood disorder features and were grouped into probable MDD or probable BD (or not) based on a structured classification which we have previously described in detail. 16 Briefly, current and past depressive features were assessed by items relating to lifetime experience of minor/major depression, items from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and items related to mental health help-seeking. 16,17 Probable history of BD was based on questions in the baseline self-report assessment which were analogous to questions within the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID-1 18 ). If participants had probable BD and also probable MDD, they were classified as BD only."""
Pierz2016tion0341,Tinnitus and Sleep Difficulties After Cochlear Implantation,Yes,"""Self-Reported Measures UK Biobank participants completed a touchscreen questionnaire. All participants were asked questions on sleep problems, hearing device use, hearing difficulties, and tinnitus. The selected questions and response options are listed in Table 1. The responses characterized when participants reported experiencing tinnitus (â€œtinnitus presenceâ€) and its frequency of occurrence (â€œtinnitus persistenceâ€). Participants who indicated that they have experienced tinnitus at some point also judged the level of â€œtinnitus distressâ€ similar to the assessment of tinnitus-related emotional distress in standard tinnitus questionnaires (Kuk et al. 1990; Meikle et al. 2012). The self-report question on sleep difficulties was the same as that often included in standard tinnitus questionnaires (Kuk et al. 1990; Newman et al. 1996; Meikle et al. 2012; Tyler et al. 2014). However, it was asked before the tinnitus assessments in the UK Biobank study and therefore responses on sleep difficulties may not be related specifically to tinnitus.  Speech in Noise Test Participants completed a shortened version of the Digit Triplets Test (DTT, Dawes et al. 2014) at the UK Biobank assessment center after completing the touchscreen questionnaire. The DTT was not administered to any participant reporting CI use, regardless of whether they also reported using a hearing aid (HA) or not. Participants who did not use a CI but who wore HAs did complete the DTT but were asked to remove their aids for the assessment. The stimuli were presented separately to each ear via circumaural headphones (Sennheiser D25) at a comfortable level set by the participant. Fifteen monosyllabic digit triplets (e.g., 1-3-9) were presented in noise that was spectrally shaped to match the complete set of nine digits (0 to 9, excluding 7). The level of the noise was varied adaptively to estimate the signal to noise ratio at which the participant could report all three digits in the triplet correctly on 50% of the trials. The mean signal to noise ratio from the last eight triplets was used as a measure of hearing disability and is referred to as the speech reception threshold (SRT).  Comparison Group A â€œcandidateâ€ group for cochlear implantation was selected by relating the available data in the UK Biobank to the UK candidacy criteria for cochlear implantation in adults. The criteria not only require impairment to hearing sensitivity (i.e., unaided pure-tone thresholds >90 dB at 2 and 4 kHz) but also an impaired speech perception (only able to report less than 50% of words in sentences in the best-aided condition, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 2009). As the UK Biobank did not assess hearing sensitivity directly, self-reported use of a HA â€œmost of the timeâ€ was assumed to be an indicator of a clinically diagnosed hearing loss. In addition, only those HA users with SRTs =0 dB on the DTT were included in the candidate group because it would be atypical for cochlear implantation candidates to have a negative SRT in an unaided speech in noise test such as the DTT (Donaldson et al. 2009). Participants with an SRT of +8 dB (the maximum possible value) were excluded to avoid the inclusion of any participants whose DTT results could possibly be attributed to noncompliance or equipment failure.""

Tyrre2015bank0132,"Associations of Leg Length, Trunk Length, and Total Adult Height With MÃ©niÃ¨re's: Cross-Sectional Analysis in the UK Biobank",Partially,"Don't explain source of ethnicity or education ""MÃ©niÃ¨reâ€™s Diagnosis During a nurse-led interview, all participants in the UK Biobank were asked what doctor-diagnosed health conditions they experienced from. The nurse then recorded the disease(s) reported in a predetermined list. If the participant was uncertain about an illness, the condition was described to the interviewer who attempted to place it within the list, with the help of a doctor if necessary. There were several options for ear/vestibular disorders: tinnitus, vertigo, labyrinthitis, MÃ©niÃ¨reâ€™s disease, otosclerosis, or a generic ear/vestibular disorder. We selected all individuals who had reported having MÃ©niÃ¨reâ€™s (n = 1376). While self-reported, we anticipate that our MÃ©niÃ¨reâ€™s variable is valid as these individuals reported current tinnitus and hearing loss (Tyrrell et al. 2014a). Furthermore, the majority participants who recorded Meniereâ€™s disease also recorded a prescription of betahistine and vestibular sedatives at the time of the UK Biobank baseline questionnaire, reflecting the current UK prescribing practice for MÃ©niÃ¨reâ€™s and they also reported avoiding salt, caffeine, and alcohol, which is common clinical advice for individuals with MÃ©niÃ¨reâ€™s (Tyrrell et al. 2014a).  The controls were all individuals who did not report MÃ©niÃ¨reâ€™s.  Diabetes and CHD Participants were defined as having type 2 diabetes if they had answered yes to the question â€œHas a doctor ever told you that you have diabetes?â€ and had not reported using insulin within the first year of diagnosis. We excluded individuals who reported that they were diagnosed under the age of 35 to limit the numbers of individuals with slow-progressing autoimmune diabetes or monogenic forms of diabetes. CHD was defined as a self-reported diagnosis of angina, heart attack, or heart failure.  Components of Adult Height Standing and sitting height (trunk length) variables were available in the UK Biobank for 496,318 participants. Standing and seated heights were measured using a Seca 202 device (Seca, UK). We excluded individuals defined by classic criteria to be of small stature (height <148 cm; n = 1573) (Vance et al. 2012). We then calculated leg length (total height minus trunk length) and leg-to-trunk ratio. We further excluded 261 participants with leg length greater than 120 cm and less than 60 cm. We then created quintiles of the different height components and z scores for each component of height for all participants with full data available (1,327 MÃ©niÃ¨reâ€™s sufferers and 479,500 controls).  Birth Weight Self-reported birth weight was available within the UK Biobank for 277,261 participants. The validity of the self-reported variable has been reported previously (Tyrrell et al. 2014b). We excluded 7,625 individuals who reported being part of a multiple birth, the 2,495 individuals who failed to report whether they were part of a multiple birth, and the 21,262 individuals who reported weighing less than 2500 g at birth. In the absence of gestational age data, it is likely that individuals weighing less than 2500 g at birth were born prematurely.  SES in Childhood The UK Biobank has location of home town at birth for 444,853 participants. We used these data and matched the location of birth data to lower super output areas (LSOAs) using ArcGIS. We then merged the 2009 LSOA data from England which contained the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) for each area (Public Health England Data). Data were available for 378,459 participants within the UK Biobank and 1,140 individuals with MÃ©niÃ¨reâ€™s.2"""
vonSc2018hort4458,"Associations between chronotype, morbidity and mortality in the UK Biobank cohort",Yes,"""Our primary exposure variable was chronotype, which in the UK Biobank questionnaire was assessed through a single question that asked, â€œDo you consider yourself to beâ€ with the four options (in addition to â€œDo not knowâ€): â€œdefinitely a morning personâ€ (definite morning types), â€œmore a morning than evening personâ€ (moderate morning types), â€œmore an evening than a morning personâ€ (moderate evening types), and â€œdefinitely an evening personâ€ (definite evening types). This question is very similar to the last question of the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) (Horne and Ostberg, 1976), which asks, â€œOne hears about â€˜morningâ€™ and â€˜eveningâ€™ types of people. Which ONE of these types do you consider yourself to be?â€ and had the response options â€œDefinitely a â€˜morningâ€™ type, Rather more a â€˜morningâ€™ than an â€˜eveningâ€™ type, Rather more an â€˜eveningâ€™ type than a â€˜morningâ€™ type, Definitely an â€˜eveningâ€™ typeâ€.  Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mortality information was obtained from the National Health Service for England and Wales and by the NHS Central Register in Scotland. All details from the death certificate were provided to UK Biobank. Primary cause of death was codified according to ICD10 by trained UK Biobank personnel. We identified the ICD10 codes I00-I99 as CVD-related.  Comorbidities were based on self-report. Specifically, participants were asked to report any illnesses they had and if the participant was uncertain of the type of illness he/she had, they described it to the interviewer (a trained nurse) who attempted to code it. If the illness could not be coded during the interview, the interviewer entered a free-text description, which was subsequently reviewed by a physician and, where possible, matched to codes. Using these codes, cases of self-reported cardiovascular disease, diabetes, other endocrine disorders, neurological disorders, renal disorders respiratory disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, gastrointestinal/abdominal disorders and psychological disorders were identified (see Supplemental Table 1).  Covariates in the model were selected based on the potential to confound associations between chronotype and mortality. These covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status (SES), sleep duration and comorbidities. Age at baseline assessment was calculated in years based on date of birth. Three age bins were defined based on previous analyses of UK Biobank data (Ganna and Ingelsson, 2015): 37-52 years, 53-62 years and 63-73 years. Sex (male/female) and ethnicity were self-identified. Since a large majority of the sample (94%) self-identified as â€œwhiteâ€, we dichotomised ethnicity into â€œwhiteâ€ and â€œnon-whiteâ€. Smoking status was obtained by self-report with the following categories: â€œNeverâ€, â€œPrevious smokerâ€, â€œCurrent smokerâ€, and â€œprefer not to answerâ€. Standing height was measured using a Seca 240cm height measure while participants stood barefoot with posture verified by trained staff. Weight was measured using a Tanita BC418MA body composition analyser and BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). SES was based on the Townsend deprivation index (Townsend et al., 1988), which was calculated immediately prior to participants joining UK Biobank and was based on the preceding national census output areas. Each participant was assigned a score based on their postcode."""
Welsh2018bank0945,Association of Total and Differential Leukocyte Counts With Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality in the UK Biobank,Partially-External,"""Baseline biological measurements were recorded, and touchscreen questionnaires were administered, as described elsewhere.1,2 UK Biobank received ethical approval from the North West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee (REC reference: 11/NW/03820). All participants gave written informed consent before enrollment in the study, which was conducted in accord with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.  Smoking status was categorized into never, former, or current smoking. Ethnicity was coded as white, South Asian, black, or mixed/other, with white as the referent group. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as (weight in kilograms per height in square meter). Area-based socioeconomic status was derived from postcode of residence, using the Townsend score.3 WBCs were measured on fresh samples as an absolute number per unit volume, and their component leukocytes (lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) as absolute measures and proportions of the overall WBC; all using an automated, clinically validated, Coulter LH 750. Calibration and quality control were performed in line with the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations. Further details of these measurements can be found in the UK Biobank online showcase and protocol (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk).  Specific baseline comorbidities of interest were self-reported CVD (myocardial infraction, angina, stroke or transient ischemic attack), diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation or flutter. A category of other baseline comorbidities potentially associated with inflammation was defined as any of self-reported baseline diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease, heart failure, any malignancy, dementia, Parkinson disease, psoriasis or eczema, osteoporosis, polyarthropathies and systemic connective tissue disorders (other than rheumatoid arthritis), multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic liver disease, endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, diverticular disease of the intestine, hypertension, depression, painful conditions, asthma, treated dyspepsia, thyroid disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome, alcohol problems, other psychoactive substance abuse, treated constipation, prostate disorders, glaucoma, epilepsy, migraines, chronic sinusitis, anorexia or bulimia, anxiety and other neurotic or stress-related disorders, schizophrenia, viral hepatitis, bronchiectasis, MÃ©niÃ¨re disease, and pernicious anemia.  Date and cause of death were obtained from death certificates held by the National Health Service Information Centre for participants from England and Wales and the National Health Service Central Register Scotland for participants from Scotland. There were 3 outcomes of interest in the current study; all-cause mortality, death related to CVD (primary cause of death including ICD-10 codes I20-I23, I24.1, I25.2 and I60-I64) and death unrelated to CVD (any ICD-10 codes excluding I00-I99). We also examined the association between WBC and nonfatal CVD outcomes. Nonfatal outcomes (codes I20-I23, I24.1, I25.2 and I60-I64) were ascertained from hospitalization records using record linkage to national hospitalization data. End of follow-up for the main study for each participant was recorded as the date of death or the date of end of follow-up for the assessment center attended (30/11/2015 for Scottish centers, 31/01/2016 for English or Welsh centers), whichever came first. End of follow-up for the nonfatal events analysis was the date of admission of the first CVD hospitalization or the date of end of follow-up for the assessment center attended, or the date of death, whichever came first. The period at risk per participant began on the date of their assessment. Participants who were hospitalized within 30 days of their assessment were excluded."""
