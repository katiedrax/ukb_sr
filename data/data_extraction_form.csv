Design: The study was conducted using the UK Biobank resource, a population-based cohort of 40- to 69-year olds. Self-report data on hearing, tinnitus, sleep difficulties, and demographic variables were collected from cochlear implant users (n = 194) and individuals identified as potential candidates for cochlear implantation (n = 211). These “candidates” were selected based on (i) impaired hearing sensitivity, inferred from self-reported hearing aid use and (ii) impaired hearing function, inferred from an inability to report words accurately at negative signal to noise ratios on an unaided closed-set test of speech perception. Data on tinnitus (presence, persistence, and related distress) and on sleep difficulties were analyzed using logistic regression models controlling for gender, age, deprivation, and neuroticism.""",Yes,"""Results: The prevalence of tinnitus was similar among implant users (50%) and candidates (52%; p = 0.39). However, implant users were less likely to report that their tinnitus was distressing at its worst (41%) compared with candidates (63%; p = 0.02). The logistic regression model suggested that this difference between the two groups could be explained by the fact that tinnitus was less persistent in implant users (46%) compared with candidates (72%; p < 0.001). Self-reported difficulties with sleep were similar among implant users (75%) and candidates (82%; p = 0.28), but participants with tinnitus were more likely to report sleep difficulties than those without (p < 0.001). The prevalence of sleep difficulties was not related to tinnitus persistence (p = 0.28) or the extent to which tinnitus was distressing (p = 0.55). Conclusions: The lack of association between tinnitus persistence and sleep difficulties is compatible with the notion that tinnitus is suppressed in implant users primarily during active electrical stimulation and may return when the implant is switched off at night time. This explanation is supported by the similar prevalence of sleep problems among implant users and potential candidates for cochlear implantation, despite differences between the groups in tinnitus persistence and related emotional distress. Cochlear implantation may therefore not be an appropriate intervention where the primary aim is to alleviate sleep difficulties""",Yes,"""Introduction Tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of an external stimulus, affects about 16% of the adult population (Dawes et al. 2014; McCormack et al. 2014). Hearing loss has been established as a major risk factor for tinnitus (Nondahl et al. 2011). It has been suggested that degraded auditory input due to cochlear damage can trigger aberrant neuronal activity that is interpreted as tinnitus (Preece et al. 2003; Eggermont & Roberts 2014). The burden imposed by tinnitus is complex and extends beyond the persistence of the percept itself. The overall perceived handicap can include hearing difficulties, anxiety, depression, inability to relax, and sleep difficulties (Tyler & Baker 1983; Langguth 2011; McCormack et al. 2015). This heterogeneity in symptoms is reflected in the wide variety of proposed treatments, many of which are not supported by strong evidence for their effectiveness (Baguley et al. 2013).  Patients and clinicians agree that the management of tinnitus in those with profound hearing loss remains one of the top priorities for future tinnitus research (Hall et al. 2013). One potential device that has been proposed to manage tinnitus in the profoundly deaf is the cochlear implant (CI), which is an established intervention to restore useful aspects of hearing in these patients (Faulkner & Pisoni 2013). Cochlear implantation involves the surgical placement of an electrode array within the cochlea to stimulate spiral ganglion cells electrically to convey auditory information (Loizou 1998). On average, as many as 80% of candidates for cochlear implantation report experiencing tinnitus but the percept appears to subside in many after implantation (Baguley & Atlas 2007). As a result, it has been suggested that cochlear implantation should be considered as a treatment for tinnitus in the profoundly deaf (Tyler et al. 2008b). However, there remains a lack of comprehensive assessments of the burden of tinnitus and tinnitus-related symptoms after cochlear implantation (Baguley 2010) and therefore a lack of evidence for which symptoms may or may not be alleviated by implantation.  Many studies that have evaluated the impact of cochlear implantation on tinnitus have assessed outcome in terms of relief from the percept, for example, the reduction in tinnitus loudness (for a review see Baguley & Atlas 2007; Arts et al. 2012). Other studies have focused on designing and optimizing electrical stimulation strategies to suppress the percept (Chang & Zeng 2012; Arts et al. 2015). The assumption is that the suppression of tinnitus will alleviate its intrusiveness and reduce overall burden. However, although the number of profoundly deaf patients reporting tinnitus decreases following implantation, clinical observations suggest that a large proportion of CI recipients still experience some degree of tinnitus-related handicap (Pan et al. 2009; Bovo et al. 2011; Kloostra et al. 2015; Ramakers et al. 2015). A review of studies that have assessed the levels of tinnitus-related handicap following implantation suggested that about 25% of CI users experience a clinically significant tinnitus, that is, a degree of tinnitus-related handicap that may warrant intervention (Baguley 2010).  The presence of tinnitus after implantation may be explained by the finding that tinnitus is suppressed mostly when the implant is stimulating the auditory nerve and often reverts back to its original loudness (or becomes louder) soon after stimulation is turned off (Zeng et al. 2011; Vlastarakos et al. 2014). Therefore, it is plausible that tinnitus could be still bothersome in CI users at night time if the CI is switched off before going to sleep (Chadha et al. 2009), and consequently that they would not experience a reduction in the occurrence of tinnitus-related insomnia. However, despite the decades of research and converging evidence that sleep difficulties are one of the most common tinnitus-related complaints (Tyler & Baker 1983; Langguth 2011), the treatment of tinnitus-related insomnia remains an outstanding uncertainty for both clinicians and patients (Hall et al. 2013).Few studies have assessed the association between tinnitus and sleep difficulties in CI users, or whether the presence of tinnitus leads to sleep difficulties after patients turn their CI off at night time. One observational study on a small sample of adult CI users has suggested that implant use may reduce sleep difficulties in some, but not all, patients (Di Nardo et al. 2007), but the factors that contribute to that reduction remain unclear.""",Yes,"""Few studies have assessed the association between tinnitus and sleep difficulties in CI users, or whether the presence of tinnitus leads to sleep difficulties after patients turn their CI off at night time.

Further analyses revealed that this group difference was driven by the lower persistence of their tinnitus (Fig. 3): participants who reported tinnitus as less persistent were more likely to report a lower level of emotional distress as a result of their tinnitus. These results are compatible with previous studies that have demonstrated the potential for electrical stimulation to reduce the percept of tinnitus (for a review, see Baguley & Atlas 2007).  Tinnitus still appears to cause considerable distress in a subset of implanted individuals. However, the data available in the UK Biobank were mostly retrospective and based on self-report and may not accurately reflect participants’ overall level of tinnitus-related distress. The self-reports of CI users might have been influenced by their experience of hearing restoration and/or by the hearing and speech therapy they received following implantation (Pan et al. 2009). However, the lack of general quality of life assessments did not allow for these or other potential psychological effects on well-being and reported tinnitus persistence or distress to be controlled for. While tinnitus can be experienced throughout the day, participants in the UK Biobank were only asked to judge their level of tinnitus-related distress during the periods when their tinnitus is at its worst, for example, when their CI is switched off. If so, the present results may overstate the overall level of distress experienced by CI users. If distress had been measured throughout the day, the difference in distress reported by the CI and candidate groups may have been even more pronounced.  One possible explanation for the lower level of tinnitus persistence among CI users is that they may have regained access to sound following implantation that could suppress or mask their tinnitus and/or reduce the extent to which they attend to their tinnitus. These effects could plausibly lead to a decrease in the perceived loudness of tinnitus and potentially give some relief from tinnitus-related emotional distress. However, neither suppression nor reduced attention to tinnitus may be fully effective or lasting if only due to the fact that currently CI stimulation is optimized for speech perception and may not be optimal for the suppression of tinnitus (Chang & Zeng 2012). Thus, many CI users will likely still experience periods of loud and distressing tinnitus as they did before implantation.  Sleep Difficulties The overall prevalence of tinnitus and sleep difficulties was similar in both the CI and candidate groups.

Questions about sleep in the UK Biobank study were not asked in the context of tinnitus. Therefore, the reported difficulties with sleep may have been unrelated to tinnitus but related to other factors, for example, other age-related health problems. However, self-reported difficulties with sleep were highly prevalent in all participants reporting current tinnitus. This association between tinnitus presence and sleep difficulties was found even after controlling for neuroticism, a factor shown to be associated with both tinnitus (McCormack et al. 2014, 2015) and sleep problems (Hintsanen et al. 2014).  Sleep difficulties did not vary as a function of either tinnitus persistence or distress. This finding is consistent with the fact that participants were asked to rate distress based on how much the tinnitus “noises” upset them. Consequently, the reported distress was likely driven by hearing tinnitus persistently (Fig. 3) rather than sleep problems. Additional analyses also determined that the prevalence of sleep difficulties was not influenced by HA use or by poor speech perception (Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/EANDH/A294). Thus, the presence of sleep difficulties appears to be predicated primarily on whether tinnitus is present or not, and would therefore be expected to occur in a majority of those who experience tinnitus. It is perhaps not surprising therefore that insomnia was identified by patients and clinicians as one of the outstanding priorities for tinnitus research (Hall et al. 2013).  Tinnitus Before and After Implantation The present data cannot provide definitive estimates of the effect of implantation on tinnitus because it is not known whether tinnitus reported as occurring only in the past was abolished before or after implantation. If one assumes reporting moderately or severely distressing tinnitus as “significant” enough to consider additional tinnitus management options after implantation (Andersson et al. 2009), the estimate of 37% of CI users found in the present study (Table 3) would be somewhat higher than the 25% of “clinically significant” tinnitus estimated from data reported in other studies (Baguley 2010). If one also assumes that the candidate group was representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK, then the proportion of patients reporting current tinnitus of any kind (56%) was lower than the average estimate of 80% in CI candidates (lower limit of 67%) extrapolated from results of a number of studies (Baguley & Atlas 2007).

Clinical Implications The absence of an association between tinnitus persistence, tinnitus distress, and difficulties with sleep reported here suggests that cochlear implantation may not be an appropriate intervention where the primary motivation is tinnitus suppression for the alleviation of tinnitus-related insomnia. Nevertheless, elevated sleep difficulties remain a significant contributor to perceived tinnitus-related emotional distress, and cases of undiagnosed insomnia may be present among tinnitus patients (Miguel et al. 2014). Insomnia management should therefore still be considered for any patient experiencing tinnitus, including CI users.  The results of the present study suggest that tinnitus is less persistent in those who use a CI compared with those identified as potential candidates for a CI despite similar prevalence of tinnitus in both groups. The results also suggest that the level of tinnitus persistence in CI users is similar to that observed in unaided participants with good speech perception in noise (Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/EANDH/A294). However, the limited information in the UK Biobank study on hearing loss and the type or number of devices used means that uncertainty remains as to whether (a) the difference in tinnitus persistence observed between CI users and potential candidates was a direct result of the devices used and (b) the subset of HA users identified as potential candidates were representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK. If the finding of lower tinnitus persistence among CI users compared with candidates is replicated in further observational and controlled studies, cochlear implantation could be considered as a potential treatment option for persistent and emotionally distressing tinnitus in those whose hearing loss may not otherwise make them a candidate. In those cases, implantation may have the potential to make tinnitus less persistent, possibly leading to a reduction in emotional distress.  The recognized breadth of observed symptoms among tinnitus patients has and continues to drive efforts toward delineating subtypes of tinnitus to provide tailored treatments and improve individual outcomes (Tyler et al. 2008a; Langguth 2011; COST Action BM1306: TINNET 2013). It is somewhat surprising therefore that, in the case of CI users, the focus appears to remain on suppressing the percept of tinnitus (Arts et al. 2012, 2015; Chang & Zeng 2012; Vlastarakos et al. 2014; Ramakers et al. 2015), with relatively less attention given to the characterization and management of other tinnitus-related symptoms. The present results suggest that CI users may experience a relief in tinnitus persistence, but not a complete abolition of tinnitus or tinnitus-related distress. Studies investigating other aspects of tinnitus handicap in CI users are encouraging (e.g., anxiety and depression; Andersson et al. 2009; Olze et al. 2011; Kloostra et al. 2015), but a more comprehensive characterization of tinnitus symptoms is still needed to understand the burden of tinnitus after cochlear implantation. It is only through such understanding that appropriate interventions for alleviating the burden of tinnitus in implant users can be identified and developed.""",Yes,"""If one also assumes that the candidate group was representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK, then the proportion of patients reporting current tinnitus of any kind (56%) was lower than the average estimate of 80% in CI candidates (lower limit of 67%) extrapolated from results of a number of studies (Baguley & Atlas 2007). One possible explanation for these discrepancies is that the UK Biobank study sampled from the middle-aged UK population (40 to 69 years old) and therefore excluded both younger and older adult CI users and candidates.""",Yes,"""This research was funded by infrastructure funding from the UK National Institute of Health Research.

A previous study analysed the dietary intake in people consuming a reduced-carbohydrate diet (<40% calories). However, it is not clear what foods people consume when carbohydrate is reduced to below 26% of total calories. Methods: In the present cross-sectional study, the dietary and nutrient intake collected via up to five consecutive 24-h dietary recalls and a food frequency questionnaire of 444 individuals (aged 46-79 years) consuming <26% of calories from carbohydrate (LCHO) was compared with that of 131 897 individuals consuming ≥45% calories from carbohydrate (NCHO) using the UK Biobank Dataset.

Both LCHO groups reported consuming significantly more red meat, oily fish, nuts and seeds but fewer fruits, vegetables and pulses compared to the NCHO groups. In general, the consumption of oily fish, nuts, seeds and pulses was low across the whole cohort and differences in intake between the LCHO and NCHO groups were small. After adjusting for socio-economic status, most differences remained. Conclusions: Carbohydrate restriction is associated with both beneficial and potentially deleterious dietary changes compared to a normal carbohydrate intake.""",Yes,"""Introduction Low‐carbohydrate diets (LCHO) are becoming increasingly popular. In the UK, it was reported that 3 million people had tried the LCHO diet in 2003 1, with the Atkins diet books alone having sold over 45 million books in the latter half of the 20th century 2. Carbohydrate (CHO) restriction, where the restriction is sufficient and adhered to 3-5, appears to confer particular metabolic benefits for the management of type 2 diabetes 4, 6, including a reduction in post‐prandial glycaemia. However, the long‐term health effects in the wider population are not clear. This raises questions of its long‐term safety and efficacy, which warrants ongoing investigation into the dietary habits of such individuals 7, 8.  It is important to note that there is no singular definition of what constitutes a LCHO diet, although a CHO content comprising <26% of calories (or <130 g CHO) has been suggested as a cut‐off 9. Variations of the LCHO diet differ in their permitted levels of macronutrients, such as the low‐carbohydrate, high‐fat diet, which emphasises the importance of increasing fat consumption 10, whereas others increase protein to a greater degree 11. Absolute intakes (i.e. additional grammes) of protein or fat may not increase at all, mirroring a low calorie diet as a result of a reduced overall intake 12. The replacing food or macronutrient may also be an important determinant of the health effects of LCHO diets 4, 7, 8. However, most of the data on food and nutrient consumption in a LCHO diet have been collected in clinical trials 5-8, where participants are instructed to follow a particular dietary pattern. Therefore, to determine nutritional adequacy, it is important to establish what free‐living individuals on a CHO‐restricted diet are consuming.  A recent study compared the dietary intakes of individuals consuming fewer than 40% of calories from CHO with those who were consuming ≥40% in the UK. Although people on a reduced‐CHO diet consumed more red and processed meat and fewer fruits compared to those on a normal‐CHO diet, they also consumed more oily fish and vegetables 13. Therefore, CHO restriction may be associated with both healthy and less‐healthy dietary choices. A weakness of the study was the high cut‐off used to define the LCHO group with the aim of generating a sufficient number of subjects from the limited data available.""",Yes,"""A recent study compared the dietary intakes of individuals consuming fewer than 40% of calories from CHO with those who were consuming ≥40% in the UK.

A weakness of the study was the high cut‐off used to define the LCHO group with the aim of generating a sufficient number of subjects from the limited data available. A lower boundary would be more likely to produce a group of individuals intentionally reducing their CHO intake and thus produce a more accurate representation of dietary and nutrient consumption. To identify sufficient numbers of people consuming a LCHO, a large sample size is required. The UK Biobank contains dietary and anthropometric data for more than 500 000 people.

We examined the number of 24‐h dietary recalls for the LCHO and the NCHO groups, and sensitivity analyses were run including only those people with more than one 24‐h dietary recall completed.

There is no agreed definition for a LCHO diet, although <26% kcal has been proposed as a cut‐off9 because this represents the calorie contribution of 130 g of carbohydrate per day in a 2000‐kcal diet. 130 g is the minimum intake of carbohydrate recommended by the American Diabetes Association 14 and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 15.

Median daily consumption of fruit juices and sugar‐sweetened beverages was also significantly higher in the NCHO groups (P < 0.0001) (Table 2). People in the LCHO group (defined as CHO <26% kcal) reported an intake of red meat twice that of the NCHO group (≥45% kcal; red meat: 2.0 servings day–1, IQR = 0.5–3.33 versus 0.9 servings day–1, IQR = 0–1.5; P < 0.0001) (Table 2), although these differences were attenuated when LCHO was defined as <130 g day–1. There were also differences in the frequency of red meats (beef, lamb and pork) consumed, with a greater percentage of the <26% kcal group consuming these foods two or more times week compared to the ≥45% kcal group (see Supporting information, Table S1) and a greater percentage of the ≥45% reporting never consuming these foods compared to the <26% kcal group. However, once vegans and vegetarians were accounted for, there was no difference in the never‐consumers. Reported differences in frequency of intake of these food groups were minimised when LCHO was defined as <130 g day–1 from CHO (see Supporting information, Table S1). Processed meats were consumed with greater frequency in the NCHO group compared to the LCHO groups when defined by grammes (see Supporting information, Table S1). Median daily intake of nuts, seeds and oily fish was significantly higher in the LCHO groups (Table 2), although the intake of these items was relatively low, with only 20% of the whole cohort consuming the recommended amount of oily fish twice a week (see Supporting information, Table S1). Similarly, the NCHO groups consumed significantly more pulses than the LCHO groups, although the overall consumption of these items was low (Table 2).  More than half of both LCHO groups consumed butter as their spread of choice compared to one‐third of the NCHO groups (Table 3). People consuming a NCHO diet also reported a significantly greater amount and variety of fruits and vegetables consumed (Table 3). Of note, most people on both LCHO diets reported having consumed zero types of fruits across the 24‐h dietary recalls, with a further quarter having only one portion (Table 2). Similarly, a greater proportion of people on a LCHO diet reported consuming zero types of vegetables across the 24‐h dietary recalls, although there were no differences between the groups with respect to the percentage of people consuming more than four servings across the dietary recalls.  Intake of macro‐ and micronutrients The reported intakes of macronutrients, total sugar and fibre were all significantly different regardless of whether LCHO was calculated by kcal or the absolute number of grammes (Table 4). All groups exceeded the recommendations for saturated fat. Both LCHO groups reported a fibre intake of ≤11 g per day but, across all groups, fibre intake fell short of the current recommendations of the American Association of Analytical Chemists of 30 g day–1 (approximately 24 g fibre day–1 as calculated via the Englyst method used in UK Biobank).

",NA,No others,Yes,"""In this cross‐sectional study, the reported intakes of key foods and food groups differed between the LCHO and NCHO groups, although both groups included foods that were both beneficial and potentially deleterious to long‐term health.  Individuals in the NCHO groups reported consuming substantially more foods such as doughnuts, pastries, biscuits and chocolate compared to the LCHO groups. A potential advantage of LCHO diets includes the observation that, by reducing dietary CHO, such diets will inevitably reduce added sugars 13. Furthermore, because much of the added sugar in the UK diet comes from foods that are also high in fat, LCHO diets lead to a reduction in these energy‐dense, highly palatable items, which are over‐consumed across the UK population 28. The present analysis suggests this may be the case and the findings are supported by a cross‐sectional study in a US population reporting that added sugars provided 4% kcal in the LCHO group (<30% kcal from CHO) versus 21% in the high CHO group (>55% kcal from CHO) 29. Reverse causality cannot be ruled out, although a previous study also found that the reduction in CHO was associated with a selective reduction in added sugars 13. The UK Biobank dataset provides total sugars from all sources (all mono‐ and disaccharides, including those from milk and present in the structure of foods, such as fruit and vegetables) and so it is not possible to determine the association between the CHO restriction and added sugar restriction in the present study. In any case, to determine whether a LCHO diet leads to a specific reduction in added sugars, a prospective study in people intentionally following a LCHO diet would be required.  Similar to a previous analysis 13, the present study finds that individuals in the LCHO group consume higher quantities of meat, poultry and fish compared to people on a NCHO diet. In general, these differences were small and the statistical significance is a consequence of the large sample size in the study. Poultry appeared to be the most frequently consumed source of animal protein across the whole cohort and close to half of individuals reported consuming beef, lamb and pork less than once per week. This likely reflects the fact that the BIOBANK and similar volunteer cohorts tend to engage in healthier behaviours than the wider population 30. However, only 20% of people in the LCHO group and 15% in the NCHO groups met the current recommendations for oily fish consumption. The consumption of vegetable‐sources of protein was higher in the NCHO groups but, in general, they were consumed in small amounts across the cohort. Nuts, seeds and pulses are also high in micronutrients, fibre and other non‐nutritive components likely beneficial for health 31-33. Therefore, most individuals in the UK BIOBANK cohort would benefit from increasing their consumption of oily fish, nuts, seeds and pulses, irrespective of whether they are consuming a NCHO or LCHO diet.  Fruit and vegetable intake were calculated by summing each different fruit and vegetable that was consumed over each of the 24‐h dietary recalls and thus appeared high compared to typically reported intakes 13. Fruit was consumed much less frequently and in much less variety in the LCHO compared to the NCHO group, which might be a result of individuals on a LCHO diet attempting to avoid excessive ‘sugar’. Mono‐ and di‐saccharides are often referred to under the umbrella of ‘sugar’ in the lay press, despite lactose, glucose and fructose having substantially different glycaemic indices 34 and distinct metabolic effects. For example, fructose consumed in excess, and in particular in liquid form, is causally related to hepatic triglyceride deposition 35, whereas fruit consumed in typical quantities lowers post‐prandial glucose compared to starch and other sugars, without deleterious effects on metabolic function 36. If individuals are concerned about the glycaemic effect of whole fruits, advice could be offered on low‐glycaemic varieties.  The LCHO groups had a higher percentage of people consuming zero servings of vegetables over the five dietary recalls compared to the NCHO groups. Two previous studies have indicated that people consuming a LCHO eating pattern eat more vegetables, which may be due to their largely negligible available CHO content 13, 37. The difference in the present study may be that the LCHO group in the UK BIOBANK had higher material deprivation. Vegetables, when eaten in variety, can provide a substantial amount of fibres, micronutrients and non‐nutritive compounds 38. Fibre is particularly important when individuals are consuming fewer high‐fibre foods such as cereals, wholegrain breads and fruits. Notwithstanding the limitation of the LCHO data originating primarily from one 24‐dietary recall, it is of some concern that a large proportion of people report having zero vegetables. Individuals who aim to follow a LCHO diet should be counselled to consume sufficient vegetables, with an emphasis on the benefits for general and gastrointestinal health.  An oft‐cited concern regarding LCHO diets is that they may be deficient in key nutrients 2. In the present study, only potassium and magnesium were lower than the recommended intakes for the LCHO diets. Caution must be applied to these results because 24‐h dietary recalls can be unreliable for micronutrients 39. Nevertheless, potassium and magnesium are under‐consumed across the population, with lower intakes in reduced‐carbohydrate diets being reported previously 13, and potassium intake from 24‐h dietary recalls may be comparable to dietary records 39. Increasing the consumption of fruits (low‐glycaemic if necessary) and vegetables alongside, nuts, dairy products and oily fish would be a sensible, whole‐diet centred recommendation for people consuming both LCHO and NCHO diets.  To our knowledge, the calorie contribution of alcohol in LCHO diets has not been discussed at length previously. Alcohol consumption in this study is significantly higher in both LCHO groups than in the NCHO groups, even when the proportion of CHO is calculated from non‐alcohol kcal. If we calculate a LCHO diet from total energy intake (data not shown), alcohol contributes up to 16% of the calories consumed in the LCHO group. We note this because alcohol calories are not mentioned in documents suggesting cut‐offs for LCHO diets 9 and, accordingly, future analyses in this area should take this into account. Furthermore, alcohol intake should be considered within the context of CHO restriction and practitioners should work with patients to ensure that alcohol is not replacing CHO.""",Yes,see 18,Partially,"see 18. Does so for differences in group size but no other discussed sources of bias e.g. under/over reporting ""Therefore, the dietary intake of the LCHO reported in the present study has a greater margin of error compared to the NCHO diet. It is also important to recognise that there was a greater proportion of people in the LCHO groups whose data originate from only one dietary recall. """,Yes,"We offer some recommendations for further research in this area: given the very small number of people following a LCHO diet in a dataset with more than 200 000 dietary recalls available, future research may require a specific survey of people deliberately consuming a LCHO diet. This would also address the limitation of the present study in that we cannot be sure these individuals were intentionally following a LCHO diet. It would also be useful to determine the reason why people choose to follow the diet to observe whether this influences dietary choices such as the consumption of fruits.  In conclusion, the present study finds that self‐reported dietary intake in LCHO dietary patterns has both favourable and potentially adverse characteristics compared to a NCHO diet. The LCHO groups consumed fewer high‐sugar, high‐fat snack items, as well as fewer fruit and vegetables and more alcohol. In general, both LCHO and NCHO groups would benefit from increasing oily fish, pulses, and nuts and seeds.",Yes,"""Finally, the BIOBANK cohort is healthier than the general population 30, being predominantly Caucasian, and the LCHO groups are predominantly female.

Many studies have reported that a range of different blood-based inflammatory biomarkers are associated with an increased risk of incident CVD events.3–7 This initially led to an interest in reducing the risk of CVD by targeting patients with evidence of inflammation as illustrated by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.8 More recently, with genetic evidence supporting interleukin-6 pathway as causal in the development of CVD,9 interest has emerged in directly inhibiting specific parts of the inflammatory pathway to prevent CVD.10,11  One of the simplest, and most commonly measured markers of the immune response and inflammation, is the total white blood cell (WBC) count. Many studies have reported that an elevated WBC is associated with higher rates of incident CVD12–15 and non-CVD mortality.13,16 The association between elevated WBC and elevated CVD risk may indicate that infection and inflammation are part of the pathway leading to the development of CVD. However, WBC may also reflect poor health and risk of death from any cause and therefore be a nonspecific association.  Different subpopulations of WBC (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils) may also be associated with CVD and non-CVD mortality.14,17,18 In particular, elevated neutrophil counts may be associated with a higher risk of CVD in routine population data sets,18 although the influence of clinical susceptibility bias is difficult to account for in such databases, and the influence of reverse causality requires consideration.19 An additional consideration is that different associations in specific cell types may be suggestive of distinct pathways that lead to CVD. Although neutrophils (granulocytes that comprise the majority of circulating WBCs) can cause tissue damage, including in the walls of blood vessels via the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps,20 which in turn lead to macrophage-produced interleukin precursors,21 other white cell types such as monocytes (precursors of tissue macrophages) may also be important.22""",Yes,"""To explore these associations further, we examined the association between WBC and the differential leukocyte counts with all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, and non-CVD mortality in the UK Biobank population.""",Yes,"""To explore these associations further, we examined the association between WBC and the differential leukocyte counts with all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, and non-CVD mortality in the UK Biobank population.

Recent data from a large cohort study has shown that WBC was associated with coronary heart disease and cancer mortality among healthy women, even after excluding those with comorbidities (CVDs, connective tissue disease, ulcerative colitis, liver disease, diabetes mellitus, or cancers) and early deaths during follow-up.13 The association of WBC with CVD mortality among women in UK Biobank was fairly weak, but the association of neutrophils with CVD we report was strong in both sexes and is also similar to a recent large cohort study.18 Our sensitivity analysis attenuated associations of circulating leukocyte counts with mortality outcomes. This suggests an element of reverse causality.19 Mechanisms that explain this observation likely include the association between neutrophilia and trauma, stress, bacterial infection, smoking, and indolent cancer,29 any of which ultimately might increase the risk of death from any cause. Likewise, lymphopenia is likely to be caused by old age, viral infection, autoimmune disease, renal failure, and immunosuppressive drugs.30 By excluding those with a range of baseline diseases, and those who develop disease within 2 years of baseline, the present results provide models that limit the effect of baseline disease on counts themselves.  What mechanisms might explain the association of leukocytes with CVD mortality? The inflammatory hypothesis of CVD is well established.31 Underpinning this, cellular atherosclerotic plaques appear more prone to rupture.32 It is hypothesized that leukocytes may play a direct role in destabilizing the plaque itself33,34 through fibrous cap thinning, although it may be that circulating levels of leukocytes do not necessarily reflect resident cells within atherosclerotic plaques. Investigating specific differential counts, our data suggest that high circulating neutrophil levels are linearly associated with CVD mortality that occurs beyond a 2-year time horizon in ostensibly healthy people. The same does not seem to be true of other leukocytes. It is interesting that, until recently, neutrophils were a neglected leukocyte in atherosclerosis research. There are clear mechanisms that might explain why neutrophils might play an important role in causing CVD death.35 Neutrophils interact with cholesterol crystals to produce pro-IL-1β.20 They can form structures that bind bacteria and platelets, the end result of which is that neutrophils release nuclear material leading to cell death and thrombosis.36 Neutrophils are, therefore, intimately linked to the inflammatory cascade, which can be promoted through a proatherogenic environment. Other environmental factors, such as smoking,37 might also promote neutrophilia and CVD death, resulting in confounding. However, our sensitivity analysis suggests that there may be an independent association too. Inhibiting IL-1β in patients with established CVD reduces cardiovascular events10,25 and strongly reduces circulating neutrophil counts.26,27 Our findings suggest that further work should be done in patients without preexisting CVD to determine whether IL-1β blockers, or other modulators of the immune response to inflammation, may have a role to play in the prevention of CVD and the role of neutrophils in this context.  Higher neutrophil counts were also associated with a higher risk of non-CVD death. Here, the association may be even more complex. Specific non-CVD conditions may be linked to higher neutrophil counts through different pathways. For instance, there is evidence that people with chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis have increased risk of death beyond that caused by CVD (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.22752/abstract). There has also been speculation that tumor-infiltrating neutrophils may be important in the prognosis of several types of cancer (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044579X13000138). As noted above, mechanisms that may underlie the associations we observe include the influence of indolent malignancy (both solid organ and hematological) and other confounders such as inflammatory diseases and smoking. Although we corrected for as many of these as possible through multivariable analysis and sensitivity analysis, there remains a significant element of confounding and reverse causality. More work is required to examine the association between neutrophils and specific non-CVD causes of death to determine potential mechanisms underlying our findings.  Our study has many strengths. The UK Biobank includes a wide sample of the UK general population in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status and as such is not derived from health records of patients with a clinical indication for leukocyte measurement, in contrast to prior work.18 Further strengths of the study include its large sample size, comprehensive phenotyping, and simultaneous consideration of differential leukocyte counts derived from a central laboratory measurement, also in contrast to prior work.18 The side-by-side comparison of CVD and non-CVD mortality gives an indication of the specificity of associations, although we did not further subdivide non-CVD morality because of lack of adjudicated outcomes. It is notable that inflammatory markers seem to have a stronger association with CVD mortality than with nonfatal events.38,39 Weaknesses include the lack of data to adjust for lipids, although the extensive adjustment model will capture much of this confounding by proxy. Lack of adjustment for medication is a further limitation, although again adjustment for comorbidity accounts for much of the association. Reverse causality is possible in any observational study, and although our results include a sensitivity analysis and an analysis excluding those with diagnosed comorbidities, we cannot exclude the potential of further reverse causality explaining some of the associations that we report.

INTRODUCTION Ménière’s disease, a disorder of the inner ear, defined by episodes of vertigo, aural fullness, tinnitus, and sensorineural hearing loss, afflicts hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide (Sajjadi & Paparella 2008). Currently, our understanding of the disease etiology remains obscure. It is a complex multifactorial disease with a range of risk factors implicated including family history (genetic and/or childhood environment) (Gazquez & Lopez-Escamez 2011), viral infection (Williams et al. 1987), allergy (Derebery & Berliner 2010), autoimmunity (Gazquez et al. 2011), and nervous system dysfunction (e.g., migraine; Peroutka 2004) all identified as potential contributory factors (Tyrrell et al. 2014a).  Concomitant diseases and other risk factors such as family history, viral infection, and allergy suggest that early-life exposures may contribute to an individual’s risk of developing Ménière’s. However, to date, very limited information is available on the role of early-life exposure in developing Ménière’s. Furthermore, the Barker Hypothesis may also play a role in disease etiology (Hales et al. 1991). A key proxy for differing exposures in intrauterine, perinatal, and early childhood is adult anthropometric measures, especially leg length. Poor maternal and childhood health, insufficient diet (energy intake was positively associated with leg length; beta 0.0027 [0.0013–0.0041]) (Wadsworth et al. 2002), adverse family circumstances (e.g., socioeconomic status [SES] and overcrowding in early childhood both reduce adult leg length by approximately 10–15 cm; Li et al. 2007), and maternal smoking during pregnancy are each known to reduce leg length, independent of birth weight (Gunnell et al. 1998; Wadsworth et al. 2002; Gunnell et al. 2003; Li et al. 2007).  Numerous studies have demonstrated that taller adults have lower risks of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity (Whitley et al. 2012). Furthermore, studies have indicated that leg length is the main contributor to this association (Gunnell et al. 2003), with trunk length associations, weaker or absent. The mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. The prepubertal linear growth occurs more in the leg than in the trunk (Whitley et al. 2012), and leg length may be a particularly sensitive marker of adverse prepubertal environmental factors that affect growth. Studies have also demonstrated that leg length was sensitive to infant (younger than 5 years) socioeconomic circumstance and diet (Wadsworth et al. 2002). Leg length in childhood is robustly correlated with leg length in adulthood. Shorter leg length has been associated with a number of adulthood diseases including coronary heart disease (CHD) (Lawlor et al. 2004) and type 2 diabetes (Lawlor et al. 2002).  The role of early-life exposures in the subsequent development of Ménière’s has not been investigated to date, and this may be due to the lack of large cohorts with available data on both Ménière’s and anthropometric measures.""",Yes,"""The role of early-life exposures in the subsequent development of Ménière’s has not been investigated to date, and this may be due to the lack of large cohorts with available data on both Ménière’s and anthropometric measures.

For the first time, we demonstrated inverse associations existed between Ménière’s and the components of adult height. We also observed that higher IMD scores (representing greater deprivation) for place of birth was associated with increased odds of Ménière’s.  The crude results show a similar level of association between the diagnosis of Ménière’s disease and any of the individual components of adult height, that is, total height, leg length, and trunk length. This observation is in accordance with previous research showing that total adult height is associated with lower rates of a number of chronic diseases (Davey Smith et al. 2000) although the physiological mechanisms behind this are not always clear (Bray et al. 2006).  After adjusting for potential confounders in the form of age, BMI, CHD, diabetes, ethnicity, sex, smoking, and social class as defined by education, trunk length ceases to be a significant predictor of the diagnosis of Ménière’s disease, and it appears that overall height and leg length are the components of adult height most strongly associated with the disease. This finding is consistent, when tested in all cases and controls, in cases versus age- and sex-matched controls and in a subgroup analysis of women only. In a subgroup analysis of men only, no component of height was found to be a significant predictor of Ménière’s disease after adjustment for confounders.""",Yes,"""We acknowledge some limitations with our data. The disease diagnosis was self-reported; however, people were also able to select vestibular disorder, tinnitus, vertigo, and labyrinthitis which, along with the presence and advice of a trained nurse, should have reduced the number of people incorrectly reporting Ménière’s. Furthermore, the self-reported Ménière’s sufferers had increased odds of Ménière’s-type symptoms and reporting the use of Ménière’s medication and commonly used dietary self-management. It is possible that the people reporting Ménière’s in the UK Biobank are incorrectly diagnosed. Ménière’s is particularly difficult to diagnose in the early stages of the disease. We performed a sensitivity analysis where we excluded individuals diagnosed in the 5 years before recruitment to the UK Biobank, as it is anticipated that in this time frame, newly diagnosed individuals will undergo a range of tests that might suggest misdiagnosis (Sajjadi & Paparella 2008).  There may be participants in the UK Biobank who have Meniere’s disease but are not yet diagnosed, but as the prevalence was 0.27% which is similar to prior studies, we believe this number to be small. The recruitment strategy of the UK Biobank meant that it is not a representative sample of the British population (borne out by the under-representation of ethnic minorities), and selection criteria also limit it to the 40- to 70-year-old age range. Volunteer bias may have occurred, with more people with health conditions volunteering than healthy individuals. Healthy participant bias may also operate in the opposing direction with relatively fit people participating, as some travel to recruitment centers were involved (with a large proportion of participants past the retirement age participating). Finally, we used the cross-sectional baseline data of the UK Biobank; however, as we are investigating associations between Ménière’s and height, we can assume that factors contributing to height occurred before the diagnosis of Ménière’s in most individuals.  Other unmeasured factors not considered in the analyses may underlie the associations; for example, growth-regulating genes may be independently associated with Ménière’s. Genetics currently explain approximately 12% of the variation in adult height although it is anticipated that more variants will be identified in the future. We were unable to investigate the role of genetics within this study; future work should consider the associations while accounting for known height variants. Alternatively, taller individuals are considered to be more successful in later life (Case & Paxson 2006), and this may protect against Ménière’s rather than some growth-influencing exposure. Our previous work suggested an inverse association between educational attainment and Ménière’s (Tyrrell et al. 2014a).  We were also unable to account for changes in height due to aging. However, age-related changes in height are predominantly attributed to shrinkage of the trunk, and therefore, our findings for leg length, the well-defined marker of an adverse childhood environment, will not be altered (Fernihough & McGovern 2014), suggesting that our findings are accurate.""",Yes,se 19_i,Yes,"""This study provides evidence of an inverse association between Ménière’s disease and stature. Our results are consistent with previous studies investigating a range of diseases including cardiovascular disease, heart disease, and diabetes (Gunnell et al. 1998; Lawlor et al. 2002; Gunnell et al. 2003; Lawlor et al. 2004). These studies demonstrated that adult height and particularly leg length were inversely associated with disease prevalence in adulthood. A recent study demonstrated an association between leg length and metabolic disorders underlying type 2 diabetes, including lower insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function (Johnston et al. 2013). Previous studies into Ménière’s have suggested an association between the disease and insulin resistance (Lavinsky et al. 2013)...This study demonstrated robust associations between Ménière’s and the components of adult height, with consistent associations with leg length after adjusting for various confounders. The specific association between leg length and Ménière’s may suggest that early-life environmental exposures that influence skeletal growth also influence Ménière’s risk in later life. This is feasible as factors that influence skeletal growth are likely to impact on the development of the nervous and immune systems, both of which are implicated in Ménière’s etiology (Tyrrell et al. 2014a).

We analysed cross-sectional associations between dietary magnesium and skeletal muscle mass (as fat free mass—FFM), grip strength, and bone density (BMD) in 156,575 men and women aged 39–72 years from the UK Biobank cohort. FFM was measured with bioelectrical impedance and was expressed as the percentage of body weight (FFM%) or as divided by body mass index (FFMBMI). Adjusted mean grip strength, FFM%, FFMBMI, and BMD were calculated according to quintiles of dietary magnesium, while correcting for covariates. Significant inter-quintile differences across intakes of magnesium existed in men and women, respectively, of 1.1% and 2.4% for grip strength, 3.0% and 3.6% for FFM%, 5.1% and 5.5% for FFMBMI, and 2.9% and 0.9% for BMD. These associations are as great or greater than annual measured losses of these musculoskeletal outcomes, indicating potential clinical significance. Our study suggests that dietary magnesium may play a role in musculoskeletal health and has relevance for population prevention strategies for sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and fractures.

Introduction Fragility fractures, sarcopenia (the presence of low skeletal muscle mass and function), and frailty are becoming more prevalent in our aging society with their attendant disabilities and costs for health and social care. Moreover, maintaining mobility and wellbeing in our aging society is important. The costs of falls and fractures are £2.3 billion per year in the UK ($17 billion in the US), with one in two women and one in five men experiencing a fracture over the age of 50 years [1,2]. Estimates of the costs of sarcopenia are $US18.5B, and they are set to rise [3]. Osteoporosis (the presence of low bone density, BMD) is a well-recognised risk factor for fragility fractures [4,5,6,7], but more recently the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass, function and sarcopenia, as well as frailty, have also been recognised as risk factors for osteoporosis, falls, and fractures [6,7,8]. Skeletal muscle provides protection through hormonal or endocrine interactions between muscle and bone, muscle force generated mechanical signals, and maintenance of postural balance. So, conserving skeletal muscle mass and function is important for prevention of fractures [9,10,11]. Both osteoporosis and sarcopenia are highly prevalent. Estimates for the prevalence of osteoporosis in the community are 22.1% and 5.5% in European women and men, aged 50 years and over [1]. In the USA 77.1% of women and 10.0% of men, over the age of 65 years have either osteoporosis or low bone density [12]. Sarcopenia has been identified in between 1% and 29% in community dwelling people over the age of 60 years, with estimates for those living in long term care of between 14% and 33% [13,14]. Recent predictions for Europe estimate that the prevalence of sarcopenia will almost double overall in the elderly population to 22.3% by 2045 [13,14]. The prevalence of frailty is 25% in those over the age in 80 [12]. It is clear that the prevalence of all these conditions (osteoporosis, sarcopenia and frailty, and number of fractures) will rise in line with the increasing age of populations in the UK and USA, as will the costs of health and social care for their treatment [3,13,15,16]. Prior to a diagnosis of these conditions, gradual losses in bone density and skeletal muscle mass and strength (sarcopenic risk factors) occur in a continuum starting from the age 30 years, with increasing rates of loss in those over the age of 60 years [17,18]. Importantly, these conditions, once present, are difficult to reverse and current treatment strategies are limited. Therefore, maintaining skeletal muscle and bone health during aging is important in our populations, and new preventative strategies in middle and younger older ages (middle age 40–60 years, younger older age 60 to 70 years) are needed. Dietary composition can impact on the mechanisms leading to age-related loss of bone density, skeletal muscle mass or function. Calcium is well established as essential for bone health, as is protein for skeletal muscle, but other nutrients that are integral to bone and muscle physiology, such as magnesium (Mg), have not been investigated extensively and concurrently in relation to both skeletal muscle and bone health in both men and women of middle and younger older age [19,20,21,22,23]. The mechanism by which Mg may protect against osteoporosis and sarcopenic risk factors may be through the protection from cytokine induced stimulation of osteoclast activity or the protection of loss of skeletal muscle mass or strength. For osteoporosis, Mg can influence osteoblast activity as well as hydroxyapatite crystal formation, and regulation of calcium homeostasis through interactions between parathyroid hormone and vitamin D [24,25]. For skeletal muscle, Mg has direct physiological and metabolic roles, including maintenance of protein synthesis and turnover. Mg may also affect muscle performance though energy metabolism (production of ATP), transmembrane transport, and muscle contraction and relaxation [26,27]. Moreover, skeletal muscle and bone contain the majority of Mg in the body with 60% found in bone and 27% in muscle, indicating the importance of Mg to the musculoskeletal system [28]. Understanding the gender specific differences in associations between diet and skeletal muscle and bone health is important, as men attain a higher proportion of skeletal muscle mass, grip strength, and BMD at younger ages than women. Also, the effects of aging differ, with men losing a higher percentage of muscle mass and a lower percentage of BMD than women as they age. Few studies have investigated the sarcopenic risk factors with dietary magnesium in middle and older aged populations and even fewer investigated these associations according to gender. Grip strength has only been investigated in five previous studies with dietary or supplemental Mg intake or blood concentrations, and only one of these was in men [20,21,27,29,30]. Even fewer studies have investigated the associations between Mg and skeletal muscle mass, with none investigating associations in men only [20,21,29,30]. Of the greater number of studies investigating dietary magnesium and bone density, most were in older women (34), with only five investigating associations independently in men [25,31,32,33,34].""",Yes,"""To our knowledge, no studies have previously investigated dietary Mg and measures of both bone and skeletal muscle health concurrently in the same cohort, independently in men and women.

Statistical Analysis We examined the association between dietary Mg, skeletal muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density using multivariable regression techniques. First, for men and women separately, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of each outcome variable for each sex-specific quintile of dietary Mg (model 1). Then, we fitted Mg quintiles as the predictor in an adjusted model, again for men and women separately, with the covariates included. For this adjusted model, we calculated adjusted means with standard errors of each outcome for each sex-specific quintile of dietary Mg (model 2). For both models, we tested for a trend (p value given as p trend in the tables) in these unadjusted (model 1) and adjusted (model 2) values by fitting the median value of the outcome variable within each quintile as a continuous variable. Model 2 was also adjusted for sex-specific quintile of percentage energy from protein, smoking status, age group, physical activity levels, dietary energy intake, the ratio of EI:EER, the number of food questionnaires completed, whether the participant took Mg supplements, and, for women, whether the participant took HRT and whether she had experienced menopause. For the measures of skeletal muscle mass and strength, we also adjusted for whether the participant had taken cholesterol-lowering drugs. For BMD, we also adjusted for BMI, dietary calcium, dietary vitamin D, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. For grip strength, we additionally adjusted for height. To determine whether there might be a different relationship between Mg and the outcomes of interest by age, we repeated the analyses stratified by age (<60 years and ≥60 years).

For both models, we tested for a trend (p value given as p trend in the tables) in these unadjusted (model 1) and adjusted (model 2) values by fitting the median value of the outcome variable within each quintile as a continuous variable. Model 2 was also adjusted for sex-specific quintile of percentage energy from protein, smoking status, age group, physical activity levels, dietary energy intake, the ratio of EI:EER, the number of food questionnaires completed, whether the participant took Mg supplements, and, for women, whether the participant took HRT and whether she had experienced menopause. For the measures of skeletal muscle mass and strength, we also adjusted for whether the participant had taken cholesterol-lowering drugs. For BMD, we also adjusted for BMI, dietary calcium, dietary vitamin D, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. For grip strength, we additionally adjusted for height. To determine whether there might be a different relationship between Mg and the outcomes of interest by age, we repeated the analyses stratified by age (<60 years and ≥60 years). Loss of skeletal muscle can occur during the loss of body weight and also in certain conditions of chronic disease e.g., respiratory disease, diabetes, and chronic renal failure [46,47,48]. To test whether our analyses were affected by the loss of body weight that was linked to the presence of chronic illness, we performed a sensitivity analysis by dropping individuals from the study if they answered yes to both of two questions: (1) whether individuals had seen a weight change compared to a year ago and (2) whether they had a long-standing illness, disability or infirmity n = 7730. We then repeated the analyses on this smaller dataset (n = 148,845). To understand the association between total fat free mass and total appendicular lean mass, the correlation was calculated in men and women. In order to compare the relative scale of the associations between Mg intake and the different indices of skeletal muscle and bone, the differences in the values for these outcomes, between the top and bottom quintiles of Mg intake, were calculated as a percentage as follows; the difference between quintile 5 and quintile 1 of the values for the outcome indices were calculated and the percentage difference calculated as a percentage of the value of quintile 1.

This is important as these factors are associated with an increased risk of falls, frailty, sarcopenia, and fractures. Higher intakes of dietary Mg were positively associated with a greater grip strength, indices of skeletal muscle mass, and BMD in both men and women aged 39–72 years continuously across the distribution of intakes. The inter-quintile differences associated with dietary Mg ranged from 1.1% and 2.4% for grip strength to 5.1% and 5.5% for FFMBMI, in men and women, respectively, but were smaller for BMD being 2.9% and 0.9%. When comparing these differences with previously measured longitudinal annual losses of skeletal muscle mass, grip strength and bone density, the associations found across the distribution of Mg intake ranged from one quarter in men to three quarters in women, for grip strength, and from 3 times in men to 5.1 times in women for FFM%. For BMD, these comparisons were 1.9 times in women and 9.7 times in men. Moreover, the associations were in the main of a similar scale in younger, as well as older, men and women, indicating that dietary Mg has relevance for protection for skeletal muscle and bone outcomes both in middle and younger older age groups. In men over the age of 60 years, the interquintile differences found in grip strength were around twice that of younger men. Whilst these findings are cross-sectional, they indicate that it is likely to be important for older men to consume sufficient dietary magnesium. Our findings were also significant after statistical adjustment for the important factors that contribute to skeletal muscle and bone loss: Age, smoking, and physical activity, and in women, HRT medication. For skeletal muscle our results remained significant after adjustment for dietary protein, which has been traditionally regarded as the most important nutrient for skeletal muscle health. For bone density, we also accounted for dietary and supplemental intakes of calcium. Thus, our results are independent of protein for muscle and of calcium for bone which have well established structural and physiological roles for musculoskeletal health. Mg also has important metabolic, physiological, and structural roles in the musculoskeletal system""",Yes,"""One of limitations of this study is that it is a cross-sectional design and so we cannot infer causation. Also, since we excluded individuals of non-Caucasian background, our findings may not apply to those of different ethnic origin. Body composition was measured with BIA, which is considered as less precise than measurements made with DXA, although BIA is regarded as accurate in healthy individuals [56,60]. However, the method used for this study is single frequency BIA and so may underestimate the loss of skeletal muscle mass as compared with measurements made with multi-frequency BIA [61]. Heel BMD was measured by ultrasound attenuation rather than DXA, but previous studies have found that ultrasound methods are associated with osteoporotic risk factors and predict the incidence of fractures [62,63].

Former heavy (>20/day) smokers were also more likely to report short (<6 h) sleep duration (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.25–1.60; P < 0.001), long-sleep duration (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.47–2.71; P < 0.001) and sleeplessness (OR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.38–1.57; P < 0.001) than never smokers.

Conclusions Active and passive exposure to high levels of tobacco smoke are associated with sleep disturbance.

Economic implications of sleep disturbance cannot be overlooked and include increased absenteeism and lost productivity,13 more accidents14 and increased healthcare utilisation and costs.13 In the USA, the annual economic burden of sleep disturbance has been estimated at $100 billion,13 and the National Health Service (NHS) in England spends around £50 million on sleep medication each year.15  It is evident that nicotine can stimulate the release of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine16 which, in turn, may inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and sleep-promoting neurons located in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), causing excessive arousal of the body.17 Electroencephalography (EEG) reports have also revealed marked differences in sleep waves between smokers and non-smokers, with smokers having frequent arousals.18 There is strong evidence that smoking cessation is associated with poor sleep;19 however, previous studies on active smoking and sleep characteristics have produced conflicting results. For instance, while some studies have reported positive associations between active smoking and sleep disturbance,20–25 others have reported no association26–32 or even negative associations.33–35 Furthermore, research is lacking into whether exposure to passive smoking is associated with sleep disturbance.

Those who had previously smoked were grouped as ‘former smokers’, and those who were neither current smokers nor had previously smoked were grouped as ‘never smokers.’ In addition, data on daily number of cigarettes consumed by current and former smokers, and whether never smokers lived with one or more current smoker were obtained from the participants.37  Sleep duration was defined as the total number of hours a respondent reported to be sleeping in a day. The participants were asked: ‘About how many hours of sleep do you get in every 24 h?’ We categorised the numerical responses into short-sleep duration (<6 h per day), normal (6–9 h per day) and long-sleep duration (>9 h per day) using the National Sleep Foundation definition of short-, long- and normal-sleep duration.38 The questions: ‘Do you have trouble falling asleep at night or do you wake up in the middle of the night?’ and ‘How likely are you to doze off or fall asleep during the daytime when you don’t mean to?’ were used to evaluate sleeplessness and DD, respectively.37  The participants’ health state was evaluated with a question that asked the participants to rate their health on a scale of 1–4: ‘1’ equated to ‘excellent health’ and ‘4’ equated to ‘poor health.’ They were also asked whether they felt ‘stressed’ or ‘depressed’ and their responses were used to ascertain stress and depression separately.37 Shift work was evaluated with a question that asked the participants to describe their current shift pattern, whether it involved a shift schedule. The responses were: ‘Not’, ‘Sometimes’, ‘Usually’ and ‘Always’ in shift work.

However, participants are not necessarily representative in terms of lifestyle. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to generalise summary statistics, such as prevalence, to the general population. However, estimates of the magnitude of associations, such as between tobacco and sleep, should be generalisable. In common with most epidemiological studies of sleep, sleep characteristics were self-reported; objective measurement of parameters such as sleep duration would, however, not be feasible within such a large study. It is also important to mention that the questions used to evaluate sleep disturbance were not from a validated scale such as the General Sleep Disturbance Scale. Smoking characteristics were also self-reported; reports of smoking status and level of exposure could not be corroborated by objective measures such as cotinine assay. Whilst we adjusted for a wide range of potential confounders, residual confounding is always possible within any observational study. For instance, we used self-reported depression and stress as a proxy for mental health and it is possible that these do not completely measure overall mental health. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders and are also associated with sleep disturbance and probably initiation of cigarette smoking, but we could not adjust for anxiety in our analysis. Additionally, since this was a cross-sectional study, it was not possible to determine the temporal relationship between smoking and sleep; therefore, reverse causation cannot be excluded. For example, sleep disturbance might lead to mental disorders such as anxiety and depression.51 There is some evidence to suggest that poor stress control and anxiety disorders are among the factors that predict initiation of cigarette smoking.52,5""",No,,Partially,"Makes a policy suggestion despite limitations ""Tobacco exposure is known to directly increase the risk of many diseases including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and many cancers.54 Our study suggests that there is also an association between tobacco exposure and a number of sleep characteristics. If this association is causal, tobacco exposure may also be impacting on health partly via an effect on sleep. Smoking prevalence and exposure to passive smoking are declining in many developed countries. However, these improvements are more than offset by increases in highly populated, developing, and newly industrialised countries such as China. As a result, the global prevalence of active smoking and passive exposure to tobacco is expected to continue increasing over the next few decades.55 Currently, ~6 million deaths are attributed to smoking every year, of which 0.6 million are associated with passive smoke exposure.56 It may be beneficial to enforce the existing global tobacco control interventions to reduce the impact on a wide range of health parameters, including sleep disturbance""",Yes,"""The UK Biobank is representative of the UK general population, within the age range recruited, in terms of age, sex, ethnic and socioeconomic breakdown.

We sought to verify this in lifelong non-smokers, among whom confounding by active smoking can be excluded, and investigate associations with circulatory and cancer deaths.  Methods In UK Biobank, among 149 343 white never-smokers aged 40–69 years at entry, 2401 deaths occurred over a mean of 6.5-year follow-up. In the Health Surveys for England (HSE) 1995, 1996, 2001 and Scottish Health Surveys (SHS) 1998 and 2003 combined, there were 500 deaths among 6579 white never-smokers aged 40–69 years at entry, followed for a mean of 13.9 years. SD (z) scores for forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were derived using Global Lung Initiative 2012 reference equations. These z-scores were related to deaths from all causes, circulatory disease and cancers using proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, height, socioeconomic status, region and survey.""",Yes,"""Results In the HSE–SHS data set, decreasing z-scores for FEV1 (zFEV1) and FVC (zFVC) were each associated to a similar degree with increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratios per unit decrement 1.17, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25 for zFEV1 and 1.19, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.28 for zFVC). This was replicated in Biobank (HRs 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.26 and 1.24, 1.19 to 1.29, respectively). zFEV1 and zFVC were less strongly associated with mortality from circulatory diseases in HSE–SHS (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.40 for zFVC) than in Biobank (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.60 for zFVC). For cancer mortality, HRs were more consistent between cohorts (for zFVC: HRs 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.24 in HSE–SHS and 1.10, 1.05 to 1.15 in Biobank). The strongest associations were with respiratory mortality (for zFVC: HRs 1.61, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.08 in HSE–SHS and 2.15, 1.77 to 2.61 in Biobank).

This exclusion removed 0.2% of UKB participants, 0.5% of participants in the national health surveys aged 40–69 years and 0.3% of national health survey participants aged 70 years or more.  Modelling of mortality The relationship of spirometric indices with subsequent mortality was modelled by proportional hazards (Cox) regression, which estimates the relative increase in mortality rate (HR) for a unit change in each explanatory variable. The z-scores are expressed on a SD scale, so HRs for zFEV1 and zFVC are expressed per unit decrement (ie, an increase in risk for a decrease in lung function). A typical range of z-scores among lifelong non-smokers would be 4 units. A HR of 1.2 per unit decrement corresponds approximately to a twofold difference in mortality rate across this range.  Due to the high correlation between zFEV1 and zFVC among lifelong non-smokers (0.88 in Biobank, 0.80 in national health survey participants aged 40–69 years), we modelled the association of mortality with zFEV1 both alone and jointly with zFEVFVC, and similarly for zFVC. Among never-smokers, the correlations between zFEV1 and zFEVFVC (0.35 in Biobank, 0.36 in the national surveys) and between zFVC and zFEVFVC (−0.13 in Biobank, −0.20 in the national surveys) were weak enough to avoid major collinearity in the joint models. The significance of the HR for zFEVFVC when modelled jointly with zFEV1 was used to assess whether zFVC predicted mortality independent of zFEV1, and vice versa when zFEVFVC was modelled jointly with zFEV1.  All proportional hazards models were restricted to white participants and adjusted for sex, age, standing height, socioeconomic status and region. Analyses of data from the five national health surveys were additionally adjusted for survey year as a categorical variable. Since each survey was conducted in a different year, inclusion of survey year in the model is closely equivalent to a fixed-effect meta-analysis of the results from each of the five surveys. In a more formal two-stage individual participant meta-analysis for all-cause mortality in lifelong non-smokers, there was no substantial or significant heterogeneity of HRs among the five national health surveys (I²=0.0%, p=0.775 for zFEV1; I²=10.5%, p=0.346 for zFVC). Therefore, for simplicity of presentation we report results for the five national surveys combined, but analyse UKB separately because one of our objectives is to investigate how closely these two sets of results correspond. Heterogeneity between HRs for the pooled national surveys and UKB was assessed by testing the significance of the difference between the corresponding log-HRs from these two data sets.  The assumption of proportionality of hazards was assessed by log-log plots and by fitting zFEV1 or zFVC as a time-dependent covariate in the model. No strong or statistically significant evidence of time dependence emerged for all-cause mortality among lifelong non-smokers. Nevertheless, results for all-cause mortality were partitioned at 5 years of follow-up for two reasons. First, because the minimum duration of follow-up in UKB was 4.87 years, so virtually all of that cohort had been followed for 5 years or more, allowing a more direct comparison with results from the national health surveys, all of which had been followed for more than 5 years. The second reason for partitioning at 5 years was to address the possibility of reverse causation (impaired spirometric performance due to pre-existing conditions which lead to early death). Reverse causation was also investigated by analysing mortality in subgroups with no prior history of respiratory disease, circulatory disease or cancer.""",Partially,"Not clear how age or height used ""UK Biobank This study recruited 502 682 volunteers aged 40–69 years in 22 recruitment centres throughout England, Wales and Scotland during 2006–2010, following invitations to 9 million people.15 Spirometry was performed using a handheld pneumotachograph spirometer (Pneumotrac 6800) from which volume–time arrays were stored for each blow.16  Eighty-one per cent of the cohort performed two blows with acceptable start and measures of FEV1 reproducible within 250 mL. This was considered the most inclusive sample of ‘usable spirograms’. When end-blow quality was also considered, 58% of the cohort had evidence of a good plateau and both FEV1 and FVC reproducible within 150 mL, the criteria recommended by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) Task Force on Standardisation of Spirometry.17 This subgroup of 58% was considered to be the ‘best quality’ spirograms, among which to evaluate the relative importance of FEV1 and FVC as predictors of mortality.  The present analysis is based on deaths occurring up to mid-August 2015, a mean follow-up period of 6.5 years. There were 2401 deaths among 149 343 lifelong non-smokers aged 40–69 years of white ethnicity who performed ‘usable spirograms. Deaths from respiratory disease, circulatory disease, cancer and all other causes were coded using ICD10 (chapters J, I, C and all others, respectively).  Smoking history was self reported. Socioeconomic status was measured at the level of residential area, using the Townsend Deprivation Index, grouped into quartiles for analysis. Biobank recruitment centre was used as an additional covariate to adjust for possible regional differences.  Adjustment of spirometric measures for gender, age and height The Global Lung Initiative (GLI) 2012 reference equations for white ethnic groups18 were used in both sets of data to standardise FEV1 and FVC for age, sex and height. The GLI-2012 equations generate a ‘z-score’ which represents the relative position of an individual among the distribution predicted for lifelong non-smokers with no history of lung disease of the same gender, age and height. This allows for the spread of predicted values to differ by age, height and gender, expressing the relative ranking of an individual in terms of a SD (z) score. For each individual in the analysis, there were three GLI-2012 z-scores, corresponding to their relative ranking for FEV1 (zFEV1), FVC (zFVC) and the ratio FEV1:FVC (zFEVFVC). Outlying observations were excluded by restricting all the analyses in both data sets to values of zFEV1 and zFVC within the range −5 to +5 z-score units. This exclusion removed 0.2% of UKB participants, 0.5% of participants in the national health surveys aged 40–69 years and 0.3% of national health survey participants aged 70 years or more.  Modelling of mortality The relationship of spirometric indices with subsequent mortality was modelled by proportional hazards (Cox) regression, which estimates the relative increase in mortality rate (HR) for a unit change in each explanatory variable. The z-scores are expressed on a SD scale, so HRs for zFEV1 and zFVC are expressed per unit decrement (ie, an increase in risk for a decrease in lung function). A typical range of z-scores among lifelong non-smokers would be 4 units. A HR of 1.2 per unit decrement corresponds approximately to a twofold difference in mortality rate across this range.  Due to the high correlation between zFEV1 and zFVC among lifelong non-smokers (0.88 in Biobank, 0.80 in national health survey participants aged 40–69 years), we modelled the association of mortality with zFEV1 both alone and jointly with zFEVFVC, and similarly for zFVC. Among never-smokers, the correlations between zFEV1 and zFEVFVC (0.35 in Biobank, 0.36 in the national surveys) and between zFVC and zFEVFVC (−0.13 in Biobank, −0.20 in the national surveys) were weak enough to avoid major collinearity in the joint models. The significance of the HR for zFEVFVC when modelled jointly with zFEV1 was used to assess whether zFVC predicted mortality independent of zFEV1, and vice versa when zFEVFVC was modelled jointly with zFEV1.  All proportional hazards models were restricted to white participants and adjusted for sex, age, standing height, socioeconomic status and region. Analyses of data from the five national health surveys were additionally adjusted for survey year as a categorical variable. Since each survey was conducted in a different year, inclusion of survey year in the model is closely equivalent to a fixed-effect meta-analysis of the results from each of the five surveys. In a more formal two-stage individual participant meta-analysis for all-cause mortality in lifelong non-smokers, there was no substantial or significant heterogeneity of HRs among the five national health surveys (I²=0.0%, p=0.775 for zFEV1; I²=10.5%, p=0.346 for zFVC). Therefore, for simplicity of presentation we report results for the five national surveys combined, but analyse UKB separately because one of our objectives is to investigate how closely these two sets of results correspond. Heterogeneity between HRs for the pooled national surveys and UKB was assessed by testing the significance of the difference between the corresponding log-HRs from these two data sets.  The assumption of proportionality of hazards was assessed by log-log plots and by fitting zFEV1 or zFVC as a time-dependent covariate in the model. No strong or statistically significant evidence of time dependence emerged for all-cause mortality among lifelong non-smokers.

We estimated the age-adjusted means of each characteristic in 6 diet groups (198,166 regular meat eaters, 199,784 low meat eaters, 4381 poultry eaters, 9674 fish eaters, 6366 vegetarians, and 378 vegans) in white women and men, and in 2 diet groups (3322 meat eaters and 1186 vegetarians) in British Indian women and men.""",Yes,"No test statistics ""Results In white women, after adjustment for age and compared with regular meat eaters, non–red meat eaters had lower adiposity (e.g., 4.5% lower body fat in vegan women) and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure (−4.2 and −3.3 mm Hg, respectively), and generally lower heel bone mineral density t-score (−0.26). Patterns of differences by diet group were similar in white men. In the Indian population, compared with meat eaters, vegetarian women were shorter (−1.1 cm) and had lower lean mass (−0.5 kg), and both vegetarian women and men had lower grip strength (−1.3 and −1.4 kg, respectively). No significant differences in the other characteristics were observed.  Conclusions Differences in anthropometric and physiologic characteristics were observed across diet groups in white participants, but fewer differences were observed in British Indian participants. The observed differences may be important as intermediate markers of long-term health in different diet groups. This observational study was registered at http://www.isrctn.com/ as ISRCTN10125697.""",Partially,"Very short ""INTRODUCTION Previous literature indicates that vegetarians generally have lower, and therefore more optimal, BMI, waist circumference, and blood pressure than meat eaters (1–3). However, less is known about differences between diet groups in other body-composition measures or physiologic characteristics such as bone mineral density (BMD), grip strength, or pulse rate (4–6). Overall, few large studies have comprehensively assessed anthropometric and physiologic characteristics by detailed categorization of diet groups..""",Yes,"""Because differences in anthropometric measures and other physical attributes may, in turn, influence the risk of overall mortality and the incidence of noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and fractures (7–10), an understanding of the link between diet group and these characteristics is important for establishing mechanisms that link diet to disease outcomes.

At the physical measures station, participants were asked to remove their socks and shoes. Height was measured with the use of the Seca 202 height measure (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Waist (at the natural indent) and hip (widest point) circumferences were measured over light clothes with the use of the Seca-200 tape measure (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Weight and bioimpedance were measured by using the Tanita BC418ma bioimpedance device (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan), from which percentages of body fat and lean mass were estimated. BMI was calculated as weight (kilograms)/height (meters) squared. Calcaneal bone density was taken on the left heel with the use of a Norland McCue Contact Ultrasound Bone Analyzer (Norland, Trumbull, Connecticut, USA), with participants sitting upright; and a heel BMD t-score was calculated on the basis of the measured BMD values. Hand-grip strength for each hand was taken by using the Jamar Hydraulic hand dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, Indiana, USA), and we considered both the higher grip-strength value of either hand and average grip strength of the 2 hands for our analyses. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse rate were taken with the use of the Omron HEM-7015IT digital blood pressure monitor (Omron, Kyoto, Japan) after participants have been seated for ≥5 min, and the averages of 2 measurements, taken ≥1 min apart, were used for analyses.""",Yes,"""Ethnicity classification On the touch-screen questionnaire, participants were asked to select their ethnicity from options of “White,” “Mixed,” “Asian or Asian British,” “Black or Black British,” “Chinese,” “Other ethnic group,” “Do not know,” or “Prefer not to answer.” Participants were included for analyses if they identified as “white” or as “Asian or Asian British” and subsequently as “Indian.” The white population was included because it made up the majority of the UK Biobank population (∼94%), and the British Indian population was included due to the large proportion of vegetarians in this population group (24.6% compared with 1.7% in the overall cohort)....Diet group classification For classification of diet groups, relevant dietary information from the touch-screen questionnaire was used.

Regular meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating red (beef, lamb or mutton, or pork) or processed meat >3 times/wk, whereas low meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating red or processed meat ≤3 times/wk, regardless of what else they ate. Poultry eaters were defined as participants who reported never consuming any red or processed meat but who did eat poultry. Fish eaters were participants who reported that they never consumed any red meat, processed meat, or poultry but who ate oily or nonoily fish. Vegetarians were defined as participants who reported that they never consumed any meat or fish, and vegans were participants who reported that they never consumed any meat, fish, eggs or foods containing eggs, or dairy products. A total of 2630 white participants who did not answer the relevant questions to be classified into a diet group were excluded from our analyses. For the British Indian population, 2 diet groups (meat eaters and vegetarians) were defined due to the smaller numbers in this population group. Meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating any red meat, processed meat, or poultry; and vegetarians were defined as participants who reported that they did not eat any meat or fish but did eat eggs, dairy products, or both....Statistical analyses Summary baseline characteristics of the cohort were tabulated by 6 diet groups in white women and men and by 2 diet groups in British Indian women and men. With the use of linear regression, we estimated the age-adjusted (5-y age groups from <45, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, and ≥65 y) means of the anthropometric and physiologic characteristics in each diet group. The characteristics studied were height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, body fat percentage, lean mass, heel BMD (as original values and as a t-score), grip strength (as original values and as per kilogram of lean mass), SBP, DBP, and pulse rate, all modeled continuously. Subsequently, we additionally adjusted for body weight (as 2.5-kg categories) in the analyses for heel BMD t-score; height (as 2.5-cm categories), lean mass (as 2.5-kg categories), and physical activity (as 5-unit categories in excess metabolic equivalent-hours per week) in the analyses for grip strength; and body fat percentage (as 2.5% categories) in the analyses for SBP, DBP, and pulse rate. For all covariates, missing values were coded as a missing category in the adjustment. For each baseline characteristic and each association, post hoc pairwise comparisons based on linear regression models were used to test for significant differences between the diet groups in both white and British Indian populations, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons in the white population. All statistical analyses were performed with the use of Stata release 14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA), and 2-sided P values <0.05 were considered significant.""",NA,Not used,Yes," Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 ",NA,Not used,NA,Not used,NA,Not used,Yes,"""Summary of results In this large UK cohort, differences between diet groups in anthropometric and physiologic characteristics were observed in the white population but were less apparent in the British Indian population.

Vegetarian men had lower overall grip strength but similar grip strength per kilogram of lean mass compared with meat eaters.

Models developed to identify patients at risk for EAC and increase early detection have been developed based on data from case–control studies. We analyzed data from a prospective study to identify factors available to clinicians that identify individuals with a high absolute risk of EAC.  Methods We collected data from 355,034 individuals (all older than 50 years) without a prior history of cancer enrolled in the UK Biobank prospective cohort study from 2006 through 2010; clinical data were collected through September 2014. We identified demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors, measured at baseline, that associated with development of EAC within 5 years using logistic regression analysis. We used these data to create a model to identify individuals at risk for EAC. Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity analyses.""",Yes,"""Results Within up to 5 years of follow up, 220 individuals developed EAC. Age, sex, smoking, body mass index, and history of esophageal conditions or treatments identified individuals who developed EAC (AUROC, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.77–0.82). We used these factors to develop a scoring system and identified a point cut off that 104,723 individuals (29.5%), including 170 of the 220 cases with EAC, were above. The scoring system identified individuals who developed EAC with 77.4% sensitivity and 70.5% specificity. The 5-year risk of EAC was 0.16% for individuals with scores above the threshold and 0.02% for individuals with scores below the threshold.  Conclusion We combined data on several well-established risk factors that are available to clinicians to develop a system to identify individuals with a higher absolute risk of EAC within 5 years. Studies are needed to evaluate the utility of these factors in a multi-stage, triaged, screening program.""",Yes,"""The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is increasing in Western populations,1 and prognosis is poor. Overall survival is <20%.2 Methods to improve early diagnosis are important3 because the poor survival is largely attributable to late clinical presentation with advanced disease.2  Endoscopy with biopsies for histologic confirmation is the gold standard method of detecting esophageal and gastric cancers.4, 5 However, population-wide endoscopy screening programs are unlikely to be cost-effective or feasible because of the low incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancers and the cost, invasiveness, and psychological burden of endoscopy screening.6  Clinical guidelines suggest that individuals with chronic symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) should be referred for endoscopy screening to identify Barrett’s esophagus,7 a precursor to EAC present in 1%–2% of the adult population.8 Individuals with Barrett’s esophagus are often entered into endoscopy surveillance programs.9 Use of GERD as the sole initial triage factor for endoscopy is appealing in its simplicity, but delays in obtaining endoscopy are common in part because of a lack of both specificity, because risk of EAC in individuals with GERD is low,10, 11 and sensitivity, because a large proportion of EAC cases (∼40%) never report GERD symptoms.11  Automated clinical risk prediction tools using data easily accessible to primary care physicians to flag high-risk individuals may offer a lower cost method to improve early detection and are being investigated for other conditions.12 Established risk factors including body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and GERD may be useful for risk prediction of EAC13, 14, 15 and Barrett’s esophagus.16, 17, 18 However, existing studies have relied on age and sex matched case-control data, which may be subject to recall bias and ignore age and sex in improving the risk prediction, which are strong risk factors.19 An assessment of traditional risk factors may be useful as triage directly to endoscopy, in which case risk prediction for any upper gastrointestinal cancers diagnosed via endoscopy would be most informative.

Residential greenness, a fundamental component of urban design, has been shown to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders. The present study investigates the association between residential green exposure and prevalence of major depressive disorders using a large and diverse cross-sectional dataset from the UK Biobank.  Methods In this cross-sectional, observational, associational study, we used baseline data from the UK Biobank cohort of participants aged 37–73 years from across the UK. Environmental exposure data were derived from a modelled and linked built environment database. Residential greenness was assessed with a 0·5 m resolution Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, which is derived from spectral reflectance measurements in remotely sensed colour infrared data and measured within geocoded dwelling catchments. Other environment metrics included street-level movement density, terrain, and fine particulate exposures. A series of logistic models examined associations between residential greenness and odds of major depressive disorder after adjusting for activity-influencing environments and individual covariates.""",Yes,"""Findings Of 122 993 participants with data on major depressive disorder, the study analytical sample comprised 94 879 (77·1%) participants recruited across ten UK Biobank assessment centres between April 29, 2009, and Oct 1, 2010. A protective effect of greenness on depression was consistently observed, with 4·0% lower odds of major depressive disorder per interquartile increment in Normalised Difference Vegetation Index greenness (odds ratio 0·960, 95% CI 0·93–0·99; p=0·0044). Interaction analyses indicated that the beneficial effects of greenness were more pronounced among women, participants younger than 60 years, and participants residing in areas with low neighbourhood socioeconomic status or high urbanicity.  Interpretation The results point to the benefits of well designed green environments on mental health. Further longitudinal studies are needed to decipher causal pathways. In the UK, policies aimed at optimising allocation and design of green spaces might help preserve psychological ecosystem services, thereby, improving the mental wellbeing of populations and enhancing the mental capital of cities.""",Yes,"""Introduction Given the present unprecedented rate of urbanisation, about 60% of the global population are predicted to reside in cities by 2030, with one in every three people living in cities with at least half a million inhabitants.1 Typically, cities are characterised by highly dense, impervious, built-up spaces and a scarcity of natural environments, with the associated potential effects on mental health. Dynamic stress vulnerability models have reported links between reduced exposure to green environments and enhanced vulnerability to the negative health effects of stressful life events, which can result in increments in the proportion of the population with mental disorders and an overall reduction in the mental capital of cities.2, 3, 4 In recent years, mental disorders, including mood disorders, have emerged as a leading cause of global disease burden. They also act as risk factors for the development of communicable and non-communicable diseases, and contribute to accidental and non-accidental injuries.5, 6, 7 The UK's total annual expenditure on brain disorders was estimated to be approximately €134 billion in 2010, of which €19·24 billion was incurred on mood disorders, accounting for approximately 3·9 million annual cases or 8·73% of all brain disorders.8  The causes of mental health disorders are complex, with a long latency between exposures and subsequent incidence and progression. A systems-based life course approach towards enhancing the mental capital of cities and wellbeing of their populations has been proposed.9 The importance of such a holistic approach has been emphasised by the inclusion of mental health within the Sustainable Development Goals.10, 11 Relatedly, exposure to residential green environment has also been regarded as an effective upstream-level urban intervention with an aim to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders.12  Research in context  Evidence before this study  We searched online databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO, Scopus, and Google/Google Scholar databases, for studies and reports published in English between Jan 1, 1984, and Feb 10, 2018, using a combination of search terms, including “residential greenness”, “green space”, “NDVI”, or “built environment”, and “mental health”, “depression”, or “major depressive disorder”.  Mental health disorders have emerged as a leading cause of the global burden of disease. At the same time, the present unprecedented pace of urbanisation and an increasing proportion of impervious built-up spaces in our cities have resulted in reduced exposures to salutogenic green environments. Several studies have examined the links between exposure to green environments and mental health, with most studies suggesting beneficial effects. Green exposure has been measured in terms of access to green spaces (proportion of green spaces within a residential neighbourhood) as well as the general salutogenic potential of green environments. The protective effects of residential green have been hypothesised to originate from one or more of its functional roles: as restorative stress-relieving spaces; supportive social interaction spaces promoting a sense of community; active living spaces facilitating physical activity; and natural filters ameliorating the adverse effects of negative exposures such as air, noise, and thermal pollution.  Notwithstanding the evidence generated so far, the links between residential green exposure and mental health still remain equivocal in adults. Many of the studies linking residential green exposure with mental health have used coarse measures of green exposure, whereas a few studies have used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index as an index of salutogenic green, although of low-to-moderate spatial resolution. Most studies so far have been small scale and done in homogeneous environmental settings, resulting in limited statistical power and generalisability....Some studies report a beneficial effect of contact with green environments on health, in general,13, 14, 15 and more specifically, with regard to stress, mood, and mental health.16, 17 Several studies have established a protective independent association between various indicators of mental health and the percentage of green space within a residential neighbourhood,18, 19, 20, 21 the amount of tree cover in an urban area,22 and the overall exposure of individuals to salutogenic green environments.23, 24, 25 These protective effects of residential green spaces have been explained in terms of four mechanisms related to their specific functional roles: restorative, stress-relieving spaces;4, 26, 27, 28 supportive, social interaction spaces that promote a sense of community;29 active living spaces that facilitate physical activity;30, 31, 32 and natural filters that ameliorate the adverse effects of air, noise, and thermal pollution.33, 34, 35  Despite the substantial body of evidence, the links between residential green exposure and mental health still remain far from conclusive in adults.17 Many of the studies have used coarse measures of green exposure, expressed as a proportion of greenness based on land cover maps within a specific catchment or census geography, thereby neglecting to include private gardens, street trees, and green spaces that do not meet a specific criterion, such as a size threshold, and hindering the study's replicability and comparability. A few studies have used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an index of greenery derived from Landsat satellite data, as an overall measure of green exposure (although at a low-to-moderate resolution). Most studies so far have been small scale and done in homogeneous environmental settings, resulting in limited statistical power and generalisability. Furthermore, most studies do not adjust for other aspects of activity-influencing built environment and individual-level confounding effects, or consider interaction effects.""",Yes,"""Despite the substantial body of evidence, the links between residential green exposure and mental health still remain far from conclusive in adults.17 Many of the studies have used coarse measures of green exposure, expressed as a proportion of greenness based on land cover maps within a specific catchment or census geography, thereby neglecting to include private gardens, street trees, and green spaces that do not meet a specific criterion, such as a size threshold, and hindering the study's replicability and comparability.

UKBUMP is a high-resolution spatial database of health-influencing environment exposures modelled within multiscale residential neighbourhoods of each UK Biobank participant's geocoded dwelling. Environmental exposure metrics were developed through spatial and network analyses of data from multiple UK-wide spatial databases, resulting in multiple exposure variables related to greenness, urban density, destination accessibility, street-level accessibility, terrain, and deprivation.43, 44 Briefly, UKBUMP was developed by geocoding participants' dwelling addresses to the level of building footprints, delineating multiscale dwelling neighbourhoods by defining street network buffers centred on the geocoded dwelling locations in ArcGIS12 Network Analyst, and measuring environmental exposures within these functional neighbourhoods. After linking the exposure metrics to the participants' dwelling locations, the data were reanonymised. Accurate data on building-level land uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated Transport Network databases, whereas residential greenness was modelled from high-resolution (50 × 50 cm2) colour infrared data captured during aerial photography with the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4.43  Residential greenness Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank participants' dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote sensing device. Chlorophyll in healthy vegetation absorbs radiation in the visible red region (630–690 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflects radiation in the near-infrared region (760–900 nm). This differential in the absorbance and reflectance of wavelengths by chlorophyll is used as a proxy for green quality and intensity. The differential is measured using the following formula:   The formula includes the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the visible (RED) and near-infrared regions (NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Index scores range between −1 and 1, with higher values indicating higher densities of green vegetation.  In the present study, NDVI greenness was derived from a series of 0·5 m resolution, colour-infrared imagery collected by Bluesky (Ashby-De-La-Zouch, UK) with the help of specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Summer-time images of the study areas collected over similar temporal scales (across the baseline phase of the UK Biobank study) were stitched together to avoid temporal mismatch. After excluding large water bodies, we modelled mean NDVI within a 500 m residential buffer of each UK Biobank participant. Selection of a 500 m catchment area for measuring residential green exposures was based on our previous studies46, 47 and on other previous reports48, 49 that used a quarter mile (400–500 m) neighbourhood for measuring NDVI greenness.""",NA,Not used,Yes,"""Physical environment Among the physical environment exposures, terrain was modelled in ArcGIS12 Spatial Analyst from a 5 m resolution Bluesky digital terrain model and expressed as variability (SD) of slope, in degrees, within a 0·5 km residential catchment of UK Biobank participants' dwellings. As such, the metric is able to differentiate between flat and hilly surface within the residential catchment.  Exposure to PM2·5 obtained from UK Biobank's linked air pollution exposure data was used as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution. The measurement was based on monitoring on three occasions over a 14 day period during the cold, warm, and intermediate seasons of the year. Individual annual exposure to particulate matter concentrations around geocoded residential addresses was derived from land-use regression models.50  Built environment Built-environment metrics from UKBUMP were assessed within a 1 km street catchment of participants' dwellings. Street-level movement density was modelled in terms of through-movement potential of the street segments, also termed as betweenness centrality in graph theoretic terminology. The method has been used in active living research and described elsewhere.51, 52 The UK-wide street network data for the study area comprised approximately 4 million street segments, which were extracted from the OS MasterMap Integrated Transport Network database, transcribed into an access graph model, and subjected to network analysis in sDNA53 to model street-level movement density.

Panel UK Biobank study's diagnostic criteria for classification of lifetime experience of probable major depressive disorders40, 41  Single probable episode of major depressive disorder  Ever depressed or down for a whole week; plus at least 2 weeks' duration; plus only one episode; plus ever seen a general practitioner or a psychiatrist for “nerves, anxiety, depression” OR ever anhedonic (unenthusiasm or uninterest) for a whole week; plus at least 2 weeks' duration; plus only one episode; plus ever seen a general practitioner or a psychiatrist for “nerves, anxiety, depression”  Probable recurrent major depressive disorder (moderate)  Ever depressed or down for a whole week; plus at least 2 weeks' duration; plus at least two episodes; plus ever seen a general practitioner (but not a psychiatrist) for “nerves, anxiety, depression” OR ever anhedonic (unenthusiasm or uninterest) for a whole week; plus at least 2 weeks' duration; plus at least two episodes; plus ever seen a general practitioner (but not a psychiatrist) for “nerves, anxiety, depression”  Probable recurrent major depressive disorder (severe)  Ever depressed or down for a whole week; plus at least 2 weeks' duration; plus at least two episodes; plus ever seen a psychiatrist for “nerves, anxiety, depression” OR ever anhedonic (unenthusiasm or uninterest) for a whole week; plus at least 2 weeks' duration; plus at least two episodes; plus ever seen a psychiatrist for “nerves, anxiety, depression”  Measurement of residential environment exposures Residential environment exposure data were derived from the UK Biobank Urban Morphometric Platform (UKBUMP). UKBUMP is a high-resolution spatial database of health-influencing environment exposures modelled within multiscale residential neighbourhoods of each UK Biobank participant's geocoded dwelling. Environmental exposure metrics were developed through spatial and network analyses of data from multiple UK-wide spatial databases, resulting in multiple exposure variables related to greenness, urban density, destination accessibility, street-level accessibility, terrain, and deprivation.43, 44 Briefly, UKBUMP was developed by geocoding participants' dwelling addresses to the level of building footprints, delineating multiscale dwelling neighbourhoods by defining street network buffers centred on the geocoded dwelling locations in ArcGIS12 Network Analyst, and measuring environmental exposures within these functional neighbourhoods. After linking the exposure metrics to the participants' dwelling locations, the data were reanonymised. Accurate data on building-level land uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated Transport Network databases, whereas residential greenness was modelled from high-resolution (50 × 50 cm2) colour infrared data captured during aerial photography with the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4.43  Residential greenness Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank participants' dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote sensing device. Chlorophyll in healthy vegetation absorbs radiation in the visible red region (630–690 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflects radiation in the near-infrared region (760–900 nm). This differential in the absorbance and reflectance of wavelengths by chlorophyll is used as a proxy for green quality and intensity. The differential is measured using the following formula:   The formula includes the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the visible (RED) and near-infrared regions (NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Index scores range between −1 and 1, with higher values indicating higher densities of green vegetation.  In the present study, NDVI greenness was derived from a series of 0·5 m resolution, colour-infrared imagery collected by Bluesky (Ashby-De-La-Zouch, UK) with the help of specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Summer-time images of the study areas collected over similar temporal scales (across the baseline phase of the UK Biobank study) were stitched together to avoid temporal mismatch. After excluding large water bodies, we modelled mean NDVI within a 500 m residential buffer of each UK Biobank participant. Selection of a 500 m catchment area for measuring residential green exposures was based on our previous studies46, 47 and on other previous reports48, 49 that used a quarter mile (400–500 m) neighbourhood for measuring NDVI greenness.  Physical environment Among the physical environment exposures, terrain was modelled in ArcGIS12 Spatial Analyst from a 5 m resolution Bluesky digital terrain model and expressed as variability (SD) of slope, in degrees, within a 0·5 km residential catchment of UK Biobank participants' dwellings. As such, the metric is able to differentiate between flat and hilly surface within the residential catchment.  Exposure to PM2·5 obtained from UK Biobank's linked air pollution exposure data was used as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution. The measurement was based on monitoring on three occasions over a 14 day period during the cold, warm, and intermediate seasons of the year. Individual annual exposure to particulate matter concentrations around geocoded residential addresses was derived from land-use regression models.50  Built environment Built-environment metrics from UKBUMP were assessed within a 1 km street catchment of participants' dwellings. Street-level movement density was modelled in terms of through-movement potential of the street segments, also termed as betweenness centrality in graph theoretic terminology. The method has been used in active living research and described elsewhere.51, 52 The UK-wide street network data for the study area comprised approximately 4 million street segments, which were extracted from the OS MasterMap Integrated Transport Network database, transcribed into an access graph model, and subjected to network analysis in sDNA53 to model street-level movement density. Movement density is expressed as the simulated counts of movement through each link in the network, given its relative position and topological connectivity with other segments within the network. The measure also acts as a proxy for relative accessibility and centrality of a place. Betweenness centrality of x in a graph of N links might be defined as:  ɛ ɛ  In the formula, y and z are the geodesic endpoints; Ry is the set of links within a defined neighbourhood catchment from y; L(y) is the length of link y and L(z) is the length of link z; and P(z) is the proportion of link z within the defined radius.  The origin-destination function (OD) is defined as:   An objective index of urbanicity within a 1 km residential catchment was developed from the UKBUMP built-environment variables to investigate associations between residential greenness and major depressive disorder, stratified by urbanicity quartiles. Urbanicity was defined as:   The formula includes the density of residential housing (resid), retail (retail), and public transport (PT) in units per km2 street catchment, in addition to street-level movement density (street movement).  Individual-level covariates On the basis of previous scientific literature, the study adjusted for demographic covariates (age, sex, highest educational qualification, and employment status), smoking status, and prevalent comorbidities (body-mass index [BMI] status, doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease, and diabetes).  Socioeconomic status was assessed at household and neighbourhood levels in terms of mean annual household income before tax and Townsend deprivation index scores,54 which is a composite index of four postcode-level socioeconomic status variables (household overcrowding, unemployment, non-home ownership, and non-car ownership), with a higher score indicative of lower neighbourhood socioeconomic status.  We used participation in leisure and social activities as a proxy for social interaction and support. Level of participation was based on response to the questionnaire: “Which of the following do you attend once a week or more often? (You can select more than one)”; with available responses being none; pub or social club; religious group; sports club or gym; and adult education class or other group activity. Responses were converted into a six-factor variable: none, pub or social club, religious group, sports club or gym, adult education class and other, and combination of two or more activities.  Statistical analyses The prevalence of lifetime experience of probable major depressive disorder was modelled as a two factor variable (case or non-case) as per UK Biobank's assessment protocol. Age was coded as a three-factor variable (38–50 years, 51–60 years, or 61–73 years) and sex as a two-factor variable (female or male). Highest educational attainment was defined as a five-factor variable (none; O levels, GCSEs, or CSEs; A levels or AS levels; NVQ, HND, HNC, or other professional qualification; or college or university degree) and employment as a three-factor variable (employed; retired; or unemployed, home maker, or other). Mean annual household income before tax was expressed as a four-factor variable (<£18 000, £18 000–£30 999, £31 000–£51 999, or ≥£52 000). The household income data were available for 82 839 participants in the analytical sample. Townsend scores were categorised into quintiles and used as a five-factor variable. Smoking status was coded as non-smoker, previous smoker, and current smoker. Doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease was transformed into a four-factor variable (none; high blood pressure; heart attack, angina, or stroke; or both high blood pressure and heart attack, angina, or stroke) and diabetes was coded as a two-factor variables (yes or no). Measured BMI status was expressed as a three-factor variable (<25 kg/m2; ≥25 kg/m2 and <30 kg/m2; or ≥30 kg/m2).

The classification and definition of lifetime history of mood disorders in UK Biobank was based on structured and validated diagnostic criteria reported previously.40, 41 Briefly, the assessment of major depressive disorder comprised items relating to lifetime experience of minor or major depression, items from the Patient Health Questionnaire, and items related to social support for mental health.40, 42 As such, the binary outcome variable comprised participants with no lifetime experience of major depressive disorder (0 or “no case”) and participants who had experienced a major depressive disorder (1 or “case”). The criteria for participants who had experienced a major depressive disorder included those who had experienced a single probable lifetime episode of major depression, probable recurrent major depression (moderate), or probable recurrent major depression (severe), or any combination thereof (panel).

UKBUMP is a high-resolution spatial database of health-influencing environment exposures modelled within multiscale residential neighbourhoods of each UK Biobank participant's geocoded dwelling. Environmental exposure metrics were developed through spatial and network analyses of data from multiple UK-wide spatial databases, resulting in multiple exposure variables related to greenness, urban density, destination accessibility, street-level accessibility, terrain, and deprivation.43, 44 Briefly, UKBUMP was developed by geocoding participants' dwelling addresses to the level of building footprints, delineating multiscale dwelling neighbourhoods by defining street network buffers centred on the geocoded dwelling locations in ArcGIS12 Network Analyst, and measuring environmental exposures within these functional neighbourhoods. After linking the exposure metrics to the participants' dwelling locations, the data were reanonymised. Accurate data on building-level land uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated Transport Network databases, whereas residential greenness was modelled from high-resolution (50 × 50 cm2) colour infrared data captured during aerial photography with the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4.43  Residential greenness Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank participants' dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote sensing device. Chlorophyll in healthy vegetation absorbs radiation in the visible red region (630–690 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflects radiation in the near-infrared region (760–900 nm). This differential in the absorbance and reflectance of wavelengths by chlorophyll is used as a proxy for green quality and intensity. The differential is measured using the following formula:   The formula includes the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the visible (RED) and near-infrared regions (NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Index scores range between −1 and 1, with higher values indicating higher densities of green vegetation.  In the present study, NDVI greenness was derived from a series of 0·5 m resolution, colour-infrared imagery collected by Bluesky (Ashby-De-La-Zouch, UK) with the help of specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Summer-time images of the study areas collected over similar temporal scales (across the baseline phase of the UK Biobank study) were stitched together to avoid temporal mismatch. After excluding large water bodies, we modelled mean NDVI within a 500 m residential buffer of each UK Biobank participant. Selection of a 500 m catchment area for measuring residential green exposures was based on our previous studies46, 47 and on other previous reports48, 49 that used a quarter mile (400–500 m) neighbourhood for measuring NDVI greenness.  Physical environment Among the physical environment exposures, terrain was modelled in ArcGIS12 Spatial Analyst from a 5 m resolution Bluesky digital terrain model and expressed as variability (SD) of slope, in degrees, within a 0·5 km residential catchment of UK Biobank participants' dwellings. As such, the metric is able to differentiate between flat and hilly surface within the residential catchment.  Exposure to PM2·5 obtained from UK Biobank's linked air pollution exposure data was used as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution. The measurement was based on monitoring on three occasions over a 14 day period during the cold, warm, and intermediate seasons of the year. Individual annual exposure to particulate matter concentrations around geocoded residential addresses was derived from land-use regression models.50  Built environment Built-environment metrics from UKBUMP were assessed within a 1 km street catchment of participants' dwellings. Street-level movement density was modelled in terms of through-movement potential of the street segments, also termed as betweenness centrality in graph theoretic terminology. The method has been used in active living research and described elsewhere.51, 52 The UK-wide street network data for the study area comprised approximately 4 million street segments, which were extracted from the OS MasterMap Integrated Transport Network database, transcribed into an access graph model, and subjected to network analysis in sDNA53 to model street-level movement density. Movement density is expressed as the simulated counts of movement through each link in the network, given its relative position and topological connectivity with other segments within the network. The measure also acts as a proxy for relative accessibility and centrality of a place. Betweenness centrality of x in a graph of N links might be defined as:  ɛ ɛ  In the formula, y and z are the geodesic endpoints; Ry is the set of links within a defined neighbourhood catchment from y; L(y) is the length of link y and L(z) is the length of link z; and P(z) is the proportion of link z within the defined radius.  The origin-destination function (OD) is defined as:   An objective index of urbanicity within a 1 km residential catchment was developed from the UKBUMP built-environment variables to investigate associations between residential greenness and major depressive disorder, stratified by urbanicity quartiles. Urbanicity was defined as:   The formula includes the density of residential housing (resid), retail (retail), and public transport (PT) in units per km2 street catchment, in addition to street-level movement density (street movement).  Individual-level covariates On the basis of previous scientific literature, the study adjusted for demographic covariates (age, sex, highest educational qualification, and employment status), smoking status, and prevalent comorbidities (body-mass index [BMI] status, doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease, and diabetes).  Socioeconomic status was assessed at household and neighbourhood levels in terms of mean annual household income before tax and Townsend deprivation index scores,54 which is a composite index of four postcode-level socioeconomic status variables (household overcrowding, unemployment, non-home ownership, and non-car ownership), with a higher score indicative of lower neighbourhood socioeconomic status.  We used participation in leisure and social activities as a proxy for social interaction and support. Level of participation was based on response to the questionnaire: “Which of the following do you attend once a week or more often? (You can select more than one)”; with available responses being none; pub or social club; religious group; sports club or gym; and adult education class or other group activity. Responses were converted into a six-factor variable: none, pub or social club, religious group, sports club or gym, adult education class and other, and combination of two or more activities.  Statistical analyses The prevalence of lifetime experience of probable major depressive disorder was modelled as a two factor variable (case or non-case) as per UK Biobank's assessment protocol. Age was coded as a three-factor variable (38–50 years, 51–60 years, or 61–73 years) and sex as a two-factor variable (female or male). Highest educational attainment was defined as a five-factor variable (none; O levels, GCSEs, or CSEs; A levels or AS levels; NVQ, HND, HNC, or other professional qualification; or college or university degree) and employment as a three-factor variable (employed; retired; or unemployed, home maker, or other). Mean annual household income before tax was expressed as a four-factor variable (<£18 000, £18 000–£30 999, £31 000–£51 999, or ≥£52 000). The household income data were available for 82 839 participants in the analytical sample. Townsend scores were categorised into quintiles and used as a five-factor variable. Smoking status was coded as non-smoker, previous smoker, and current smoker. Doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease was transformed into a four-factor variable (none; high blood pressure; heart attack, angina, or stroke; or both high blood pressure and heart attack, angina, or stroke) and diabetes was coded as a two-factor variables (yes or no). Measured BMI status was expressed as a three-factor variable (<25 kg/m2; ≥25 kg/m2 and <30 kg/m2; or ≥30 kg/m2). Terrain variability and walkability (expressed as movement density) were transformed into quartiles.  The study followed a multi-layered analyses strategy.

However, no one has examined whether chronotype is associated with mortality risk to date. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that being an evening type is associated with increased mortality in a large cohort study, the UK Biobank. Our analysis included 433 268 adults aged 38–73 at the time of enrolment and an average 6.5-year follow-up. The primary exposure was chronotype, as assessed through a single self-reported question-defining participants as definite morning types, moderate morning types, moderate evening types or definite evening types. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and mortality due to CVD. Prevalent disease was also compared among the chronotype groups. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, body mass index, sleep duration, socioeconomic status and comorbidities.""",Yes,"""Greater eveningness, particularly being a definite evening type, was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of all comorbidities. Comparing definite evening type to definite morning type, the associations were strongest for psychological disorders (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.86–2.02, p = < 0.001), followed by diabetes (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.24–1.36, p = < 0.001), neurological disorders (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.20–1.30, p = < 0.001), gastrointestinal/abdominal disorders (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.19–1.27, p = < 0.001) and respiratory disorders (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.18–1.26, p = < 0.001). The total number of deaths was 10 534, out of which 2127 were due to CVD. Greater eveningness, based on chronotype as an ordinal variable, was associated with a small increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.004–1.05, p = 0.017) and CVD mortality (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00–1.09, p = 0.06). Compared to definite morning types, definite evening types had significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02–1.18, p = 0.012). This first report of increased mortality in evening types is consistent with previous reports of increased levels of cardiometabolic risk factors in this group. Mortality risk in evening types may be due to behavioural, psychological and physiological risk factors, many of which may be attributable to chronic misalignment between internal physiological timing and externally imposed timing of work and social activities. These findings suggest the need for researching possible interventions aimed at either modifying circadian rhythms in individuals or at allowing evening types greater working hour flexibility.""",No,"""Introduction Identifying novel,potentially modifiable, life-style factors associated with increased morbidity and mortality can lead to innovative strategies for improving health. We investigated a measure of chronotype, which is an estimate of the general part of the day (ranging between morning and evening) that a person prefers for their daily activities. Later chronotype (i.e. evening preference) and later timing of sleep (which is associated with later chronotype) have been associated with morbidity, including higher rates of metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Reutrakul and Knutson 2015; Merikanto et al. 2013; Yu et al. 2015; Koopman et al. 2017) and psychiatric symptoms (Jankowski 2016; Melo et al. 2017; Putilov 2017). In the UK Biobank Study, a large prospective cohort study, a preference for evening was also associated with more cardiovascular risk factors, such as higher rates of smoking and overweight/obesity (Patterson et al. 2017).  Current evidence therefore implicates later chronotype (i.e. being a self-described “evening person”) in the risk of a variety of diseases.

Specifically, participants were asked to report any illnesses they had and if the participant was uncertain of the type of illness he/she had, they described it to the interviewer (a trained nurse) who attempted to code it. If the illness could not be coded during the interview, the interviewer entered a free-text description, which was subsequently reviewed by a physician and, where possible, matched to codes. Using these codes, cases of self-reported CVD, diabetes, other endocrine disorders, neurological disorders, renal disorders, respiratory disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, gastrointestinal/abdominal disorders and psychological disorders were identified (see Supplemental Table 1).  Covariates in the model were selected based on the potential to confound associations between chronotype and mortality. These covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status (SES), sleep duration and comorbidities. Age at baseline assessment was calculated in years based on date of birth. Three age bins were defined based on previous analyses of UK Biobank data (Ganna and Ingelsson 2015): 37–52, 53–62 and 63–73 years. Sex (male/female) and ethnicity were self-identified. Since a large majority of the sample (94%) self-identified as “white”, we dichotomised ethnicity into “white” and “non-white”. Smoking status was obtained by self-report with the following categories: “never”, “previous smoker”, “current smoker” and “prefer not to answer”. Standing height was measured using a Seca 240-cm height measure while participants stood barefoot with posture verified by trained staff. Weight was measured using a Tanita BC418MA body composition analyser and BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m²). SES was based on the Townsend deprivation index (Townsend et al. 1988), which was calculated immediately prior to participants joining UK Biobank and was based on the preceding national census output areas. Each participant was assigned a score based on their postcode.  Finally, sleep duration came from the touch screen interview based on the question, “About how many hours sleep do you get in every 24 hours (please include naps)?” and responses were provided as integers....We also created interaction terms between chronotype (ordinal variable) and both sex and the three age groups to test for differences in associations between mortality and chronotype.""",Partially-External,"""Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality and mortality due to CVD.

However, key environmental determinants of chronotype are potentially modifiable by interventions aimed at advancing circadian phase, such as administration of light in the morning and of melatonin in the evening. Another strategy to improve health of evening types would be to adjust work schedules to suit individual chronotype. It is also worth noting that daylight savings time (DST)/summer time places a further burden on individuals who are already struggling with the dictates of social norms on when to start the working day, and the switch to DST, which is perceived as more uncomfortable by evening types than by morning types (Nascimento De Alencar et al. 2017; Kantermann et al. 2007), also coincided with greater incidence of cardiovascular events (Jiddou et al. 2013).

Methods We used prospective follow-up data from the UK Biobank cohort study to assess self-reported isolation (a three-item scale) and loneliness (two questions). The main outcomes were all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We calculated the percentage of excess risk mediated by risk factors to assess the extent to which the associations of social isolation and loneliness with mortality were attributable to differences between isolated and lonely individuals and others in biological (body-mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and handgrip strength), behavioural (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity), socioeconomic (education, neighbourhood deprivation, and household income), and psychological (depressive symptoms and cognitive capacity) risk factors.""",Yes,"""Findings 466 901 men and women (mean age at baseline 56·5 years [SD 8·1]) were included in the analyses, with a mean follow-up of 6·5 years (SD 0·8).

The minimally adjusted hazard ratio for mortality risk related to loneliness was 1·38 (95% CI 1·30–1·47), which reduced to 0·99 (95% CI 0·93–1·06) after full adjustment for baseline risks.

However, few extensive prospective data exist on which to test these hypotheses and assess the associations in different groups such as old and young individuals, low and high socioeconomic groups, and those with and without chronic disease.

We examined the associations of social isolation and loneliness with all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazard models with age as a timescale. Associations with cause-specific mortality were examined using competing-risks survival regression (based on Fine and Gray's proportional sub-hazards model), which is the appropriate method for estimation of competing actual risks.19 All the models were adjusted for age, sex, and ethnic origin, with additional adjustment for chronic disease. To measure the robustness of these associations, we did additional subgroup analyses separately for men and women, three age groups (37–52 years, 53–60 years, and 61–73 years), different ethnic groups (white vs non-white), and participants with and without chronic disease at baseline. Subgroup analyses by sex, age, ethnic origin, and chronic disease were chosen because these factors represent potential confounders for the association between social relations and mortality. Men, individuals belonging to ethnic minorities, elderly people, and those with long-standing illness tend to have fewer social relations and also are at increased risk of mortality.4,  6 Similar three-level age categorisations have been used in a previous study based on UK Biobank data.20 To assess the extent to which baseline biological, behavioural, socioeconomic, psychological, and health-related risk factors explained the associations of social isolation and loneliness with mortality, we calculated the percentage of excess risk mediated (PERM) for the following five groups of explanatory variables: (1) biological (BMI, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and handgrip strength); (2) behavioural (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity); (3) socioeconomic (Townsend deprivation index, education, and household income); (4) psychological factors (depressive symptoms and cognitive performance); and (5) self-rated health.

Finally, all the risk factors were included in the same model simultaneously (final model). To assess the extent to which the associations followed a dose–response pattern, we did dose–response analyses using sum scores from the individual items of the isolation and loneliness measures. We analysed isolation and loneliness separately to assess whether there was a pattern across the continuous score as a predictor of mortality. We accounted for missing data by multiple imputation by chained equations, which generated five imputed datasets.22 The imputation model included age, sex, social isolation, loneliness, all confounding and mediating variables, the Nelson-Aalen estimate of cumulative hazard, and survival status.23 We fitted Cox proportional hazards models within each imputed dataset and combined them in accordance with Rubin's rules.

To date, studies investigating possible associations between birth weight and bipolar disorder (BD), or personality traits known to predispose to affective disorders such as neuroticism, have not been conducted in large cohorts.  Aims To assess whether very low birth weight (<1500 g) and low birth weight (1500–2490 g) were associated with higher neuroticism scores assessed in middle age, and lifetime history of either MDD or BD. We controlled for possible confounding factors.  Method Retrospective cohort study using baseline data on the 83 545 UK Biobank participants with detailed mental health and birth weight data. Main outcomes were prevalent MDD and BD, and neuroticism assessed using the Eysenck Personality Inventory Neuroticism scale - Revised (EPIN-R)""",Partially,"No numerical results ""Results Referent to normal birth weight, very low/low birth weight were associated with higher neuroticism scores, increased MDD and BD. The associations between birth weight category and MDD were partially mediated by higher neuroticism.  Conclusions These findings suggest that intrauterine programming may play a role in lifetime vulnerability to affective disorders.""",Yes,"""Previous studies have reported associations between low birth weight (under 2500 g) and risk of cardiometabolic disease 1 and some psychiatric disorders. 2 Associations between low birth weight and bipolar disorder (BD) have not been reported, and associations with personality traits such as neuroticism have only been investigated in small studies that focused on very low birth weight, 3 extremely low birth weight 4 or specifically preterm participants 5 (e.g. range n=71–158). 3–5 The hypothesis of a possible causal association with cardiometabolic disease and psychiatric disorders has been variously termed the ‘Barker hypothesis’, the ‘foetal origins hypothesis’ or the ‘developmental origins of adult health and disease hypothesis’. 6 This hypothesis suggests that as a result of fetal plasticity, the fetus is able to undergo physiological adaptations in response to an adverse intrauterine environment; for example, poor early nutrition may adjust glucose–insulin metabolism to maximise possible fitness. Whereas this may potentially protect against early mortality, it may have negative sequelae in later life, including susceptibility to some chronic diseases. 7  Low birth weight and MDD A recent meta-analysis which pooled assessments of the association between low birth weight and risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) derived in 18 separate studies, comprising a total of 59 442 participants, did not find evidence for an association once publication bias was taken into account. 2 The authors noted significant heterogeneity between studies, including wide age ranges of participants, different outcome measures, inadequate follow-up rates and low power. Studies also often failed to control for important potential confounders such as maternal smoking or maternal MDD, socioeconomic status, gestational age, gender and family history of MDD, and some studies included extremely low birth weight (<1000 g) participants from specialist hospital environments.

We were also able to assess the associations between birth weight and neuroticism scores, and risk of BD in adulthood.

There were clear trends whereby the risk of all three increased with reducing birth weight, from normal to very low. Tests of mediation showed that the association between birth weight and MDD was partially mediated by its association with neuroticism.  We found a significant association between low birth weight and higher neuroticism, which survived adjustment for relevant covariates. There was a significant dose effect, such that lower birth weight was associated with higher neuroticism in adulthood (i.e. very low>low>normal). The birth weight/neuroticism associations were characterised by relatively small effect sizes: around a 0.20–0.30 increase in neuroticism scores (out of 12) for low/very low v. normal birth weight. Given the large sample size, statistical significance may not be clinically meaningful, in terms of being a risk factor for MDD/BD.  We found a significant association between low/very low birth weight and increased risk of MDD. This survived adjustment for potential confounding variables and physical disorder history. There appeared to be dose effect, with lower birth weight being associated with higher MDD rates. We found a similar dose effect association for BD. When we separately contrasted very low and low birth weight categories with normal birth weight, we found a significant association between very low birth weight and risk of BD in the unadjusted and confounder- but not mediator-adjusted model (i.e. additionally corrected for physical disorders). Note that sample sizes for the BD analyses were relatively small, and this may contribute to non-significant P-values where the relevant effect sizes are similar or even stronger than in the MDD results.""",Yes,"""The birth weight data in UK Biobank were obtained by asking the participants to recall it in late adulthood. Whereas actual recorded data would be preferable as recall will be subject to inherent noise/error – Inskip et al 24 showed that Bland-Altman plots revealed reasonable agreement between the recalled weight (at assessment) and recorded (hospital record-based) birth weights in 1729 women (Spearman rank r=0.87), although this was in young women. This nonetheless suggests that recalled birth weight is reasonably accurate; when people can recall their birth weight, their recall is quite good, but many, of course, were excluded from these analyses as their birth weight was unknown. It is possible that certain recall biases influence our final results; for example, perhaps participants with chronic illnesses are more likely to recall information such as maternal depression or smoking. There was a significant association between likelihood of reporting birth weight (v. not) and probable MDD/BD; however, this was modest.

We did not control for multiple births which may contribute to the prevalence of low birth weight in the sample; however, we are not aware of multiple pregnancies being a risk factor for MDD/neuroticism independent of any effect of low birth weight, and it therefore might not act as a confounder.  Participants with lifetime histories of depression may have been less likely to participate in UK Biobank research, and this may interact with other variables such as lower socioeconomic status; the sample may not be entirely representative of psychiatric disease prevalence in a range of different backgrounds.

We investigated predictors of mortality in UK Biobank participants during a 5 year period. We aimed to investigate the associations between most of the available measurements and 5 year all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and to develop and validate a prediction score for 5 year mortality using only self-reported information.  Methods Participants were enrolled in the UK Biobank from April, 2007, to July, 2010, from 21 assessment centres across England, Wales, and Scotland with standardised procedures. In this prospective population-based study, we assessed sex-specific associations of 655 measurements of demographics, health, and lifestyle with all-cause mortality and six cause-specific mortality categories in UK Biobank participants using the Cox proportional hazard model. We excluded variables that were missing in more than 80% of the participants and all cardiorespiratory fitness test measurements because summary data were not available. Validation of the prediction score was done in participants enrolled at the Scottish centres.

Of 498 103 UK Biobank participants included (54% of whom were women) aged 37–73 years, 8532 (39% of whom were women) died during a median follow-up of 4·9 years (IQR 4·33–5·22). Self-reported health (C-index including age 0·74 [95% CI 0·73–0·75]) was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in men and a previous cancer diagnosis (0·73 [0·72–0·74]) was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in women. When excluding individuals with major diseases or disorders (Charlson comorbidity index >0; n=355 043), measures of smoking habits were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality. The prognostic score including 13 self-reported predictors for men and 11 for women achieved good discrimination (0·80 [0·77–0·83] for men and 0·79 [0·76–0·83] for women) and significantly outperformed the Charlson comorbidity index (p<0·0001 in men and p=0·0007 in women). A dedicated website allows the interactive exploration of all results along with calculation of individual risk through an online questionnaire.  Interpretation Measures that can simply be obtained by questionnaires and without physical examination were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality in the UK Biobank population. The prediction score we have developed accurately predicts 5 year all-cause mortality and can be used by individuals to improve health awareness, and by health professionals and organisations to identify high-risk individuals and guide public policy.""",Yes,"""Adequate identification and risk stratification of individuals with reduced life expectancy, especially in the middle-aged to elderly population, is an important public health priority1 and a central issue in clinical decision making. Epidemiological studies that obtain several measurements through questionnaires, physical assessments, and biological samples can be done to compare the prognostic value of risk factors of short-term mortality and provide new hypotheses about health determinants. Moreover, these risk factors can be combined into a prognostic index to provide information about individual mortality risk or other health-related measures. Traditionally, association with mortality has been studied for one risk factor at a time,2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and the few studies that have investigated more than one risk factor did not assess different causes of death and based their analyses on small study samples.7 Several prognostic indices for short-term mortality exist, but they have mainly been developed for and assessed in older individuals or in high-risk populations.8, 9 Furthermore, the small sample sizes and the small number of risk factors investigated are the main limitations of all previous studies.""",Yes,"""The UK Biobank project10 includes about 500 000 men and women aged 40–70 years.

We assessed the sex‐specific relationships and their differences between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI).  Methods and Results Between 2006 and 2010, the UK Biobank recruited over 500 000 participants aged 40 to 69 years across the United Kingdom. During 7 years of follow‐up, 5710 cases of MI (28% women) were recorded among 265 988 women and 213 622 men without a history of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Cox regression models yielded adjusted hazard ratios for MI associated with body mass index, waist circumference, waist‐to‐hip ratio, and waist‐to‐height ratio""",Yes,"""There was an approximate log‐linear relationship between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of MI in both sexes. A 1‐SD higher in body mass index, waist circumference, waist‐to‐hip ratio, and waist‐to‐height ratio, respectively, were associated with hazard ratios (confidence intervals) for MI of 1.22 (1.17; 1.28), 1.35 (1.28; 1.42), 1.49 (1.39; 1.59), and 1.34 (1.27; 1.40) in women and of 1.28 (1.23; 1.32), 1.28 (1.23; 1.33), 1.36 (1.30; 1.43), and 1.33 (1.28; 1.38) in men. The corresponding women‐to‐men ratios of hazard ratios were 0.96 (0.91; 1.02), 1.07 (1.00; 1.14), 1.15 (1.06; 1.24), and 1.03 (0.97; 1.09).  Conclusions Although general and central adiposity measures each have profound deleterious effects on the risk of MI in both sexes, a higher waist circumference and waist‐to‐hip ratio conferred a greater excess risk of MI in women than in men. Waist‐to‐hip ratio was more strongly associated with the risk of MI than body mass index in both sexes, especially in women.""",Yes,"!Excess adipose tissue is a major, and increasingly common, risk factor for chronic diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI), the leading cause of death worldwide.1, 2 In 2016, the World Health Organization estimated that more than 40% of women and 39% of men worldwide were overweight (defined as a body mass index [BMI] of >25 kg/m2) and that over 15% of women and 11% of men were obese (BMI >30 kg/m2).3  BMI is the most widely used measure to assess the prevalence of overweight and obesity across populations and to quantify the detrimental effects of excess adipose tissue on the risk of MI in later life. However, BMI is a measure of general adiposity and does not discriminate between adipose tissue present in visceral and subcutaneous areas. Yet, as compared with subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue is more metabolically active, is closely related to insulin resistance, and may be more strongly associated with cardiometabolic risk.4, 5 Measures of central adiposity and body composition, including waist circumference, waist‐to‐hip ratio, and waist‐to‐height ratio, may, therefore, be better suited than BMI for quantifying the etiological relationship between adiposity and cardiovascular disease. Although some studies have reported that measures of central adiposity are more strongly related to cardiovascular risk than BMI,6, 7, 8, 9, 10 others have found minimal differences across anthropometric measures and reported that each measure was similarly associated with the risk of future MI.11, 12  There are substantial sex differences in body fat distribution, with a predominance of subcutaneous fat in women and visceral fat in men.13, 14 Although the association between BMI and the risk of MI is broadly similar between women and men,15 it is conceivable that there is a sex differential in the effects of central adiposity on the risk of MI—with potentially stronger effects in women than men. However, most previous studies did not report the associations between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of MI separately for women and men.

Up to 600 million people are affected worldwide and COPD is one of the leading causes of mortality.1 COPD is characterized by progressive and largely irreversible airflow limitation resulting in dyspnea. Extrapulmonary features such as fatigue, osteoporosis, cardiac failure, and depression are highly prevalent.2  Patients with COPD can have cognitive impairments, either globally or in single cognitive domains.3 Reported incidence ranges from 12% to 88%.4 Cognitive impairment may be associated with the degree of lung function impairment in patients with COPD5 and has been found to predict mortality in hypoxemic COPD.6 Moreover, cognitive impairment may lead to increased dyspnea and fatigue7 and result in incorrect use of inhaler devices and low compliance with medical treatment as has previously been shown in elderly subjects.8 This might increase the exacerbation risk and could result in worse health outcome.9 To date it remains unknown which domains of cognitive functioning are affected in community-based patients with COPD.10  Insight in cognitive functioning is of great importance to optimize self-management programs for patients with COPD. Indeed, for a patient with COPD, it is important to comply with guidelines for a healthier life style (eg, quit smoking, correct use of medication, and become physically active). Executive functions are evoked for adequate self-management.11 The domain executive functioning is a multifaceted neuropsychological construct, consisting of a set of higher-order neurocognitive processes that contribute to purposeful, goal-directed, and future-oriented behavioral skills, such as organization, planning, problem solving, and reasoning.12 Patients with executive function deficits have difficulties in managing their disease.11 Consequently, cognitive impairments in COPD patients may negatively affect their treatment and in particular the impact of self-management programs.""",Yes,"""To date it remains unknown which domains of cognitive functioning are affected in community-based patients with COPD.10...The aims of the present study were to compare different domains of cognitive functioning between persons in the general population with and without obstructive lung disease (OLD) and to analyze the relationship between cognitive functioning and the degree of airflow limitation.""",Yes,"""The aims of the present study were to compare different domains of cognitive functioning between persons in the general population with and without obstructive lung disease (OLD) and to analyze the relationship between cognitive functioning and the degree of airflow limitation.

First, the classification OLD was based on the fixed ratio of FEV1/FVC. We were unable to distinguish between asthma, bronchiectasis, bronchitis, and COPD. Comorbidities like blood clot, deep vein thrombosis, bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, and rhinitis were grouped in the database, and, therefore, we were unable to split comorbidities within 1 group for further analysis. Furthermore, persons with severe COPD seem to be underrepresented in this study. However, the distribution of airflow limitation in this study is representative of the distribution of COPD in the general population.24, 25 Second, all used cognitive tests concerned visual spatial information, which is unelaborated. More detailed neuropsychological assessment is needed to explore other domains of cognitive functioning in OLD and to control for differences such as motor skills or visual difficulties. Nevertheless, previous studies often only used 1 scale to measure global cognitive functioning (eg, the Mini-Mental State Examination),9, 26 while the current study used a concise testing battery to measure 5 domain-specific cognitive skills. Next to cognitive functioning, other aspects of executive functioning should be investigated in future studies to get a better insight in the role of executive functioning in respiratory diseases. Third, no data were available regarding impact of cognitive impairment in various domains on clinically relevant outcomes (eg, health-related quality of life, exacerbations, and mortality). Also, data on other possible confounders, such as hypoxemia, long-term oxygen therapy,27, 28 obstructive sleep apnea, and overlap syndrome,29 which may affect cognitive functioning, are lacking. Finally, we adjusted for symptoms of depression assessed by a single touchscreen question instead of the presence of a major depression disorder diagnosed by a clinician.""",No,,Yes,"""The present population-based study shows that persons with OLD may experience cognitive impairment in different domains, which could be related to impaired lung function. Therefore, cognitive impairment should be considered as an important extrapulmonary manifestation of COPD. In particular, the domains memory and information processing are affected, which can have important consequences for self-management skills. Further assessment of domains of cognitive functioning and the relationship between cognitive impairment and patient-related outcomes is needed to optimize patient-oriented treatment and self-management programs for patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Future studies should also assess the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation and lifestyle factors on the relationship between lung function and cognitive functioning in patients with COPD. Hereby it is important to take premorbid ability and longitudinal change in cognitive functioning in persons with OLD into account to explore a potentially causal relationship.""",Partially,"In relation to one disease ""furthermore, persons with severe COPD seem to be underrepresented in this study.

We found consistent evidence that remaining in school causally reduced risk of diabetes and mortality in all specifications.  We do not know if the differences in outcomes across education groups is because education directly causes these outcomes, by affecting behaviors, such as smoking, or if these differences are due to other factors, such as socioeconomic or genomic differences. Whether education causes differences in outcomes later in life has been the subject of considerable debate by epidemiologists, economists and other social scientists.1–3,7–17 Economists have argued that in addition to its effects on income, a substantial portion of the benefits of education accrue via its potential effects on mortality and morbidity.3 Epidemiologists have found that people who attended university have higher fluid intelligence in adulthood.18 These associations are robust to adjustment for parental social class and adolescent cognition, which has been taken by some as proof that education causes later outcomes.19 Despite this, many epidemiologists and economists are acutely aware that correlations and multivariable adjusted regressions can be unreliable evidence of causation.20–22 The ideal experiment to test this hypothesis, randomizing the age at which children leave school, is unlikely to be ethical, cost-effective, or timely. A more feasible, and potentially robust, research design is to exploit natural experiments that affected when people left school but are not related to confounding factors.23,24 One widely used natural experiment are changes to the legal minimum school leaving age. These changes forced some people to stay in school for longer than they would have otherwise chosen.  In September 1972, the school leaving age increased from age 15 to 16 for children in England. Before the reform, the vast majority of those who left school at age 15 went into the labor force and found employment. The 1971 census indicated that in April 1971 32% of 15-year olds were non-students, of whom 87% were in the labor force. At this time, the unemployment rates in this group were 21.7% and 14.9% for males and females respectively.25 Government discussions at the time of the reform raised concerns at the impact of the immediate withdrawal of 400,000 15-year olds from the labor force as a result of the reform. School leavers at this time were strongly attached to the labor market.26 Researchers have previously used this policy change to investigate the effects of forcing students to stay in school longer using administrative data and longitudinal cohort studies.2,4,27,28 However, the cohort studies had relatively small samples and, as a result, produced relatively imprecise estimates of the effects of education. Previous results from administrative data lacked detailed information needed to identify people born in England affected by the reform, or on many outcomes of interest such as cognition or clinical measures of aging such as grip strength.""",Yes,"""In the current study, we used the raising of the school leaving age in 1972 as a natural experiment to estimate the causal effects of schooling.

It may be that laser surgery has been under-reported but, by the same token, the mean spherical equivalent distribution in those who do not report surgery appears to be appropriate for this age group of population; therefore, if there is some under-report of surgery, it seems unlikely to have influenced the observed results.""",NA,Used all eligible participants,Yes,"Table 1 ""Study Population Non-cycloplegic autorefraction was carried out with the use of the Tomey RC 5000 autorefkeratometer (Tomey Corp).

Frequency of Laser Surgery, Overall and by Age, by Sociodemographic Factors Overall, of those with refractive error eligible for laser refractive surgery 3.1% (3.0 to 3.3) reported bilateral and 0.9% (0.8 to 1.0) unilateral treatment: 4.4% (4.1 to 4.6) in women and 3.7% (3.4 to 3.9) in men. There was a decreasing trend in frequency with age, from 8.6% (7.8 to 9.5) in the younger age group (40 to 44 years) to 2.5% (2.3 to 2.8) in the oldest age group (65 to 69 years) (Table 3). Laser surgery was also more common among those in higher categories of accommodation tenure and with higher educational attainment. There was an increasing trend in frequency of surgery with increasing income in those of pre-retirement age (ie, 40 to 60 years). Among the employed, frequency decreased with age: 7.7% (7.1 to 8.3) (40 to 49 years), 4.2% (3.9 to 4.5) (50 to 59 years), and 2.6 (2.3 to 3.0) (60 to 69 years).  Distribution of Refractive Surgery by Sociodemographic Factors The distributions of age, sex, ethnicity, and socio-economic factors differed between those who had bilateral surgery and those who had refractive error and would have been eligible for refractive surgery but did not report it (Table 4). There were no such differences observed when comparing with the unilateral surgery group.A higher proportion of participants who had refractive surgery were women (60.4% vs 55.9%), were younger (49% vs 26%, age 40 to 54 years), with higher income (34% vs 26% in the range >52k), and of minority ethnicity (89.2% vs 91.6% white) (Table 4). There was some indication that those having surgery were less likely to be in the lowest or highest category of educational qualification or accommodation tenure.  Frequency of Other Self-Reported Ocular Conditions Of note, the frequency of other self-reported eye conditions was higher in the group reporting laser refractive surgery (27.5%) than in those with refractive error but no surgery (11.4%) and those without refractive error (8.1%) (Table 5). Specifically, cataract was reported by 8.9%, ocular trauma by 1.7%, retinal detachment by 2.1%, diabetic eye disease by 3.3%, and glaucoma by 2.5% of those who reported having laser refractive surgery. Because these were cross-sectional data, it was not possible to determine whether these additional ocular disorders occurred before or after refractive surgery.Distribution and Frequency of General Health and Happiness and Social Activity Outcomes There were no consistent differences found in report of general health, happiness, or visits from/to friends between the 2 groups in either distribution or frequency of laser eye surgery (Table 3, Table 6). There were significant differences in the distribution of those reporting social and physical activities.

Such models can be used in a variety of settings for prevention, screening, and guiding investigations and treatments. Models aimed at predicting future disease risk that contains lifestyle factors may be of particular use for targeting health promotion activities at an individual level. This type of cancer risk prediction is not yet available in the UK. We have adopted the approach used by the well-established U.S.-derived ""YourCancerRisk"" model for use in the UK population, which allow users to quantify their individual risk of developing individual cancers relative to the population average risk. The UK version of “YourCancerRisk"" computes 10-year cancer risk estimates for 11 cancers utilizing UK figures for prevalence of risk factors and cancer incidence. Because the prevalence of risk factors and the incidence rates for cancer are different between the U.S. and the UK population, this UK model provides more accurate estimates of risks for a UK population.

The model can be used to estimate absolute and relative cancer risk for use in Primary Care and community settings""",Yes,"""Introduction Over recent years, there has been a growth in the development of risk prediction models for cancer and other diseases (1–6). These models provide a range of estimates of future risk of developing disease for applications in prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Most of them are disease specific. In general, risk algorithms include phenotypic information such as sex, age, and lifestyle factors. Some algorithms may also allow for the incorporation of emerging “omics”-based factors and other biomarkers (7).  Few cancer risk prediction models have included the modifiable risk components such as physical activity, diet, and smoking. One such model that has been developed for the United States is the ""YourCancerRisk"" model which has been used as a tool for education as well as providing an approach to quantifying the effects of changing key lifestyle exposures. This was subsequently expanded into ""YourDiseaseRisk"" (8), which extends the range of endpoints to include 12 of the commonest types of cancers in the United States and 6 other chronic diseases (e.g., chronic bronchitis, stroke, emphysema, heart disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis). The model was validated for ovarian, colon, and pancreatic cancers in the United States in Nurses’ Health Study and the U.S. Health Professionals cohorts. The results show the model to be well calibrated for ovarian and colon cancer in women and pancreatic cancer in men and moderately calibrated for colon cancer in men. Discriminatory accuracy for pancreatic cancer showed a concordance index of 0.72, and for colon cancer in men and women, concordance indices were 0.71 and 0.67, respectively (9).  The “YourDiseaseRisk” model aims to predict the risks for individuals (aged 40 and above) of developing the 12 cancers relative to the general population. Uniquely, the approach adopted to develop such models involved extensive systematic reviews of existing studies and finding a consensus of expert opinions to identify risk factors and to the summarize the level of evidence as “definite,” “probable,” and “possible” causes of cancer. Risk points were then allocated according to the strength of the causal association and summed. Population average risk of cancer and cumulative 10-year risk were obtained from the U.S. SEER data (10). Finally, individual ranking relative to the population average was determined.  The “YourDiseaseRisk” online tool has been available in the United States since 2000. It is offered as an educational tool, and in 2005, the site recorded 54 million hits with 6.2 million page views. It was first hosted at Harvard University and, in 2007, transitioned to the Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine (CITE Siteman/Wash U/BJH only; ref. 8).""",No,,Yes,"""The focus of this article is to describe the steps taken to adapt the ""YourDiseaseRisk"" models focused on cancers for the UK population for use in Primary Care and community-based settings.

The UKBiobank female cohort consists of 273,467 women with age ranged between 40 and 69 years when recruited. Participants were enrolled in the UK Biobank from April 2007 to July 2010, from 21 assessment centers across England, Wales, and Scotland using standardized procedures (11). The UK Biobank study was approved by the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided written informed consent to participate in the UK Biobank study. To date, the cohort has been followed up for 6 years. We computed RRs adjusted only for age. The results are presented in Table 6.  Model validation: An example To demonstrate model validation, we selected breast cancer risk prediction as an example. The UKBiobank cohort was used for the validation exercise. For breast cancer cases, we used ICD10, ICD9, and self-reported codes (verified by the UKBiobank health professionals), and only incident cases were included in the analysis. For controls, we used two comparison groups. Firstly only those subjects with no cancer code recorded in ICD10, ICD9 and secondly the coded with no cancer and no other self-reported illness. The total number of incident breast cancer cases was 3,378, and the total number of noncancer controls was 235,603 or healthy controls was 59,731. We coded all variables (except Tamoxifen/Raloxifene usage as such data were not available) present in the breast cancer risk prediction model based on the presence or absence of the exposure for each individual as illustrated in Table 3. To demonstrate model validation, we calculated the area under the curve of the model based on including all factors scored as a binary variable and generated calibration plots -the observed and expected proportions compare within the groups formed by the Hosmer–Lemeshow test. All analyses were performed using STATA 14 (12)...Once information on the UK prevalence of each risk factor was obtained, we then applied a score to each risk factor using the same scheme as presented in the original article (summary as shown in Table 3).  This risk score is used to compute two further scores—the population average risk score and an individual risk score relative to the population average. The population average score is calculated by multiplying the risk score of each factor by the population prevalence of that particular factor. To prevent negative scores, we chose the direction of each risk factor to make the population average score the highest possible. Taking physical activity, for example, the prevalence of carrying out 3 or more hours of total leisure-time physical activity per week in the UK population is 23%. This figure means that 77% of the population do not do physical activity regularly at this particular level. When we apply a prevalence of 77%, then the assigned score instead of being –10 (for those who are doing regular exercise) will be +10. This conversion allows us to demonstrate the change in the individual risk score following any change in factors that are modifiable. Summation of these scores produces the average population score.  The risk score for a given individual relative to the population average is based on the presence or absence of each factor. An example is illustrated in Table 4. The summation of scores for each risk factor for an individual provides the total risk score for a particular person. That total risk score is then divided by the average population score to give an individual index that is relative to population score (35/27= 1.3). As mentioned earlier, participants can see how their risk changes if they adopt suggested behaviors, for example, by choosing to do regular exercise, the total score for the individual illustrated in Table 4 can be reduced by 10 points (from 35 to 25), making their index score relative to the population reduced from 1.3 to 0.8. This calculation aims to illustrate to each individual the effect of a particular lifestyle or behavior change leading to cancer risk reduction.""",NA,Not used,NA,Not used,No,,No,,,,,,NA,Not used,Partially,"Missing potentially eligible ""The UKBiobank female cohort consists of 273,467 women...The total number of incident breast cancer cases was 3,378, and the total number of noncancer controls was 235,603 or healthy controls was 59,731.

The aim of the study was to compare the performance of different muscle mass measures for predicting incident osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.  Methods This study included data from 149 166 participants (aged 60.3 ± 5.5 years) as part of the UK Biobank cohort. Body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance. The muscle mass measures included were total body skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and appendicular SMM (aSMM) divided by height squared (ht2), derived residuals, SMM, SMM adjusted for body mass (SMM/bm × 100), and aSMM normalized for body mass index (aSMM/BMI).

SMM/ht2, aSMM/ht2 residual, and SMM were lower in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis compared with women without (all P < 0.0001), while SMM/bm × 100 (P = 0.003), but not aSMM/BMI (P = 0.59), was higher in the osteoporosis group. The unadjusted rates of osteoporosis increased with decreasing quintiles for SMM/ht2, aSMM/ht2, residuals, and SMM (all P trend <0.0001), while the incidence of osteoporosis increased with increasing SMM/bm × 100 (P trend =0.001), but not for aSMM/BMI (P = 0.45). After minimally adjusting for age and after full adjustment, SMM/ht2, aSMM/ht2, and SMM were the only measure that consistently predicted osteoporosis in the total group of postmenopausal women [hazard ratio (HR) 0.65–0.67, all P ≤ 0.0001], in lean women (HR 0.62–0.68; all P ≤ 0.001), and women with increased adiposity (HR 0.64–0.68; all P ≤ 0.01). In fully adjusted models, the changes in the R 2 statistic were 13.4%, 11.6%, and 15.3% for the SMM/ht2 (aSMM/ht2), residual, and SMM, but only 4.9% and 1.3% for SMM/bm × 100 and aSMM/BMI.Conclusions Muscle mass measures adjusted for height only (SMM/ht2, aSMM/ht2) appear to be better muscle‐relevant risk factors for incident osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, including when stratified into lean participants and participants with increased adiposity.""  ",Yes,"""Introduction Menopause is accompanied by pronounced changes in body composition including loss of bone (osteoporosis) and muscle (sarcopenia), often in the presence of increased adiposity and fat redistribution towards central‐type obesity.1, 2, 3 Osteoporosis, a skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, predisposes to skeletal fragility and increases fracture risk.2 It is typically diagnosed on the basis of a bone mineral density (BMD) T‐score ≤ −2.5, as assessed by dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA).2 Because of its association with fractures, osteoporosis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and results in substantial burden for both individuals and healthcare systems.4 Current estimates suggest that approximately 50% of women over 50 years old are at risk of osteoporotic fractures.5 In contrast to osteoporosis, sarcopenia remains poorly defined, with lack of consensus about its operational definition.6 Nevertheless, it is especially common in postmenopausal women, with prevalence reaching up to 30% depending on the definition and population used.3 Thus far, proposed definitions are based on muscle mass alone7, 8, 9 or combined with muscle function (e.g. grip strength) and/or physical performance (e.g. gait speed).10, 11, 12, 13 Further perplexing the current debate, a number of muscle mass measures and different threshold for these measures have been suggested. These include total body or appendicular muscle mass adjusted for height only,7, 8, 11 height and fat mass,9 or body size [i.e. body mass index (BMI)13 or body mass12]. Despite the plethora of muscle mass measures, there is scarcity of data on their association with health outcomes. Some previous studies that explored the relationship between osteoporosis and sarcopenia have yielded mixed results.14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Studies are limited by small sample size,14, 15, 17, 18 or cross‐sectional design,14, 15, 16, 17, 18 making extrapolation to the general population challenging.

Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) was calculated using the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) equation published previously by Janssen and colleagues22:  SMM(kg)=[(ht2/R×0.401)+(gender×3.825)+(age×−0.071)]+5.102, where ht2 = height in centimetres squared; R = resistance in ohms; for gender, men = 1 and women = 0; and age is in years.  Appendicular SMM (aSMM), representing the sum of SMM in arms and legs, was calculated using the equation provided by Wang et al.23: aSMM = SMM/1.33.  Muscle mass measures For the purpose of the present analysis, we included five muscle mass measures previously used in sarcopenia definitions.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Unadjusted SMM was also considered for comparisons. Specifically, SMM and aSMM were divided by height squared (SMM/ht2 and aSMM/ht2).7, 8, 10, 11 Based on the definition proposed by Delmonico et al.9 and previously published methods,24 the relationship between appendicular fat‐free mass on height (m) and fat mass (kg) was modelled using linear regression analysis and the standardized residuals of the regression were computed. Muscle mass was also adjusted for body size; aSMM was divided by BMI (aSMM/BMI),13 and SMM was divided by body mass and multiplied by 100 (SMM/bm × 100).12, 25  Assessment of outcome Via the Health and Social Care Information Centre for English and Welsh participants and the Information Services Department for Scottish participants, we ascertained the diagnosis of osteoporosis with or without a pathological fracture until 31 January 2016 for England and Wales and 30 November 2015 for Scotland.

These include total body or appendicular muscle mass adjusted for height only,7, 8, 11 height and fat mass,9 or body size [i.e. body mass index (BMI)13 or body mass12]. Despite the plethora of muscle mass measures, there is scarcity of data on their association with health outcomes.

Participants self‐reported their age, sex, and ethnicity. Ethnicity was categorized as White or other (mixed, Asian, Black, Chinese, and other). A Townsend deprivation score was computed for all participants using information about employment, car and home ownership, and household overcrowding.20 A higher Townsend deprivation score is indicative of greater levels of an area's socio‐economic deprivation.20 Participants reported their smoking status (never, previous, or current) and their alcohol intake (never, previous, or current). Data on physical activity including frequency (number of days in a typical week that participants performed 10 min or more of walking, moderate, and vigorous physical activity) and duration (minutes spent on each activity category on a typical day) were collected by asking questions similar to those included in the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.21 For each activity category, the frequency was multiplied by the duration and the metabolic equivalent value (3.3 for walking, 4.0 for moderate physical activity, and 8.0 for vigorous physical activity), which were then summed to generate a score of metabolic equivalent minutes of physical activity per week for each participant.  Medical history and current medications Self‐reported data on medical conditions were collected at baseline by asking participants whether a doctor has diagnosed any cancer or diabetes. Participants reported if they had undergone bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy or were on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Self‐reported data on fracture occurrence (yes or no) over the past 5 years were also collected. Information on X‐ray verification was unavailable.  Quantitative heel ultrasound Quantitative ultrasound of the heel was performed using the Sahara Clinical Sonometer (Hologic, Bedford, Massachusetts) according to a standardized protocol. Trained staff checked if participants were able to undertake both left and right heel ultrasound measurement. Those with open wounds, breaks or sores around the heel, or metal parts (such as pins) in the heel did not undertake measurement of that heel. Each centre used the same machine model, and quality control was performed with a phantom on a daily basis as per manufacturer's instructions. The mean values for BMDs (g/cm2) and BMD T‐scores for the left and right heel were computed.  Anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance measurements Height was measured using the SECA 240 height measure (SECA, Hamburg, Germany). Participants removed their socks and footwear and stood flat footed with their heels against a back plate. Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a segmental body composition analyser (Tanita BC‐418MA, Tokyo, Japan). Height and weight were used to calculate BMI as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). Waist circumference was measured at the level of the umbilicus using a tape measure.

The establishment of the UK Biobank provided a unique opportunity to investigate this relationship.  Patients and methods We studied a sample of UK Biobank participants of White ethnicity aged 40–69 years old who underwent autorefraction (N=91 592) and were classified as myopic (≤−0.75 Dioptres (D)), highly myopic (≤−6.00 D), or non-myopic (>−0.75 D). Self-reported age at diagnosis of past medical conditions was ascertained during an interview with a nurse at a Biobank assessment centre. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for myopia or high myopia associated with a diagnosis before age 17 years of each of nine febrile illnesses, after adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, highest educational qualification, and birth order).""",Yes,"""Results Rubella, mumps, and pertussis were associated with myopia: rubella, OR=1.38, 95% CI: 1.03–1.85, P=0.030; mumps, OR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.07–1.64, P=0.010; and pertussis, OR=1.39, 95% CI 1.03–1.87, P=0.029. Measles, rubella, and pertussis were associated with high myopia: measles, OR=1.48, 95% CI: 1.07–2.07, P=0.019; rubella, OR=1.94, 95% CI: 1.12–3.35, P=0.017; and pertussis, OR=2.15, 95% CI: 1.24–3.71, P=0.006. The evidence did not support an interaction between education and febrile illness in explaining the above risks.

Combinations of traditional factors such as smoking and alcohol are well described, but the additional effects of emerging factors such as television viewing time are not. The effect of socioeconomic deprivation on these extended lifestyle risks also remains unclear. We aimed to examine whether deprivation modifies the association between an extended score of lifestyle-related risk factors and health outcomes. Methods Data for this prospective analysis were sourced from the UK Biobank, a prospective population-based cohort study. We assigned all participants an extended lifestyle score, with 1 point for each unhealthy lifestyle factor (incorporating sleep duration and high television viewing time, in addition to smoking, excessive alcohol, poor diet [low intake of oily fish or fruits and vegetables, and high intake of red meat or processed meats], and low physical activity), categorised as most healthy (score 0–2), moderately healthy (score 3–5), or least healthy (score 6–9). Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between lifestyle score and health outcomes (all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality and incidence), and whether this association was modified by deprivation. All analyses were landmark analyses, in which participants were excluded if they had an event (death or cardiovascular disease event) within 2 years of recruitment. Participants with non-communicable diseases (except hypertension) and missing covariate data were excluded from analyses. Participants were also excluded if they reported implausible values for physical activity, sleep duration, and total screen time. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, month of assessment, history of hypertension, systolic blood pressure, medication for hypercholesterolaemia or hypertension, and body-mass index categories.""",Yes,"""Findings 328 594 participants aged 40–69 years were included in the study, with a mean follow-up period of 4·9 years (SD 0·83) after the landmark period for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, and 4·1 years (0·81) for cardiovascular disease incidence. In the least deprived quintile, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) in the least healthy lifestyle category, compared with the most healthy category, was 1·65 (95% CI 1·25–2·19) for all-cause mortality, 1·93 (1·16–3·20) for cardiovascular disease mortality, and 1·29 (1·10–1·52) for cardiovascular disease incidence. Equivalent HRs in the most deprived quintile were 2·47 (95% CI 2·04–3·00), 3·36 (2·36–4·76), and 1·41 (1·25–1·60), respectively. The HR for trend for one increment change towards least healthy in the least deprived quintile compared with that in the most deprived quintile was 1·25 (95% CI 1·12–1·39) versus 1·55 (1·40–1·70) for all-cause mortality, 1·30 (1·05–1·61) versus 1·83 (1·54–2·18) for cardiovascular disease mortality, and 1·10 (1·04–1·17) versus 1·16 (1·09–1·23) for cardiovascular disease incidence. A significant interaction was found between lifestyle and deprivation for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality (both pinteraction<0·0001), but not for cardiovascular disease incidence (pinteraction=0·11). Interpretation Wide combinations of lifestyle factors are associated with disproportionate harm in deprived populations. Social and fiscal policies that reduce poverty are needed alongside public health and individual-level interventions that address a wider range of lifestyle factors in areas of deprivation.""",Yes,"""Introduction Non-communicable diseases are the commonest cause of death worldwide, and these diseases are mainly caused by unhealthy lifestyles.1 The contribution of socioeconomic deprivation to mortality risk is similar to that observed for some lifestyle factors (eg, physical inactivity).2 However, the relationships between lifestyle factors, deprivation, and mortality remain unclear. For example, although deprived populations have the highest prevalence of multiple co-occurring adverse lifestyle factors and the highest premature mortality,2,  3 the prevalence of lifestyle factors only partially explains the increased mortality associated with deprivation.4 Study of the synergistic interaction between lifestyle factors and deprivation might improve our understanding of the excess mortality associated with deprivation. For example, individuals from deprived groups have an increased risk of harm from the same amount of alcohol consumed even after controlling for drinking patterns, body-mass index, and smoking.5 Similarly, deprived populations are disproportionately affected by the harmful effects of smoking and physical inactivity.6,  7 Mechanisms underlying this disproportionate lifestyle harm remain unclear but might include extremes of unhealthy lifestyle factors,8 interactions with other factors associated with deprivation (such as psychosocial stress),9 and reduced access to health services.10 However, previous studies of interactions between lifestyle factors and deprivation have examined only smoking, alcohol intake, and physical inactivity.5,  6,  7 Numerous individual lifestyle factors are associated with mortality; however, combinations of lifestyle factors interact synergistically, resulting in stronger associations with mortality.11 Evidence from the past 3 years has emphasised a role for emerging factors, such as sleep duration and television viewing time.12,  13 Combining emerging and traditional factors (smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, and diet) in extended lifestyle scores shows that a high proportion of deaths are due to modifiable factors and are therefore avoidable, highlighting new targets for public health intervention.14 To our knowledge, interactions between deprivation and extended combinations of lifestyle factors that include emerging factors have not been investigated. An understanding of how health outcomes associated with a broad combination of lifestyle factors vary with deprivation could inform future public health policy, highlighting new targets for individual-level and population-level interventions.""",Yes,"""To our knowledge, interactions between deprivation and extended combinations of lifestyle factors that include emerging factors have not been investigated.

Lifestyle variables comprising the score were derived from questionnaire responses (appendix). If available, we used national guidelines to generate healthy and unhealthy categories for each lifestyle factor. We assigned 1 point to participants for each unhealthy category (current smoker; alcohol consumed daily or almost daily; <150 min per week of moderate intensity physical activity or <75 min per week of vigorous intensity physical activity; ≥4 h per day of television viewing time; <7 h or >9 h of sleep per day; <400 g of fruits and vegetables per day; less than one portion of oily fish per week; more than three portions of red meat per week; more than one portion of processed meat per week). Participants' points were summed to create an unweighted score. The minimum score was 0, indicating a healthier lifestyle, and the maximum score was 9, indicating an unhealthier lifestyle.

Townsend deprivation index scores were derived from national census data about car ownership, household overcrowding, owner occupation, and unemployment aggregated for postcodes of residence.17 Higher Townsend scores equate to higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation. Data about household income were self-reported (appendix). Educational attainment was derived from the highest self-reported qualification based on the International Standard Classification of Education (appendix).18 Age was calculated from dates of birth and baseline assessment. Ethnicity was self-reported as white, mixed, Asian or Asian British, black or black British, Chinese, or other ethnic group; data for ethnic subgroups were available, but with few participants in each, we did not analyse participants by ethnic subgroup. Smoking status was categorised into never, former, and current smoking. Non-communicable diseases (depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, alcohol problems, substance abuse, eating disorders, cognitive impartment, dementia, Parkinson's disease, chronic pain syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic asthma, chronic liver diseases, hypertension, heart diseases, stroke, diabetes, inflammatory diseases, arthritis, and cancer) were self-reported on the baseline questionnaire. Trained nurses measured blood pressure, height, and bodyweight during the initial assessment. WHO criteria were applied to classify body-mass index into underweight (<18·5 kg/m2), normal weight (18·5–24·9 kg/m2), overweight (25·0–29·9 kg/m2), and obese (≥30·0 kg/m2).19 Available data for lifestyle factors in UK Biobank were used to generate a lifestyle score using smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, television viewing time, sleep duration, fruit and vegetable intake, oily fish intake, and red and processed meat intake. This score was based on a previously published score from an Australian cohort of 267 079 adults, which represented the sum of each dichotomised lifestyle variable (0 points if not at risk, 1 point if at risk), resulting in a risk score range of 0–6, in which a higher score indicated higher risk (appendix).14 UK Biobank data collection precluded using exactly the same lifestyle variables so the score was adapted. Lifestyle variables comprising the score were derived from questionnaire responses (appendix). If available, we used national guidelines to generate healthy and unhealthy categories for each lifestyle factor.

We found that the association between an unhealthy lifestyle and all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality becomes stronger with increasing levels of deprivation. This disproportionate lifestyle-associated risk in more deprived groups was seen with both area-level and individual-level measures of socioeconomic status. Furthermore, this risk was even greater in more deprived groups when lifestyle was measured by an extended score that included emerging factors than by a traditional score. These inequalities in lifestyle-related risk were not accounted for by differences in sex, age, ethnicity, blood pressure, concurrent cholesterol or blood pressure medication, or body-mass index. The steeper all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality trends (figure) across lifestyle categories in more deprived groups support a vulnerability hypothesis whereby deprived groups are more vulnerable to the effects of unhealthy lifestyles than are groups that are not deprived.6,  20 According to this hypothesis, deprived groups are likely to experience disproportionate harm from unhealthy lifestyles, which is not simply explained by greater prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles.""",Yes,"""Although there was a clear trend of increasing risk of cardiovascular disease incidence with least healthy lifestyle category and increasing deprivation, we found no significant interaction between lifestyle and deprivation for cardiovascular disease incidence. There were many more cardiovascular disease incidence events (17 380) than all-cause (5553) and cardiovascular disease (1528) mortality events, and therefore the estimates for cardiovascular disease incidence might be more accurate. However, cardiovascular disease mortality is a composite measure of both cardiovascular disease incidence and survival; because deprivation is associated with both of these outcomes, the modifying effect of deprivation might, as a result, be stronger for mortality than for incidence, which includes both fatal and non-fatal events. An alternative explanation for this non-significant interaction might lie in the socioeconomic status differential in health-care-seeking behaviour, which results in under-reporting of non-fatal cardiovascular disease events in more deprived groups, whereas fatal events are less likely to be under-reported because all deaths are recorded in the UK. Previous qualitative research has shown that individuals from more deprived areas tend not to present to health services in response to chest pain, sometimes because of a perception of health service overuse.26 Here, the number and proportion of events generally increased with deprivation for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality despite fewer participants in more deprived groups (table 3). Although a similar pattern was seen for cardiovascular disease incidence, with the proportion of events increasing with deprivation, the absolute number of events did not increase with deprivation. This could represent under-reporting of non-fatal cardiovascular disease events in more deprived groups. Therefore, the incidence of cardiovascular disease in more deprived groups recorded in our study might be lower than the true incidence, and the resulting association with lifestyle and deprivation might be attenuated. UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort with linked data for registered deaths and hospital admissions, offering a unique opportunity to explore risks associated with lifestyles and deprivation. The large size of the cohort allowed us to exclude individuals with self-reported non-communicable diseases at baseline as well as those who died within 2 years of recruitment while maintaining sufficient participant numbers and statistical power. These strategies reduce the chance that our results are due to reverse causality (ie, poor health leading to unhealthy lifestyles and adverse outcomes), although the possibility remains in this observational study. We undertook analyses using both area-level and individual-level measures of socioeconomic status, which increases the robustness of our results. Participants with missing covariate data (about 8%) were excluded, which might have influenced results, but excluded participants were broadly similar to those included (appendix). UK Biobank is acknowledged to have a low response rate (5%), with participants being more affluent and more likely to be from a white ethnic background than the UK population as a whole. Consequently, summary statistics such as prevalence cannot be generalised to the wider UK population; however, estimates of the strength of associations can be generalised.27 Presence of a non-communicable disease at baseline and therefore exclusion from the final survival models was based on self-report; therefore, misreporting might have biased results. However, misreporting might be less likely because diagnosis was based on a physician's diagnosis and was discussed at interview with a trained nurse. Self-reported lifestyle data are prone to healthy reporting bias,28 and there were much larger numbers of participants in the moderately healthy and most healthy lifestyle categories (table 1; appendix), consistent with a misreporting phenomenon. Misreporting might have affected the associations described here if there were systematic differences in misreporting between affluent and deprived groups. Although evidence for a socioeconomic gradient of healthy recall bias is scarce, there might be more misreporting of lifestyle behaviours generally among more deprived groups than among affluent groups.29 Increased misreporting of lifestyle behaviours in deprived groups would flatten the associations between lifestyle and health outcomes among the deprived group, suggesting that the associations identified here would be even stronger with more accurate reporting. The lifestyle score used assumes the same level of risk associated with each component lifestyle factor.14 However, HRs varied by individual factor (appendix). Applying weighting for the risk associated with each component could produce different results. Moreover, identification of specific high-risk permutations or combinations of lifestyle factors, although not practical here (768 possible permutations for the nine lifestyle factors examined in this study), could help to identify high-risk groups in future research.

If this association is causal, policies to improve a broad range of lifestyle factors among these groups could lead to substantial improvements in health outcomes. This improvement in health outcomes would not only come about because of the higher prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles in deprived areas than in affluent areas but also because those in deprived areas appear to be more vulnerable to the deleterious effects of unhealthy lifestyle factors, including emerging factors such as sleep duration and television viewing time, than those in affluent areas. However, improvement of specific lifestyle factors alone in areas of deprivation is unlikely to reduce health inequalities. On the basis of the increased vulnerability seen in this study, deprived populations would continue to have worse outcomes despite similar levels of unhealthy lifestyle factors seen in affluent populations. This finding clearly strengthens the arguments for government policies that tackle upstream determinants of ill-health and aim to reduce poverty, and for health policies that offer increased support in areas of deprivation.22,  23,  25 Public health and individual-level interventions should aim to improve wider combinations of lifestyle factors but need to recognise and address the social and environmental determinants of lifestyle to avoid increasing health inequalities.30 Further research is required to understand the mechanisms behind the interaction between lifestyle and deprivation, as well as to identify those combinations of unhealthy lifestyle factors that incur the greatest risk across socioeconomic groups.""",Yes,""" UK Biobank is acknowledged to have a low response rate (5%), with participants being more affluent and more likely to be from a white ethnic background than the UK population as a whole.

Time to complete all five cognitive tests was approximately 15 min. The tests were designed specifically for the UK Biobank to allow administration at scale without examiner supervision. The tasks show evidence of an underlying performance factor and good stability over time, with the exception of visual memory performance, which has a comparatively lower intraclass correlation coefficient [22].  The five tasks involved the following instructions: • Reasoning: This task assessed the ability to solve 13 verbal and numeric reasoning problems. Each problem had five possible response options. The dependent variable was the total number of correct answers given (range 0–13) within a 2-min period, with higher scores indicating better performance.  • Basic reaction time: This task was delivered in the style of the card game, ‘snap’, and requested participants to respond with a button press when they detected the appearance of a matching pair of symbols. The dependent variable was the mean response time in milliseconds across 12 matching-pair trials. RT values were log-transformed because of skewed distribution (ln x).  • Numeric short-term memory: In this task, a string of numbers was presented on the screen, which subsequently disappeared. Participants were then asked to enter the number string from memory, in the reverse order, through a keypad. The dependent variable was the maximum string length recalled correctly (range: 0–12), with higher scores indicating better performance. The test was discontinued after five successive incorrect responses at string length = 2.  • Visual memory: In this task, six card pairs of symbols were presented on-screen in a random pattern.

The dependent variable was the number of errors made during pairs matching (range 0–146), which was log-transformed because of skewed distribution and zero inflation (ln (x + 1)).  • Prospective memory: In this task, participants were asked to remember to perform a pre-planned instruction. Specifically, at the beginning of the test battery, they were presented with the following instruction: ‘At the end of the games we will show you four coloured symbols and ask you to touch the blue square.

Prevalence, demographic and comorbidity profiles of those with insomnia symptoms were consistent with those in previous epidemiological investigations [1]. Unadjusted analyses revealed that those with frequent insomnia symptoms displayed impairment across all cognitive tasks (except prospective memory); however, intermediate adjustment for demographic variables rendered these associations non-significant or reversed their direction. Full adjustment (model 4) for demographic, medical and sleep-related variables left those with frequent insomnia symptoms with a small but statistically significant advantage over those without insomnia for all cognitive measures (except numeric memory).

First, this was a cross-sectional study and therefore our findings cannot elucidate causality. Second, our cognitive dependent variables were created for brief completion on large numbers of participants and hence have not undergone formal validation. In partial mitigation, principal component analyses support an expected underlying performance (g) factor across tasks, and test-retest suggests good stability for most task-dependent variables [22]. Moreover, associations with variables in the expected direction (eg, with age and education), evidence of impairment in those with psychiatric disorder [24] and associations with several genetic variants [49] provide further support of task validity. However, tasks were brief and did not parametrically manipulate cognitive load, and the battery did not sample additional domains of cognition, potentially contributing to limited sensitivity for insomnia-related impairment. Third, our sleep trait predictor variables were limited by their low resolution, reflecting just single item self-report questions. For example, our sleep duration estimate included daytime naps and therefore we could not separate the contribution of night and daytime sleep, which may have affected group categorisation and, by extension, associations with our dependent variables of interest. We could not investigate subtypes of insomnia that may have unique relationships with cognitive impairment [16]. Specifically, we could not categorise participants into insomnia disorder because we lacked information on chronicity of sleep problems, quantitative criteria (eg, minutes for sleep-onset latency and wake-time during the night), attribution for daytime cognitive impairment or help-seeking. Greater precision around these factors and objective sleep data may have identified sub-groups of participants with cognitive impairment [12], [15], [18], [30], [50]. Our results therefore can only speak to frequent insomnia symptoms at the population level. Fourth, our sample age was restricted to those predominantly in the middle age. It may be that insomnia confers the greatest risk to cognitive impairment in elderly samples [23]. Fifth, while the UK Biobank represents a large and unique resource, the recruitment method and low response rate (5.5%) may have resulted in selection biases, potentially limiting generalisability to the broader UK population [51]. Sixth, sample size differed across statistical models owing to missing data for specific covariates of interest. However, we note that when analyses were restricted to complete data across all models, findings remain unchanged (see Supplementary Table 2). Finally, our analyses were based exclusively on Gaussian linear models, and we did not test whether nonlinear and/or non-Gaussian models would reveal more nuanced associations between our predictor and outcome variables.""",Partially,"""In our large UK sample, frequent insomnia symptoms were not independently associated with cognitive impairment.

UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort comprising 502,637 men and women aged 40 to 69 years at recruitment. Supplementation with calcium/vitamin D was self‐reported, and information on incident hospital admission (ICD‐10) for ischemic heart disease (IHD), myocardial infarction (MI), and subsequent death was obtained from linkage to national registers. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate longitudinal relationships between calcium/vitamin D supplementation and hospital admission for men/women, controlling for covariates. A total of 475,255 participants (median age 58 years, 55.8% women) had complete data on calcium/vitamin D supplementation. Of that number, 33,437 participants reported taking calcium supplements; 19,089 vitamin D; and 10,007 both.""",Yes,""" In crude and adjusted analyses, there were no associations between use of calcium supplements and risk of incident hospital admission with either IHD, or subsequent death. Thus, for example, in unadjusted models, the hazard ratio (HR) for admission with myocardial infarction was 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79–1.20, p = 0.79) among women taking calcium supplementation. Corresponding HR for men is 1.16 (95% CI 0.92–1.46, p = 0.22). After full adjustment, HR (95% CI) were 0.82 (0.62–1.07), p = 0.14 among women and 1.12 (0.85–1.48), p = 0.41 among men. Adjusted HR (95% CI) for admission with IHD were 1.05 (0.92–1.19), p = 0.50 among women and 0.97 (0.82–1.15), p = 0.77 among men. Results were similar for vitamin D and combination supplementation. There were no associations with death, and in women, further adjustment for hormone‐replacement therapy use did not alter the associations. In this very large prospective cohort, there was no evidence that use of calcium/vitamin D supplementation was associated with increased risk of hospital admission or death after ischemic cardiovascular events.""",Yes,"""Introduction Calcium supplementation given with or without vitamin D supplementation is widely used, particularly in the elderly, and has been shown to modestly reduce the risk of new fragility fracture,1 particularly in those older individuals in residential care.2 Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is given routinely as adjunctive therapy with anti‐osteoporosis medications, all of which are licensed to be taken in the context of calcium and vitamin D repletion.3 Calcium supplementation either alone or in combination with vitamin D was viewed as extremely safe, other than gastrointestinal side effects and a slightly increased risk of renal stones,4 until a publication in the BMJ by Bolland and colleagues in 2008. In this New Zealand‐based trial of calcium supplementation in older women, increased risk of myocardial infarction with calcium supplementation was demonstrated.5 Subsequent meta‐analyses and a reanalysis of the Women's Health Initiative trial by the same group again demonstrated modest associations between calcium, or calcium and vitamin D, supplementation and increased risk of myocardial infarction but not cardiovascular death.6, 7 In contrast, no statistically significant associations between calcium and vitamin D supplementation and cardiac outcomes were found in a similar meta‐analysis by Lewis and colleagues8 or by investigators studying the Women's Health Initiative.9-11 However, in the Lewis study, a subanalysis among the much smaller number of individuals randomized to calcium alone did suggest an increased risk of myocardial infarction with use of calcium supplements alone versus placebo. Observational cohort data have led to similarly conflicting findings,(12–18) particularly with regard to dietary calcium intake compared with supplement use. More recently, work has documented differences in the endothelial response to prevailing calcium concentration between healthy and uremic patients,(19–21) and novel Mendelian randomization approaches have indicated an association between lifelong genetically determined calcium concentrations and ischemic heart disease.22, 23 Given the high incidence of osteoporotic fracture,24 cardiovascular side effects of treatments used to improve bone health, such as calcium/vitamin D supplementation, could potentially have major implications for public health.25 Across the intervention and observational data, there is substantial heterogeneity among both exposure and outcome definitions, and there is a marked dearth of evidence pertaining to men.""",Yes,"""Across the intervention and observational data, there is substantial heterogeneity among both exposure and outcome definitions, and there is a marked dearth of evidence pertaining to men.

Participants reporting glaucoma were more likely to be older (mean 61.4 vs 56.7 years, P<0.001) and male (2.1% vs 1.4%, P=0.001). The rate of reported glaucoma was significantly higher in Black (3.28%, P<0.001) and Asian (2.14%, P=0.009) participants compared with White participants (1.62%, reference). Cases of reported glaucoma had a higher mean IOP (18 mm Hg both eyes, P<0.001), lower corneal hysteresis (9.96 right eye, 9.89 left eye, P<0.001), and lower visual acuity (0.09 logMAR right eye, 0.08 logMAR left eye, P<0.001) compared with those without (16 mm Hg both eyes, hysteresis 10.67 right eye, 10.63 left eye, 0.03 logMAR right eye, 0.02 logMAR left eye). The mean Townsend deprivation index was −0.72 for those reporting glaucoma and −0.95 for those without (P<0.001), indicating greater relative deprivation in those reporting glaucoma. Multivariable logistic regression showed that people in the lowest income group (<£18 000/year) were significantly more likely to report a diagnosis of glaucoma compared with any other income level (P<0.01). We observed increasing glaucoma risk across the full range of income categories, with highest risk among those of lowest income, and no evidence of a threshold effect.

The increase in life expectancy in the UK, together with increasing referral of early cases and suspects has seen 7–8% per year growth in demand for glaucoma service appointments at Moorfields Eye Hospital.4 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension in 2009 (NICE, 2009) led to significant increases in referral numbers across the NHS.5, 6  Epidemiological data form a core part of the evidence base for clinical decision-making, informing judgements about risk of disease according to age, sex, racial origin, systemic and ocular risk factors.

Among people of European origin, primary open-angle glaucoma accounts for around 70–85% of all cases of glaucoma, hence risk factors for POAG would be expected to predominate as determinants of disease in a UK population. Self-reported glaucoma cases were older and more likely to be male than those without the diagnosis. The rate of self-reported glaucoma increased nonlinearly with age. Black and Asian people were significantly more likely to report a diagnosis of glaucoma than White participants. Among our study participants, the overall self-reported glaucoma rate was 1.7% in people aged 40–69 years. This rate of disease appears lower than figures from population prevalence studies in European derived populations aged 40 years and older (2.08% Baltimore Whites, USA; 2.0% Melbourne, Australia; 2.9% Egna-Neumarkt, Italy), where participants were all examined for glaucoma7, 21, 22 It has been well established in population-based studies in industrialized nations that at least 50% of all glaucoma remains undiagnosed.10, 23, 24 One recent study in the US using NHANES data puts the proportion of undiagnosed disease at 78%.25 We therefore expect the rate of self-reported glaucoma in UK Biobank to be lower than published population surveys owing to undiagnosed disease.  One of the most striking finding of our study was that, among UK Biobank participants, those who report a diagnosis of glaucoma were more likely to have a lower income and be from a relatively less affluent background. Participants in the lowest income group (<£18 000/year) were significantly more likely to have self-reported glaucoma, compared with any other income category, after adjusting for age, sex, race, IOP, and visual acuity. The mean Townsend deprivation index was −0.72 for those reporting glaucoma and −0.95 for those without (P<0.001). This indicates that both groups are less deprived than the UK average (index=0, scores>0 indicate relative deprivation), but those reporting a diagnosis of glaucoma were less likely to be as affluent as those without disease. Furthermore, we observed a gradient toward higher rates of glaucoma with decreasing income across the socioeconomic spectrum. Among a cohort who are less deprived than the UK average, the findings of reduced affluence among those reporting disease than in those who do not, and of a trend toward increased rate of disease across the spectrum of income groups are both novel, and important for understanding the mechanisms which drive the previously reported association between socioeconomic deprivation and late presentation of glaucoma.""",Yes,"""Limitations of this study clearly include the use of self-reported disease status, which can result in misclassification error.

This study determined the interactions between diabetes and grip strength and their association with health outcomes.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We undertook a prospective, general population cohort study by using UK Biobank. Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the associations between both grip strength and diabetes and the outcomes of all-cause mortality and CVD incidence/mortality as well as to test for interactions between diabetes and grip strength.""",Yes,"""RESULTS A total of 347,130 UK Biobank participants with full data available (mean age 55.9 years, BMI 27.2 kg/m2, 54.2% women) were included in the analysis, of which 13,373 (4.0%) had diabetes. Over a median follow-up of 4.9 years (range 3.3–7.8 years), 6,209 died (594 as a result of CVD), and 4,301 developed CVD. Participants with diabetes were at higher risk of all-cause and CVD mortality and CVD incidence. Significant interactions (P < 0.05) existed whereby the risk of CVD mortality was higher in participants with diabetes with low (hazard ratio [HR] 4.05 [95% CI 2.72, 5.80]) versus high (HR 1.46 [0.87, 2.46]) grip strength. Similar results were observed for all-cause mortality and CVD incidence.  CONCLUSIONS Risk of adverse health outcomes among people with diabetes is lower in those with high grip strength. Low grip strength may be useful to identify a higher-risk subgroup of patients with diabetes. Intervention studies are required to determine whether resistance exercise can reduce risk.""",Yes,"""Low muscle function, measured by grip strength, is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (1). Even during healthy aging, muscle function and mass decrease from ∼40–45 years of age, with the mechanisms underlying this observation currently unknown (2). This loss of muscle mass and function appears to be accelerated in people with type 2 diabetes. A cross-sectional analysis of data from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (485 adults 70–79 years of age with type 2 diabetes and 2,133 without) showed that people with type 2 diabetes have lower leg (men only) and grip strength (3) and that after 6 years’ follow-up, they lose leg but not grip strength at a greater rate than healthy counterparts of comparable age (4,5).  Because skeletal muscle function is associated with health outcomes, this lower muscle function could contribute to the greater risk of developing comorbidities and mortality in people with type 2 diabetes. Thus, in addition to the accelerated loss of muscle mass/function, people with type 2 diabetes have been shown to be at a greater risk of all-cause and CVD mortality (6,7), with this risk higher again the longer a person has type 2 diabetes (8,9). Prior research reported that within a group of people (mean age 63.6 years) with impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes (n = 12,516), a higher grip strength is associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (10), reflecting the findings observed in general population studies. This analysis was, however, only adjusted for BMI, waist circumference, and hip circumference and not for wider lifestyle factors and had no comparison of this relationship with that of people without diabetes. Whether this relationship holds after more robust adjustment and how these risks compare with people without type 2 diabetes remains to be established.

However, rather than grip strength having a causally protective effect versus mortality or subsequent disease incidence, it may be a marker of generally better health at baseline, and although we attempted to reduce the potential for reverse causality and confounding in our analysis by performing 2-year landmark analysis and excluding individuals with a medical diagnosis of chronic comorbidities at baseline, the potential for both to influence the results remains. Another limitation of the current study is data bias because the study only included people with diabetes who had survived long enough to be recruited into the study, i.e., many people with diabetes who would have been eligible for inclusion in this study will have already died. Diabetes was ascertained by self-report of a physician diagnosis; therefore, incomplete ascertainment is possible but unlikely to introduce a systematic error. In the SHIELD (Study to Help Improve Early evaluation and management of risk factors Leading to Diabetes) screening survey, Bays et al. (33) reported that the prevalence of diabetes is similar when based solely on self-report compared with clinical and laboratory corroboration of self-reports, as in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Schneider et al. (34) also showed that self-reported diabetes is >92% reliable and 83% sensitive. We were unable to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but with the exclusion of participants <30 years of age at diagnosis, the overwhelming majority of cases will be type 2 diabetes. Data on physical activity and sedentary behavior was self-reported, which has limitations in accuracy (35) and does not capture specific forms of exercise, such as resistance training, likely to have an effect on the associations we have observed in the current study. In all studies involving nutritional epidemiology, uncertainties always exist in estimating long-term dietary intake, and all methods of dietary assessment can incur both random and systematic errors, the former of which can be diminished but not eliminated by studying large numbers (36,37). In the current study, dietary intake was self-reported outside the clinic, which may encourage more truthful reporting. In addition, online administration of the questionnaires is expected to minimize reporting bias as a result of social desirability. The information was collected by using a 24-h recall questionnaire, which has been shown to produce more accurate results than a food frequency questionnaire (the usual approach adopted in large-scale studies) (38).""",Partially,"Missing direction and magnitude for impact of survivor bias ""This study has several strengths and limitations. Although UK Biobank is not representative of the general population, with evidence of a healthy volunteer selection bias, the valid assessment of exposure-disease relationships may be widely generalizable and does not require participants to be representative of the population at large (31,32). Therefore, caution should be heeded in generalizing summary statistics, such as the prevalence of diabetes and obesity, to the general population. This does not detract from the ability to generalize estimates of the magnitude of associations. The current study benefited from a large number of participants recruited from the general population across the U.K. We had sufficient power to undertake analysis by age and grip strength categories. However, rather than grip strength having a causally protective effect versus mortality or subsequent disease incidence, it may be a marker of generally better health at baseline, and although we attempted to reduce the potential for reverse causality and confounding in our analysis by performing 2-year landmark analysis and excluding individuals with a medical diagnosis of chronic comorbidities at baseline, the potential for both to influence the results remains. Another limitation of the current study is data bias because the study only included people with diabetes who had survived long enough to be recruited into the study, i.e., many people with diabetes who would have been eligible for inclusion in this study will have already died. Diabetes was ascertained by self-report of a physician diagnosis; therefore, incomplete ascertainment is possible but unlikely to introduce a systematic error. In the SHIELD (Study to Help Improve Early evaluation and management of risk factors Leading to Diabetes) screening survey, Bays et al. (33) reported that the prevalence of diabetes is similar when based solely on self-report compared with clinical and laboratory corroboration of self-reports, as in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Schneider et al. (34) also showed that self-reported diabetes is >92% reliable and 83% sensitive. We were unable to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but with the exclusion of participants <30 years of age at diagnosis, the overwhelming majority of cases will be type 2 diabetes. Data on physical activity and sedentary behavior was self-reported, which has limitations in accuracy (35) and does not capture specific forms of exercise, such as resistance training, likely to have an effect on the associations we have observed in the current study. In all studies involving nutritional epidemiology, uncertainties always exist in estimating long-term dietary intake, and all methods of dietary assessment can incur both random and systematic errors, the former of which can be diminished but not eliminated by studying large numbers (36,37). In the current study, dietary intake was self-reported outside the clinic, which may encourage more truthful reporting. In addition, online administration of the questionnaires is expected to minimize reporting bias as a result of social desirability.

The findings suggest that grip strength has clinical utility in identifying people with diabetes at risk for poor health outcomes.

Conclusions The impact of medications for chronic pain and sleep upon CM health and obesity is of concern for these classes of drugs which have been recently labelled as dependency forming medications. The results from this cross sectional study warrants further investigation and adds further support to calls for these medications to be prescribed for shorter periods.""",Yes,"""Introduction Obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes represent significant personal, societal and economic burden [1,2]. The inter-relationship between metabolic and cardiovascular disease is termed cardio-metabolic (CM) health. Those with both CVD and type 2 diabetes have a particularly poor prognosis and require aggressive risk factor intervention [3]. Obesity now affects 34.9% of all US adults and 26% of UK adults with a greater than doubling of the prevalence over the last 30 years [4].  There is increasing recognition of the metabolic impact of many prescribed analgesic medications used for relief of chronic pain. Certain medications have been used far more widely in recent years, in particular those for chronic non cancer pain. This includes opioids, the alpha2delta ligands pregabilin and gabapentin and certain antidepressants shown to decrease neuropathic pain, in particular amitriptyline and more recently duloxetine which is specifically licensed for diabetic neuropathic pain. Many of these medications have been labelled as dependence-forming medications (DFM) whereby patients require continual use to maintain a state of normality and avoid symptoms of withdrawal [5]. Prescribing data shows a substantial rise in these prescriptions over the last ten years in the UK and the US. An estimated 3–4% of US adults are prescribed opioids [6]. The use of strong opioids has increased alongside gabapentin and pregabilin [7].  The increased use of opioid medication has led to increasing recognition of their side effects when used chronically and the use of long term opioid medication has become increasingly controversial with recent, far reaching changes to reduce prescribing in the US [8]. The dangers of addiction, sleep disordered breathing, daytime sedation and accidental overdose are well known and researched [9]. The impact of opioids upon appetite, metabolism and the insulin axis is less well studied [10]. More recently cohort studies have suggested that those using chronic opiate prescriptions in particular have an increased mortality rate from all causes but there may be many confounding factors when studying those with chronic pain and the reasons for this association remain debated [11].  Weight gain with neuropathic pain meds is described but often in small studies looking at the impact upon the first 6–12 weeks of prescription [12,13]. There have been few large studies addressing the potential association between commonly prescribed analgesic drugs and CM health. However, smaller studies following patients prescribed gabapentin, pregabilin, amitriptyline have shown increased BMI in those followed up between periods of 3–6 months. Weight gain is cited as one of the commonest reasons for discontinuing these medications [14]. Opiates have been shown to cause insulin resistance but whether they clearly cause weight gain over time remains debated [10]. Many of the analgesic drugs cause sedation and increase the risk of sleep disordered breathing. Sleep disturbance in itself causes insulin resistance with increasing recognition of the association between sleep and circadian rhythm disturbance, worse CM health and increased obesity [15].""",Yes,"""There have been few large studies addressing the potential association between commonly prescribed analgesic drugs and CM health.""",Yes,"""Our primary aim was to assess CM health in those taking commonly prescribed analgesic drugs. Our secondary objective was to further explore associations with lifestyle factors such as physical activity, diet and sleep duration to try and understand the mechanism of any metabolic disturbance.  Given that many participants are prescribed combinations of opiates and neuropathic pain relief, we elected to study those on any combination of prescribed analgesic medication including opiates, antidepressants recommended for chronic pain and the alpha2delta ligands pregabilin and gabapentin. We hypothesized that this group would be more likely to have poor CM health and increased obesity and that this association would persist as an independent risk factor when controlling for other lifestyle factors.""",Yes,Methods on page 2,Yes,"""Around 9.2 million invitations were mailed to recruit 502,664 adults (response rate 5.5%) aged between 37 and 73 years.

In the Health Surveys for England (HSE) 1995, 1996, 2001 and Scottish Health Surveys (SHS) 1998 and 2003 combined, there were 500 deaths among 6579 white never-smokers aged 40–69 years at entry, followed for a mean of 13.9 years. SD (z) scores for forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were derived using Global Lung Initiative 2012 reference equations. These z-scores were related to deaths from all causes, circulatory disease and cancers using proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, height, socioeconomic status, region and survey.""",Yes,"""Results In the HSE–SHS data set, decreasing z-scores for FEV1 (zFEV1) and FVC (zFVC) were each associated to a similar degree with increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratios per unit decrement 1.17, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25 for zFEV1 and 1.19, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.28 for zFVC). This was replicated in Biobank (HRs 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.26 and 1.24, 1.19 to 1.29, respectively). zFEV1 and zFVC were less strongly associated with mortality from circulatory diseases in HSE–SHS (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.40 for zFVC) than in Biobank (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.60 for zFVC). For cancer mortality, HRs were more consistent between cohorts (for zFVC: HRs 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.24 in HSE–SHS and 1.10, 1.05 to 1.15 in Biobank). The strongest associations were with respiratory mortality (for zFVC: HRs 1.61, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.08 in HSE–SHS and 2.15, 1.77 to 2.61 in Biobank).""",Yes,"""Four decades of epidemiological research have consistently shown that reduced levels of ventilatory function, measured as one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FVC), are associated with higher all-cause mortality rates, and therefore shorter survival in the general population.1–7 Few studies have reported specifically on lifelong non-smokers,3 4 a group which form the minority of most populations surveyed hitherto, but are set to become more common in future as smoking becomes less prevalent in higher income countries.  Most publications have focused on FEV1, but a recent analysis7 of asymptomatic participants in the multiethnic Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study reported that all-cause mortality was strongly associated with diminished FVC, after adjustment for FEV1, but not the other way around, and there was no association between survival and the ratio of FEV1 to FVC.

Outlying observations were excluded by restricting all the analyses in both data sets to values of zFEV1 and zFVC within the range −5 to +5 z-score units.

The z-scores are expressed on a SD scale, so HRs for zFEV1 and zFVC are expressed per unit decrement (ie, an increase in risk for a decrease in lung function). A typical range of z-scores among lifelong non-smokers would be 4 units. A HR of 1.2 per unit decrement corresponds approximately to a twofold difference in mortality rate across this range.  Due to the high correlation between zFEV1 and zFVC among lifelong non-smokers (0.88 in Biobank, 0.80 in national health survey participants aged 40–69 years), we modelled the association of mortality with zFEV1 both alone and jointly with zFEVFVC, and similarly for zFVC. Among never-smokers, the correlations between zFEV1 and zFEVFVC (0.35 in Biobank, 0.36 in the national surveys) and between zFVC and zFEVFVC (−0.13 in Biobank, −0.20 in the national surveys) were weak enough to avoid major collinearity in the joint models. The significance of the HR for zFEVFVC when modelled jointly with zFEV1 was used to assess whether zFVC predicted mortality independent of zFEV1, and vice versa when zFEVFVC was modelled jointly with zFEV1.  All proportional hazards models were restricted to white participants and adjusted for sex, age, standing height, socioeconomic status and region. Analyses of data from the five national health surveys were additionally adjusted for survey year as a categorical variable. Since each survey was conducted in a different year, inclusion of survey year in the model is closely equivalent to a fixed-effect meta-analysis of the results from each of the five surveys. In a more formal two-stage individual participant meta-analysis for all-cause mortality in lifelong non-smokers, there was no substantial or significant heterogeneity of HRs among the five national health surveys (I²=0.0%, p=0.775 for zFEV1; I²=10.5%, p=0.346 for zFVC). Therefore, for simplicity of presentation we report results for the five national surveys combined, but analyse UKB separately because one of our objectives is to investigate how closely these two sets of results correspond. Heterogeneity between HRs for the pooled national surveys and UKB was assessed by testing the significance of the difference between the corresponding log-HRs from these two data sets.  The assumption of proportionality of hazards was assessed by log-log plots and by fitting zFEV1 or zFVC as a time-dependent covariate in the model. No strong or statistically significant evidence of time dependence emerged for all-cause mortality among lifelong non-smokers. Nevertheless, results for all-cause mortality were partitioned at 5 years of follow-up for two reasons. First, because the minimum duration of follow-up in UKB was 4.87 years, so virtually all of that cohort had been followed for 5 years or more, allowing a more direct comparison with results from the national health surveys, all of which had been followed for more than 5 years. The second reason for partitioning at 5 years was to address the possibility of reverse causation (impaired spirometric performance due to pre-existing conditions which lead to early death). Reverse causation was also investigated by analysing mortality in subgroups with no prior history of respiratory disease, circulatory disease or cancer.""",Partially,"""Reverse causation was also investigated by analysing mortality in subgroups with no prior history of respiratory disease, circulatory disease or cancer.""",No,"""Online supplementary e-table 3 shows that within UKB the general pattern of results was similar in both sexes.

We used these factors to develop a scoring system and identified a point cut off that 104,723 individuals (29.5%), including 170 of the 220 cases with EAC, were above.

Overall survival is <20%.2 Methods to improve early diagnosis are important3 because the poor survival is largely attributable to late clinical presentation with advanced disease.2  Endoscopy with biopsies for histologic confirmation is the gold standard method of detecting esophageal and gastric cancers.4, 5 However, population-wide endoscopy screening programs are unlikely to be cost-effective or feasible because of the low incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancers and the cost, invasiveness, and psychological burden of endoscopy screening.6  Clinical guidelines suggest that individuals with chronic symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) should be referred for endoscopy screening to identify Barrett’s esophagus,7 a precursor to EAC present in 1%–2% of the adult population.8 Individuals with Barrett’s esophagus are often entered into endoscopy surveillance programs.9 Use of GERD as the sole initial triage factor for endoscopy is appealing in its simplicity, but delays in obtaining endoscopy are common in part because of a lack of both specificity, because risk of EAC in individuals with GERD is low,10, 11 and sensitivity, because a large proportion of EAC cases (∼40%) never report GERD symptoms.11  Automated clinical risk prediction tools using data easily accessible to primary care physicians to flag high-risk individuals may offer a lower cost method to improve early detection and are being investigated for other conditions.12 Established risk factors including body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and GERD may be useful for risk prediction of EAC13, 14, 15 and Barrett’s esophagus.16, 17, 18 However, existing studies have relied on age and sex matched case-control data, which may be subject to recall bias and ignore age and sex in improving the risk prediction, which are strong risk factors.19 An assessment of traditional risk factors may be useful as triage directly to endoscopy, in which case risk prediction for any upper gastrointestinal cancers diagnosed via endoscopy would be most informative.

Cardiometabolic disorders previously diagnosed by a physician were self-reported by the participants. Similarly, mood disorder features were self-reported, rather than assessed using a formal diagnostic interview, although a structured approach was used (Appendix). Psychiatric diagnoses based on formal interviews were not practical within UK Biobank, so we took a pragmatic approach to mood disorder groupings. It is possible that our criteria for mood disorder are less stringent than formal diagnostic criteria. It should be noted, however, that we are reporting features of mood disorders at a population level, rather than formal clinical diagnoses, and we were unable to validate diagnoses because of the lack of availability of definitive diagnostic information. Similarly, because of a lack of definitive cardiometabolic diagnostic information we were unable to validate outcome measures. This lack of validation for both cardiometabolic and psychiatric diagnoses has implications in terms of the likely sensitivity and specificity of our groupings, which are based on self-report. Linkage to routine hospital and general practice health records will be available in the future and will allow some validation of these groups.  There is, however, evidence for the validity of these groupings using internal variables, 19 for example, the gender distributions of approximately 1:1 for bipolar disorder and approximately 2:1 (women:men) for depression are consistent with a large body of epidemiological research on lifetime rates of mood disorder in men and women. 20,21 Furthermore, the lifetime prevalence rates for bipolar disorder (1.1%) and recurrent major depressive disorder (21.2%) are consistent with other population-based lifetime estimates. 15  Although we are reasonably confident that members of the control groups did not have significant features of depression or bipolar disorder, it should be noted that a proportion may have fulfilled criteria for other mental illnesses, such as anxiety disorder or, less likely, schizophrenia, both of which have been associated with poor cardiometabolic health. 19,22,23 There are also limitations with our broad definition of current psychotropic medication use that groups together different classes of medication. In a subanalysis of individuals on psychotropic monotherapy, we found that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), other antidepressants and sedatives/hypnotics were all associated with greater risk of myocardial infarction relative to psychotropic-free controls (SSRIs OR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.51–2.21; other antidepressants OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.20–1.87; and sedatives/hypnotics OR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.76–3.66). It is therefore possible that adverse cardiovascular outcomes in depressive disorders are not limited to the use of antipsychotics but may also be a consequence of other classes of psychotropic medications.  A relatively low proportion of the mood disorder features groups reported taking psychotropic medication (bipolar features 32.1%, depressive features 20.6% and controls 3.4%) but, as noted above, the focus in this study was not clinically diagnosed mood disordered groups but rather lifetime features of mood disorder at a population level. Poor adherence with medication may be an issue. According to some estimates, up to 50% of patients prescribed psychotropic medication do not take their medication regularly. 24–26 Although adherence for physical health medications may be slightly better than this, 27 it is likely that the factors that cause poor adherence with psychotropic medication may also lead to poor adherence with cardiovascular medications in individuals with mood disorders. This might explain the proportionately worse cardiovascular outcomes in a less adherent mood disordered group compared with a more adherent non-mood disordered group. As a result of the level of information on medication status that was collected at baseline, we were unable to assess the impact of duration of exposure to psychotropic medication on adverse cardiometabolic outcomes.  We included a range of possible confounding variables in the regression models but were unable to control for physical activity. The available data on physical activity were not collected in terms of standardised measures. Unfortunately, it was not possible to create a standardised measure, such as the metabolic equivalent of task (MET). Similarly, we were unable to adjust for the potential confounding effects of diet. When considering appropriate variables to include as confounding variables, it is important to note that there is uncertainty as to the extent that these variables might represent confounders or mediators. For example, obesity may represent an important component of the pathophysiology for depression, bipolar disorder and coronary heart disease.

Unfortunately, it was not possible to create a standardised measure, such as the metabolic equivalent of task (MET). Similarly, we were unable to adjust for the potential confounding effects of diet. When considering appropriate variables to include as confounding variables, it is important to note that there is uncertainty as to the extent that these variables might represent confounders or mediators.

However, the research evidence is equivocal. Moreover, understanding the double burden of these factors is a matter of public health importance. The purpose of this study was to test associations of neighbourhood fast-food outlet exposure and household income, in relation to frequency of consumption of processed meat and multiple measures of adiposity, and to examine possible interactions.  Methods We employed an observational, cross-sectional study design. In a cohort of 51,361 adults aged 38–72 years in Greater London, UK, we jointly classified participants based on household income (£/year, four groups) and GIS-derived neighbourhood fast-food outlet proportion (counts of fast-food outlets as a percentage of all food outlets, quartiles). Multivariable regression models estimated main effects and interactions (additive and multiplicative) of household income and fast-food outlet proportion on odds of self-reported frequent processed meat consumption (> 1/week), measured BMI (kg/m2), body fat (%), and odds of obesity (BMI ≥ 30).""",Yes,"""Results Income and fast-food proportion were independently, systematically associated with BMI, body fat, obesity and frequent processed meat consumption. Odds of obesity were greater for lowest income participants compared to highest (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.41, 1.69) and for those most-exposed to fast-food outlets compared to least-exposed (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.40, 1.64). In jointly classified models, lowest income and highest fast-food outlet proportion in combination were associated with greater odds of obesity (OR = 2.43, 95% CI: 2.09, 2.84), with relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI = 0.03). Results were similar for frequent processed meat consumption models. There was no evidence of interaction on a multiplicative scale between fast-food outlet proportion and household income on each of BMI (P = 0.230), obesity (P = 0.054) and frequent processed meat consumption (P = 0.725).  Conclusions Our study demonstrated independent associations of neighbourhood fast-food outlet exposure and household income, in relation to diet and multiple objective measures of adiposity, in a large sample of UK adults. Moreover, we provide evidence of the double burden of low income and an unhealthy neighbourhood food environment, furthering our understanding of how these factors contribute jointly to social inequalities in health.""",Yes,"""Background Unhealthy diet and high body weight are key modifiable risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes and some cancers. According to the WHO’s Global Burden of Disease study, dietary risks and high body weight are two of the top three contributors to the number of years suffered with disability and morbidity in the UK [1]. Food-related ill health in the UK, driven by unhealthy diet, contributes to 10% of the combined mortality and morbidity burden [2]. Processed meat consumption, in particular, is associated with higher incidence of type-2 diabetes, coronary heart disease [3,4,5], and certain cancers [6].  Social inequalities in diet and obesity are established across markers of socioeconomic position (SEP) such as education, income (including household income [7]) and occupation [8], and may be contributing to recognised inequalities in NCD risk [9, 10]. Explanations include having less knowledge about healthy eating and fewer cooking skills [11, 12], and less time for cooking at home among socially disadvantaged groups [13]. Low-income groups, in particular, are also more price-sensitive [14], spending less on food overall and per calorie than other social groups [15].  In addition to individual-level socioeconomic determinants, neighbourhood food environments are also potentially important influences on diet and weight [16, 17], although the research evidence remains equivocal [18, 19]. Neighbourhoods where the mix of food retailing is biased towards a high proportion of fast-food outlets may be especially influential [20,21,22] – where fast-food might be perceived as the easier choice and therefore used more, and where greater fast-food access is not simply a function of greater access to all types of food outlet [23]. As a result, recent studies have increasingly situated fast-food access within the wider context of overall neighbourhood food retailing through adopting relative as opposed to absolute measures of exposure [24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. Easier access to fast-food outlets may facilitate the consumption of energy dense, nutrient poor fast foods [31, 32], which have been linked prospectively to excess weight gain [33], and associated with other cardio-metabolic risk factors [34]. Despite some fast-food outlets selling ‘healthier’ foods than others, at a population level, visits to and use of fast-food outlets has been linked to weight gain over time [35], and consumption of a less healthy diet and greater odds of obesity [36], respectively.  Fast-food access may also contribute to established social inequalities in fast-food consumption and weight [37]. Deprived neighbourhoods have generally greater numbers of fast-food outlets [16, 38], and there is evidence that the influence of neighbourhood environments vary by educational attainment as a marker of SEP [39]. However, there has been little research on the interaction between fast-food access and household income, which may hold implications for diet and weight via different mechanisms. Low-income consumers, in particular, may be disproportionately affected by the presence of fast-food outlets [14], which serve large portions of energy-dense, calorific foods at low prices [40].  With mounting evidence of the adverse influence of fast-food outlets on health and the abundance of fast-food outlets in deprived areas, the proliferation of these outlets has become a public health concern. Policies are now in place in many regions of the UK to stem growth in this retail sector [41], while in the US, a moratorium was placed on the opening of new fast-food outlets in South Los Angeles, for example [42]. At the same time, more empirical research is needed to better understand the magnitude of influence of fast-food outlets on health and their contribution to social inequalities.""",Yes,"""At the same time, more empirical research is needed to better understand the magnitude of influence of fast-food outlets on health and their contribution to social inequalities.""",Yes,"""Using a large sample from the UK Biobank, the aim of this study was to establish the independent and combined associations (including interactions) of each of neighbourhood fast-food access and household income, with processed meat consumption and multiple measures of adiposity.""",Yes,Methods on page 2,Yes,"""UK Biobank is a cross-sectional, observational cohort study, which recruited 502,656 people between 2006 and 2010.

While residential location constitutes an important daily anchor point [69], ensuring relevance of assessing neighbourhood food outlet exposure around this location, we could not assess exposure to the food environment within wider activity spaces [70]. That said, research has shown that magnitude of non-residential neighbourhood food outlet exposure is unrelated to that of residential exposure [71, 72], resulting in random error (not bias) that would have likely served to attenuate our parameter estimates towards the null [73].

The largest of these indicated that 1 interquartile range higher air pollutant exposure was associated on average with 0.35% slower reaction time (95% CI: 0.13, 0.57), a 2.92% higher error rate on a visuospatial memory test (95% CI: 1.24, 4.62), and numeric memory scores that were 0.58 points lower (95% CI: −0.96, −0.19). Follow-up analyses of cognitive change scores did not show evidence of associations. The findings indicate that in this sample, which is five-fold larger than any previous cross-sectional study, the association between air pollution exposure and cognitive performance was weak. Ongoing follow-up of the UK Biobank cohort will allow investigation of longer-term associations into old age, including longitudinal tracking of cognitive performance and incident dementia outcomes.""",Yes,"""Introduction Outdoor air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and ground-level ozone (O3) are associated with acute and chronic illnesses including cancer, asthma, stroke, heart disease and diabetes1. Possible links with cognitive decline have received research attention over the past decade, summarised in five recent systematic reviews2,3,4,5,6. Although confounding background factors such as deprivation and education may partially account for observed associations with cognitive outcomes, it has been postulated that exposure to air pollution has a causal influence via harmful effects on the brain. There is evidence from animal and human studies that air pollutants are linked to inflammatory processes and morphological changes in the brain, such as upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin-1 alpha and beta, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha), activation of microglia and reactive oxygen species, alpha-synuclein deposition, and decreases in dendritic spine density and branching in the hippocampus7,8,9,10,11. These may result from infiltration of pollutants such as ultrafine particulate matter into brain tissue, via the olfactory nerve or the blood-brain barrier11,12, with possible contributions through pulmonary inflammation and downstream effects on systemic circulation13. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality are elevated in association with air pollution exposure14,15,16, and neuroimaging studies have shown associations with atrophy, infarcts, white matter hyperintensities and altered cerebrovascular haemodynamics17,18.  Associations of generally small effect size have been reported in cross-sectional studies of air pollution exposure and cognitive test performance19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26, although others have reported primarily null results27,28. Inconsistent small or null effects have also been shown in studies of cognitive score change over intervals of two to five years29,30,31. A smaller number of studies have examined associations with clinical cognitive disorders. In cross-sectional and case-control studies, air pollutant exposure has been linked with greater odds of global and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI)32 and Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia33. Cohort studies investigating dementia incidence over follow-up periods of up to 15 years have reported greater hazard ratios associated with air pollutant exposure34,35,36 and proximity to major roads37. Heterogeneity of study populations, measures and statistical adjustment methods means that none of the five systematic reviews published to date has included a meta-analysis of effect size estimates. Considerable uncertainty therefore remains regarding the likely magnitude of any association.  Large study samples are needed for the reliable detection of associations of small effect size. Cross-sectional studies investigating the relationship between air pollution exposure and performance on cognitive tests have used samples ranging from n = 39922 to n = 15,97326, and longitudinal studies of cognitive score change have ranged from n = 2,86730 to n = 20,15029. The inconsistent findings and imprecision of the effect size estimates from these studies may indicate the need for samples which are larger still. Previous studies have also varied considerably in the air pollutant exposures that have been measured—most frequently particulate matter, with gas pollutants studied less often—and in the outcomes investigated, encompassing a range of different cognitive assessments or dementia diagnoses. Furthermore, the type and number of possible confounding variables adjusted in statistical analyses have varied widely: most studies have adjusted for sociodemographic factors (including age, gender, ethnicity, education and socioeconomic status), and some have taken account of lifestyle factors such as smoking and physical activity. No study to date has examined the influence of time spent outdoors, despite the fact that the pollution measures predominantly capture neighbourhood air quality rather than individual-level exposure; it might be expected that the magnitude of the relationship between neighbourhood pollution measures and cognitive outcomes would be greater among those who spend more time outdoors.""",Yes,"""No study to date has examined the influence of time spent outdoors, despite the fact that the pollution measures predominantly capture neighbourhood air quality rather than individual-level exposure; it might be expected that the magnitude of the relationship between neighbourhood pollution measures and cognitive outcomes would be greater among those who spend more time outdoors.  The UK Biobank resource38 offers an opportunity to address some of these limitations. More than half a million adults in middle to early old age were included in the UK Biobank cohort at baseline. Importantly, although the air pollution measures were taken at the neighbourhood level, participants also provided individual information regarding length of time typically spent outdoors. Moreover, a subset of the cohort returned for repeat cognitive assessment between two and seven years post-baseline, thus permitting both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. This is the largest study to date of air pollution and cognitive test performance, with standardised measurement of multiple pollutant exposures, cognitive outcomes and potential confounders, in a single general population cohort.""",Yes,"""The aims of this study were to estimate the association between baseline neighbourhood-level exposure to airborne pollutants and (1) cognitive test performance at baseline and (2) cognitive score change between baseline and follow-up, taking account of confounding factors and the potential moderating influence of time spent outdoors.""",No,Methods on page 9,Yes,"""Adults aged 40 to 69 years who were registered with the National Health Service (NHS) and living within 25 miles of a study assessment centre were invited by mail to participate in UK Biobank38.

Air pollution measures UK Biobank air pollution data: Air pollution and local environment measures were provided by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (http://www.sahsu.org/) as part of the BioSHaRE-EU Environmental Determinants of Health Project (http://www.bioshare.eu/), and were linked centrally to the assessment data by UK Biobank analysts (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/docs/EnviroExposEst.pdf). These measures were modelled at participants’ baseline residential addresses. A total of 7,221 addresses (approximately 1.4%) could not be geo-coded and therefore have missing data. Particulate matter of up to 10 μm diameter (PM10, PM2.5 to 10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and total nitrogen oxides (NOx) were measured as annual average values in μg/m3. Estimates for the years 2005 to 2007 were derived from European Union (EU)-wide air pollution maps (resolution 100 m × 100 m). The X, Y coordinates of participants’ baseline addresses were overlaid on these maps (projected to the British National Grid) and the corresponding air pollution concentration of the 100 m × 100 m grid cell was assigned to the coordinate. These data were from a land use regression (LUR) model for western Europe based on >1500 EuroAirnet monitoring sites, which also included satellite-derived air pollution estimates to improve the model performance44. Estimates for the year 2010 were modelled for each address using a LUR model developed as part of the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE; http://www.escapeproject.eu/)45,46. ESCAPE estimates for PM in 2010 are valid up to 400 km from the monitoring area (Greater London), but the accuracy of estimates beyond this range (n = 33,935 addresses) was unknown and so these were coded as missing within the central UK Biobank dataset. Where a pollutant measure was available for more than one year, data for the earliest available year were analysed, to minimise uncertainty about the temporal order of exposure and outcome. The PM10 measure was for 2007; PM2.5 to 10 and PM2.5 were for 2010; NO2 was for 2005; and NOx was for 2010.  Defra air pollution data: The UK Biobank air pollution data described above were mapped to participants’ baseline addresses, without taking account of address history at the time the pollutant measure was recorded. Separate data were made available subsequently by UK Biobank regarding participants’ past address history (east and north coordinates rounded to 1 km), and the date the participant was first recorded at each location. These were used in the present study to map air pollution data provided by the UK Government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) (https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data). Modelled data47 for the same pollutants in the same years as above (PM10 for 2007; PM2.5 to 10 and PM2.5 for 2010; NO2 for 2005; and NOx for 2010) were mapped to participants’ addresses in the relevant year. These data were used only in sensitivity analyses, described below.  Other local environment measures Population density (urban/rural) was classified categorically by UK Biobank, by combining each participant’s baseline residential postcode with data generated from the 2001 census, using the GeoConvert tool provided by the UK Data Service Census Support (http://geoconvert.mimas.ac.uk/). Road traffic measures were provided for the year 2008 from the Road Traffic Statistics Branch at the Department for Transport attached to the local road network; traffic data for unmonitored links were estimates based on surrounding monitored links. A major road was defined as a road with traffic intensity >5000 motor vehicles per 24 hours. Traffic intensity on the nearest major road was measured as the average total number of motor vehicles per 24 hours. Proximity to the nearest major road was calculated as the inverse distance (1/m) from the residential location. Data were also available regarding noise pollution, and these were included in supplementary analyses to address potential residual confounding (see Data analysis section below). Noise estimates for the year 2009 were modelled using a version of the Common NOise aSSessment methOdS (CNOSSOS-EU) noise model48,49; average level of noise pollution in decibels was calculated as a weighted level measured over a 24-hour period, with a 10 decibel penalty added between 23:00 h and 07:00 h.  Sociodemographic and lifestyle measures Age was recorded in whole years. Gender was self-reported as male or female. Self-reported ethnic background was grouped categorically as white, Asian/Asian British, black/black British, Chinese, or mixed/other ethnic group. Neighbourhood-level socioeconomic status was measured using the Townsend index of material deprivation50. This was calculated by UK Biobank immediately before the baseline date, based on census data regarding unemployment, car ownership, home ownership and household overcrowding; each participant was assigned a score corresponding to the census output area in which their residential postcode was located, with higher values indicating greater relative deprivation (see Supplementary Methods). Educational qualifications were self-reported, and for the present study were dichotomised according to whether or not participants held a university/college degree. Self-reported smoking status data were used by UK Biobank to categorise participants as current, former or never smokers; these were dichotomised for the present study as ‘ever smoker’ (current or former) versus ‘never smoker’. Physical activity in a typical week was recorded using self-reported items from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form51, and was converted into a single measure of total physical activity in metabolic equivalent of task (MET) hours per week, weighted by intensity (walking, moderate or vigorous). Participants were asked to estimate how many hours they spent outdoors in a typical day in summer, and in a typical day in winter. Responses were given in whole hours from 0 to 24, and participants whose responses exceeded 10 were asked to check and confirm this. An additional option of ‘Less than an hour a day’ was available, and for the present study was assigned a value of 0.5. Overall time outdoors was calculated as the mean of the hours per day in summer and winter together.  Cognitive assessment The format and psychometric properties of the cognitive tests used in UK Biobank have been described by us previously39,52. All tests were administered visually via touchscreen, and scoring was automated. The tasks assessed reasoning (total correct of 13 items), reaction time (mean time in milliseconds to press a button in response to matching cards), numeric memory (longest numeric string recalled in reverse), visuospatial memory (‘pairs matching’ test: total errors when recalling positions of matching cards) and prospective memory (successfully carrying out an instruction after a filled delay). Higher values indicate better performance on the reasoning and numeric memory tests, and worse performance on the reaction time and pairs matching tests. Prospective memory test performance was categorised dichotomously as 1 for a correct response on the first attempt and 0 otherwise. Details of all tests are provided in the Supplementary Methods. The numeric memory test was removed from the UK Biobank baseline assessment battery part-way through recruitment, for reasons of time, resulting in lower sample sizes on this test than on the other four tests.  Change on the cognitive tests was measured by subtracting the baseline score from the follow-up score. Raw scores were used in these calculations, without any replacement of outlying values. Negative change score values on the reasoning test indicate worse performance at follow-up; positive change score values on the reaction time test indicate slower performance at follow-up; positive change score values on the pairs matching test indicate more errors at follow-up. Change on the prospective memory test was dichotomised as ‘worse at follow-up’ = 1, versus ‘same or better at follow-up’ = 0 (i.e., ‘worse at follow-up’ means the participant gave the correct response at baseline and an incorrect response at follow-up).

Data were summarised descriptively to characterise the baseline and follow-up samples. Quintiles were derived for the measures of major road proximity, traffic intensity, noise pollution, physical activity and time outdoors, based on all available data in the whole UK Biobank cohort at baseline. Regression models were used to estimate the association between air pollution exposures (independent variable) and cognitive performance (dependent variable), with and without adjustment for other covariates. The pollutant data provided centrally by UK Biobank were used in all primary analyses, and sensitivity analyses were conducted using the Defra data (see below). Multicollinearity between the air pollution measures and the covariates was within acceptable limits (variance inflation factor values 1.77 to 1.96). For all models, normal-approximation 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated from bootstrapped standard errors (5000 replicates)54. Since there were 25 cross-sectional and 20 follow-up regression analyses, p values (two-tailed) for the pollutant coefficients were adjusted using the Simes-Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method55; both unadjusted and FDR-adjusted p values are reported. Alpha was 0.05 (FDR-adjusted). ‘Do not know’ and ‘Prefer not to answer’ responses were treated as missing. Missing data were not imputed.  For the cross-sectional analyses, each baseline cognitive measure was regressed separately on each air pollution measure (continuous), firstly in unadjusted models and then with adjustment for baseline age, gender, ethnic group, Townsend score (continuous), education, smoking status, physical activity (quintiles), time outdoors (quintiles), major road proximity (quintiles), traffic intensity (quintiles), and population density category. The Supplementary Methods shows a directed acyclic graph of the assumptions underpinning the analytical model: the aim of covariate adjustment was to minimise confounding influences on the association between air pollution exposure and cognitive performance, rather than to construct a multivariable risk prediction model for cognitive outcome. Linear regression was used for the reasoning and numeric memory scores, which were approximately normally distributed, and unstandardized coefficients are reported. Positive skew in the reaction time distribution was addressed using a natural log transformation, and linear regression was then used; exponentiated results are reported as rate ratios (RR). Outlying pairs matching error count values (>30; n = 49, 0.06%) were replaced with a value of 30, and only participants who finished the task (achieved all six pairs) were included in the analyses.

It was predicted that associations would be stronger among those who spent the most time outdoors, either because spending time outdoors exposes individuals to more pollution, or because the neighbourhood-level measure would more accurately reflect actual pollutant exposure in those who spent more time outdoors.

Missing covariate data The unadjusted regression models were based on all available data, which meant that differences between unadjusted and adjusted estimates may have been partly due to the inclusion of different participants (all available in the unadjusted model, versus only those with complete covariate data in the adjusted). The unadjusted models were therefore repeated using only participants who had complete covariate data.

Table 3,Yes,"""Data analysis The regression models included covariates chosen to minimise confounding influences on the association between air pollution exposure and cognitive performance. The assumptions underpinning the analytical model were depicted in a directed acyclic graph, and DAGitty software 2 was used to derive an appropriate covariate adjustment set. DAGitty uses an algorithm to determine whether adjusting for certain covariates will block confounding paths in the graph, based on the directional relationships that are depicted between the nodes in the graph. The algorithm uses the rules of ‘d-separation’ 3 ; it is based solely on the structure of the graph, not on any measured data. Supplementary Figure S1a below shows the variables (nodes) and their putative inter-relationships (arrows) that are assumed to give rise to the predicted association between neighbourhood air pollution exposure and cognitive performance; paths representing potential confounding influences are shown in red. Given these assumptions, the DAGitty algorithm determined a minimum sufficient adjustment set to block these confounding paths (Supplementary Figure S1b; blocked confounding paths shown in black). Ethnic group was not part of the minimum adjustment set, but was included as a covariate in the main analyses in this study because of its inclusion in other key studies in the literature; adding this to the adjustment set did not re-introduce bias according to the graph assumptions (Supplementary Figure S1c: main analysis model). Noise pollution was also added to the covariate adjustment set in supplementary analyses: although the graph structure indicated that confounding paths that included noise pollution should already be blocked following adjustment for deprivation, population density, road proximity, traffic intensity and time outdoors (Supplementary Figure S1c), the addition of noise pollution to the covariate adjustment set (Supplementary Figure S1d) may reduce additional residual confounding. Note that the relationships depicted in the graph are cross-sectional and therefore static, and they do not illustrate the complex time-dependent effects that may be at play. For example, current general health status was assumed in the graph to affect time outdoors and thereby pollution exposure, but pollution exposure (and its antecedents) in the more distant past are likely to have affected general health status over time. Similarly, in some circumstances air pollution levels influence the amount of time that people choose to spend outdoors, and reversing this arrow in the graph would alter the implications for covariate adjustment.

Sensitivity analyses showed slightly stronger associations when linkage using an alternative source of air pollutant data took account of participants’ address history. Follow-up analyses of cognitive change scores did not detect any association between pollutant exposure and magnitude of score change; the precision of these results was reduced as a consequence of the smaller sample size, thus decreasing the power to detect small associations reliably.

The air pollution measures were also taken from different years, up to five years prior to cognitive assessment. The cognitive tests were brief and were subject to measurement error; the previously-noted low reliability of some of the tests (e.g. pairs matching test-retest correlation <0.2)39 is likely to have biased the change score analyses towards the null, particularly in the relatively short follow-up duration studied here. It is possible to conduct joint analyses of the cognitive outcome measures using latent factors or multivariate modelling (e.g. canonical correlation analysis), which would address the problem of low reliability of individual measures, but this would also reduce the ability to detect any domain-specific relationships that may exist, e.g. affecting memory tasks only. The temporal order of some of the measures was unclear: despite the restrictions imposed on the timing of the pollution measures relative to the date of the baseline cognitive assessment, it was not possible to tell when participants’ cognitive performance reached the level at which it was measured at baseline, because no premorbid cognitive estimates were available. It is therefore possible that cognitive decline had occurred prior to the study period, which in turn may or may not have been causally linked to air pollution exposure at an earlier age.

IntroductionInsomnia is defined as persistent difficulties with sleep initi-ation and/or maintenance, resulting in significant impairment todaytime functioning. At the symptom level, insomnia affects up toone-third of the adult population, while persistent insomnia af-fects approximately 10e12% and is associated with increased riskfor cardiovascular disease, depression, and early mortality[1,2].Both daytime functioning and quality of life are known to beseverely affected in those with insomnia and often drive treat-ment seeking[3e5].Morespecifically, previous work shows thatthe most commonly cited areas of daytime dysfunction areproblems with fatigue, work performance, cognitive perfor-mance, and emotion regulation[6]. Insomnia has also beenassociated with a range of serious and non-serious sleep-relatedaccidents[7].While experimental sleep loss engenders reliable cognitiveimpairment, particularly for vigilance, complex attention, andworking memory[8], there has been comparatively little work oninsomnia. In general, thefield has been characterised by mixedfindings, with some studies showing impairment and othersfailing to observe differences from controls[9]. Nevertheless,meta-analytic data suggest thatpatients exhibit reliable im-pairments in tasks probing episodic memory, working memory,and  problem  solving,  with  small-to-medium  effect  sizes[10].

Sleep-related variablesand cognitive performance were assessed in a single visit thatlasted approximately 90 min.2.3. Sleep-related variablesTo assess insomnia symptoms, participants were asked‘Do youhave trouble falling asleep at night or do you wake up in themiddle of the night?’with responses‘never/rarely’,‘sometimes’and‘usually’. Participants were categorised as having frequentinsomnia symptoms if they answered‘usually’to this question,while the remaining participants made up the control groupwithout frequent insomnia symptoms. Chronotype was assessedusing the following question:‘Do you consider yourself to be’...:‘definitely a“morning”person’,‘more a“morning”than“evening”person’,‘more an“evening”than“morning”person’,‘definitely an“evening”person’. For the purposes of the present study, wecollapsed the two middle responses into an‘intermediate’chro-notype category, permitting comparisons with the‘definitelymorning’and‘definitely evening’groups. Sleep duration wasrecorded as the number of reported hours to the following ques-tion:‘About how many hours sleep do you get in every 24 h? (include naps)’. Given previously established U-shape relationshipswith health and cognition[20], we categorised sleep duration intoshort (<7 h), normal (7e9h)andlong(>9 h) based on recentguidelines[21].2.4. Cognitive performanceFive cognitive measures were administered through a compu-terised touchscreen interface[22]. Time to complete allfivecognitive tests was approximately 15 min. The tests were designedspecifically for the UK Biobank to allow administration at scalewithout examiner supervision. The tasks show evidence of an un-derlying performance factor and good stability over time, with theexception of visual memory performance, which has a compara-tively lower intraclass correlation coefficient[22]. Thefive tasks involved the following instructions:Reasoning: This task assessed the ability to solve 13 verbal andnumeric reasoning problems. Each problem hadfive possibleresponse options. The dependent variable was the total numberof correct answers given (range 0e13) within a 2-min period,with higher scores indicating better performance.Basic reaction time: This task was delivered in the style of thecard game,‘snap’, and requested participants to respond with abutton press when they detected the appearance of a matchingpair of symbols. The dependent variable was the mean responsetime in milliseconds across 12 matching-pair trials. RT valueswere log-transformed because of skewed distribution (ln x).Numeric short-term memory: In this task, a string of numberswas presented on the screen, which subsequently disappeared.Participants were then asked to enter the number string frommemory, in the reverse order, through a keypad. The dependentvariable was the maximum string length recalled correctly(range: 0e12), with higher scores indicating better perfor-mance. The test was discontinued afterfive successive incorrectresponses at string length¼2.Visual memory: In this task, six card pairs of symbols were pre-sented on-screen in a random pattern. Cards were then turnedface down on the screen, and participants were asked to locate asmany symbol pairs as possible in as few attempts as possible. Thedependent variable was the number of errors made during pairsmatching (range 0e146), which was log-transformed because ofskewed distribution and zero inflation (ln (xþ1)).Prospective memory: In this task, participants were asked toremember to perform a pre-planned instruction. Specifically, atthe beginning of the test battery, they were presented with thefollowing instruction:‘At the end of the games we will show youfour coloured symbols and ask you to touch the blue square.However, to test your memory, we want you to actually touch theorange circle instead’. If participants remembered to touch theorange circle onfirst attempt, they were coded as‘correct’(1),while those failing to do so were set to 0.2.5. Demographic dataDemographic data included age, sex, and neighbourhood-levelsocioeconomic status as measured by the Townsend index of ma-terial deprivation. For statistical analyses, socioeconomic status waslog-transformed because of skewed distribution by using an‘ln(xþ7)’equation (minimum of non-transformed index:6.26).Educational qualifications were recorded and were dichotomisedaccording to whether participants held a college/university degree.We also included body mass index (BMI) as a covariate in adjustedanalyses.2.6. Medication and clinical dataCurrent medications were self-reported to the research nurse,and the participants were dichotomised according to whether theywere taking sleep medication (sedatives and hypnotics), any otherpsychotropic medication (mood stabilisers, antidepressants, andantipsychotics) or antihypertensive medication (ACE inhibitors,angiotensin II antagonists, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers,and diuretics). Current depressive symptoms were assessed usingthe following question:‘Over the past two weeks, how often haveyou felt down, depressed or hopeless?’, with the followingresponse options:‘not at all’,‘several days’,‘more than half thedays’or‘nearly every day’. For the purpose of the present analyses,those scoring‘several days’,‘more than half the days’or‘nearlyevery day’were coded in the‘depressive symptoms’category, whilethose scoring‘not at all’were considered in the‘no depressivesymptoms’category. In addition, participants were dichotomisedaccording to whether they reported hypertension or any cardio-vascular disease.2.7. AnalysesDescriptive data presentation included mean values and stan-dard deviations and the proportion of the sample reporting specificquestionnaire response options. Questionnaire response options,‘do not know’or‘prefer not to answer’, were handled as missingvalues. For cognitive dependent variables, the sample size variedacross tests because the reasoning and prospective memory testswere added after the commencement of data collection, while thenumeric memory task was included from the outset but subse-quently removed because of time constraints.In afirst step (unadjusted analyses, model 1), the associationbetween insomnia status (those with frequent insomnia symptomsvs. those without frequent insomnia symptoms) and cognitiveperformance was analysed using four linear models, with insomniastatus as the single predictor variable and reasoning, basic reactiontime, numeric memory, and visual memory as dependent variables.The association between insomnia status and prospective memoryperformance was investigated using a logistic model. In a secondstep (model 2), age, sex, socioeconomic status, and education wereadded as covariates in the linear and logistic models described inmodel 1. In a third step (model 3), chronotype (with the interme-diate type as the reference category), sleep medication use, BMI as acontinuous variable, hypertension, antihypertensive medication,cardiovascular disease, depressive symptoms, and psychotropicmedication were added as further covariates. In afinal step (model4), sleep duration (with 7e9 h as the reference category) wasinserted as an additional predictor of cognitive performance. Wetherefore report unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted relation-ships between insomnia status and cognitive outcomes. For chro-notype, sleep duration and sleep medication, we report only thefully adjusted relationships (model 4) controlling for all de-mographic, clinical and remaining sleep variables.

First, this was a cross-sectional study and therefore ourfindings cannot elucidate cau-sality. Second, our cognitive dependent variables were created forbrief completion on large numbers of participants and hence havenot undergone formal validation. In partial mitigation, principalcomponent analyses support an expected underlying performance(g) factor across tasks, and test-retest suggests good stability formost task-dependent variables[22]. Moreover, associations withvariables in the expected direction (eg, with age and education),evidence of impairment in those with psychiatric disorder[24]andassociations with several genetic variants[49]provide furthersupport of task validity. However, tasks were brief and did notparametrically manipulate cognitive load, and the battery did notsample additional domains of cognition, potentially contributing tolimited sensitivity for insomnia-related impairment. Third, oursleep trait predictor variables were limited by their low resolution,reflecting just single item self-report questions. For example, oursleep duration estimate included daytime naps and therefore wecould not separate the contribution of night and daytime sleep,which may have affected group categorisation and, by extension,associations with our dependent variables of interest. We could notinvestigate subtypes of insomnia that may have unique relation-ships with cognitive impairment[16]. Specifically, we could notcategorise participants into insomnia disorder because we lackedinformation on chronicity of sleep problems, quantitative criteria(eg, minutes for sleep-onset latency and wake-time during thenight), attribution for daytime cognitive impairment or help-seeking. Greater precision around these factors and objectivesleep data may have identified sub-groups of participants withcognitive impairment[12,15,18,30,50]. Our results therefore canonly speak to frequent insomnia symptoms at the population level.Fourth, our sample age was restricted to those predominantly inthe middle age. It may be that insomnia confers the greatest risk tocognitive impairment in elderly samples[23]. Fifth, while the UKBiobank represents a large and unique resource, the recruitmentmethod and low response rate (5.5%) may have resulted in selectionbiases, potentially limiting generalisability to the broader UK pop-ulation[51].

Statistically significant associations between depression and presence/extent of chronic pain persisted following adjustment for potential confounding variables; this relationship was strongest for Black participants (presence of chronic pain: OR 1.86 (1.52, 2.27); RRR 1 site 1.49 (1.16, 1.91), 2–3 sites 1.98 (1.53, 2.56), 4–7 sites 3.23 (2.09, 4.99), pain all over the body 3.31 (2.05, 5.33). When current depressive symptoms were considered these relationships were attenuated.  Conclusions Chronic pain and depression reporting varies across ethnic groups. Differences in health seeking behaviour between ethnic groups may impact on the results reported. Clinicians, particularly in primary care, need to be aware of the cultural barriers within certain ethic groups to expressing concern over mood and to consider their approach accordingly.""",Yes,"""Background Chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression are common, complex disorders that are challenging to treat and manage in primary care. They often co-occur and long-standing debate has surrounded the temporal nature of the relationship between chronic pain and depression and on the causes and consequences of this relationship [1]. Factors affecting the presentation and management of symptoms are wide-ranging and will involve a combination of demographic, personal, lifestyle, environmental and social elements.  Population-based studies have shown that self-reported musculoskeletal pain is more prevalent among ethnic minority groups in the UK, particularly widespread pain at multiple sites of the body [2–4]. In the US, the prevalence of self-reported pain is higher in Hispanic and Black ethnic groups than non-Hispanic White individuals [5]; however, this difference was not apparent after adjusting for potential confounders such as sociodemographic status, comorbidity, and psychological distress. Minority ethnic groups in US pain clinic populations have also reported more severe or disabling pain than the non-Hispanic White population in the US [6, 7]. Recent studies in the US have focused on trying to better explain the racial and ethnic disparities in pain treatment and management, and suggest that access to healthcare, and patient attitudes and behaviours may play a role in explaining some of the disparities observed [8–10]. Similarly, ethnic minority groups have also been reported to be less likely to seek professional help for mood problems [11] yet the prevalence of depression is reported to be higher in these groups in the UK than in the majority White ethnic group [12, 13].  Few studies have specifically considered the comorbidity of chronic pain and depression across ethnic groups, rather ethnicity has been considered as a covariate in the relationship between pain and depression or as a predictor of pain and depression [14]. In a study of 866 participants, Miller and Cano (2009) found that African Americans were almost twice as likely to have comorbid depression and pain as Caucasian Americans, relative to those with no pain or depression [15]. However, it is unclear whether similar patterns would be observed amongst other ethnic groups and whether the relationship between depression and pain is similar in US and UK ethnic groups.  Chronic pain and depression have also been shown to be some of the most common comorbidities in individuals with other physical and mental long-term conditions [16–18]. Given the ethnic [19, 20] and sociodemographic [16] gradient evident in the pattern of long-term condition reporting it is important to study the relationship between socioeconomic status, ethnicity, pain, and depression independently of other physical long-term conditions, and furthermore understand whether a history of depression or current depressive symptoms are more important. Developing an understanding of these relationships has the potential to impact on how health professionals manage chronic pain in primary care, particularly for ethnic minority groups that may be less likely to present with their low mood problems.""",Yes,"""Chronic pain and depression have also been shown to be some of the most common comorbidities in individuals with other physical and mental long-term conditions [16–18].

Multiple sites could be selected, unless participants reported “pain all over the body”. For all sites selected a subsequent question asked whether the pain had been present for more than three months. Chronic pain was defined as pain that had persisted for more than three months. The presence of chronic pain was classified if participants reported any site of chronic pain; those reporting no sites of chronic pain were classified as being free of chronic pain. The extent of chronic pain was calculated by summing the number of sites of chronic pain reported and the following categories were defined: free of chronic pain; chronic pain at one site; chronic pain at 2–3 sites; chronic pain at 4–7 sites; and “pain all over the body”.

Using the touch screen questionnaire, participants answered questions regarding their past history of mood disorder symptoms and related medical help-seeking, which were similar to questions within the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders [24]. Probable major depressive disorder included participants that we classified as having a lifetime history of recurrent severe, recurrent moderate or single episode depression; the criteria for these definitions are outlined in Fig. 1. Current depressive symptom score was calculated from four individual questions that assessed the frequency of the following depression symptoms “over the past 2 weeks”: depressed mood, unenthusiasm/disinterest, tenseness/restlessness, and tiredness/lethargy. Questions were answered on a four point scale: not at all; several days; more than half the days; and nearly every day.

Classification of chronic pain Within UK Biobank, participants were asked whether they had experienced pain in the past month that interfered with their usual activities, in any of the following sites: headache, facial, neck or shoulder, back, stomach or abdominal, hip, and knee; and an eighth option of “pain all over the body”. Multiple sites could be selected, unless participants reported “pain all over the body”. For all sites selected a subsequent question asked whether the pain had been present for more than three months. Chronic pain was defined as pain that had persisted for more than three months. The presence of chronic pain was classified if participants reported any site of chronic pain; those reporting no sites of chronic pain were classified as being free of chronic pain. The extent of chronic pain was calculated by summing the number of sites of chronic pain reported and the following categories were defined: free of chronic pain; chronic pain at one site; chronic pain at 2–3 sites; chronic pain at 4–7 sites; and “pain all over the body”. This classification of number of pain sites has previously been reported [22].  Classification of depression The definition of probable lifetime depression history among UK Biobank participants has been described in detail previously [23]. Using the touch screen questionnaire, participants answered questions regarding their past history of mood disorder symptoms and related medical help-seeking, which were similar to questions within the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders [24]. Probable major depressive disorder included participants that we classified as having a lifetime history of recurrent severe, recurrent moderate or single episode depression; the criteria for these definitions are outlined in Fig. 1.

To quantify the association between depression and the presence of chronic pain, logistic regression models were used; results are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals. To quantify the association between depression and the extent of chronic pain reported, multinomial logistic regression models were used; results are presented as relative risk ratios (RRR) and 95 % confidence intervals.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the associations of screen time with cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality were modified by levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, grip strength or physical activity.  Methods In total, 390,089 participants (54% women) from the UK Biobank were included in this study. All-cause mortality, CVD and cancer incidence and mortality were the main outcomes. Discretionary television (TV) viewing, personal computer (PC) screen time and overall screen time (TV + PC time) were the exposure variables. Grip strength, fitness and physical activity were treated as potential effect modifiers.""",Yes,"""Results Altogether, 7420 participants died, and there were 22,210 CVD events, over a median of 5.0 years follow-up (interquartile range 4.3 to 5.7; after exclusion of the first 2 years from baseline in the landmark analysis). All discretionary screen-time exposures were significantly associated with all health outcomes. The associations of overall discretionary screen time with all-cause mortality and incidence of CVD and cancer were strongest amongst participants in the lowest tertile for grip strength (all-cause mortality hazard ratio per 2-h increase in screen time (1.31 [95% confidence interval: 1.22–1.43], p < 0.0001; CVD 1.21 [1.13–1.30], p = 0.0001; cancer incidence 1.14 [1.10–1.19], p < 0.0001) and weakest amongst those in the highest grip-strength tertile (all-cause mortality 1.04 [0.95–1.14], p = 0.198; CVD 1.05 [0.99–1.11], p = 0.070; cancer 0.98 [0.93–1.05], p = 0.771). Similar trends were found for fitness (lowest fitness tertile: all-cause mortality 1.23 [1.13–1.34], p = 0.002 and CVD 1.10 [1.02–1.22], p = 0.010; highest fitness tertile: all-cause mortality 1.12 [0.96–1.28], p = 0.848 and CVD 1.01 [0.96–1.07], p = 0.570). Similar findings were found for physical activity for all-cause mortality and cancer incidence.  Conclusions The associations between discretionary screen time and adverse health outcomes were strongest in those with low grip strength, fitness and physical activity and markedly attenuated in those with the highest levels of grip strength, fitness and physical activity. Thus, if these associations are causal, the greatest benefits from health promotion interventions to reduce discretionary screen time may be seen in those with low levels of strength, fitness and physical activity.""",Yes,"""Low levels of physical activity [1] and high levels of sedentary behaviour (overall sitting and discretionary television viewing and computer use) [2,3,4] both have strong associations with a number of adverse health outcomes, including mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is also strong evidence that low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness [5] and muscular strength [6,7,8,9] are associated with similar adverse health outcomes. It has been suggested that the associations of physical activity and sedentary behaviour with health outcomes are largely independent [1, 2, 10]. However, a recent meta-analysis indicated that the adverse effects of sitting time and television (TV) viewing on mortality were not observed in individuals with high levels of physical activity [10]. This observation indicates that the risks associated with sedentary behaviour are not ubiquitous, since individuals with low physical activity experience the greatest adverse effects. Using data from UK Biobank, which includes almost 500,000 participants with data on grip strength and over 60,000 participants with data on cardiorespiratory fitness, we recently reported that the adverse association of low levels of physical activity with mortality and CVD events are substantially stronger in individuals with low levels of grip strength and/or cardiorespiratory fitness. This impies that the benefits of physical activity may be greatest amongst individuals with lower levels of functional capacity, but relatively modest in those with already high levels of functional capacity, who were at low risk irrespective of physical activity levels [9]. This has implications for public health guidance, as it suggests that specifically targeting those with low fitness and strength to increase their physical activity levels may be an effective approach to reduce population risk [9]. We hypothesised that a similar pattern would be evident for discretionary screen-time behaviours such as TV viewing and personal computer (PC) screen time, with the adverse effects of high levels of screen time being greatest in those with low levels of strength, fitness and physical activity [10].""",Yes,""" Using data from UK Biobank, which includes almost 500,000 participants with data on grip strength and over 60,000 participants with data on cardiorespiratory fitness, we recently reported that the adverse association of low levels of physical activity with mortality and CVD events are substantially stronger in individuals with low levels of grip strength and/or cardiorespiratory fitness.

Participants were excluded from the analyses if they recorded implausible values, that is, if the sum of their total physical activity, sleeping time and total screen time exceeded 24 h (n = 705 participants were excluded) [9].  Grip strength was assessed using a Jamar J00105 hydraulic hand dynamometer and the mean of three measurements for each hand were used. Grip strength was measured in kilograms. Fitness test data were introduced into UK Biobank from August 2009, so these data are available only in a subgroup of 74,836 participants. In these individuals, cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using a sub-maximal 6-min incremental ramp cycle ergometer test with workload calculated according to age, height, weight, resting heart rate and sex, and heart rate monitored via a four-lead electrocardiogram, as previously reported, with the aim of achieving a final work rate of 50% of predicted maximal power [9]. Tests were terminated if heart rate exceeded 75% of the age-predicted maximum. In individuals with systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 109 mmHg or who answered ‘yes’ or ‘unsure’ to the question ‘Has a doctor ever said that you have a heart condition and should only do physical activity recommended by a doctor’, the test protocol was modified to achieve a final work rate of 35% of predicted maximal power (n = 8932).

The work rate at maximal heart rate was estimated by extrapolating the pre-exercise heart rate (i.e. at work rate zero watts) and the heart rate and work rate at the end of the test to the age-predicted maximal heart rate (208 – 0.7 × age) [18] assuming a linear relationship [19]. The linear nature of the work rate vs heart rate relationship means that the estimated maximal work rate for an individual should be independent of the work rate achieved during the exercise test. Maximal oxygen uptake (i.e. at maximal heart rate) was estimated from the regression equation for the relationship between work rate and oxygen uptake (oxygen uptake (in ml.kg− 1.min− 1) = 7 + (10.8 × work rate (in watts))/body mass (in kilograms)) [20] and then expressed in terms of maximal MET (where 1 MET ≡ 3.5 ml.kg− 1.min− 1).

Analyses were performed for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality and CVD and cancer incidence (fatal and non-fatal combined) and mortality. All analyses were performed as a landmark analysis with follow-up commenced 2 years after recruitment and including participants who were event-free at this time. In addition, participants with comorbidities (depression, COPD, chronic asthma, chronic liver diseases, alcohol problems, substance abuse, eating disorders, schizophrenia, cognitive impartment, Parkinson, dementia, chronic pain syndrome, heart diseases and cancer) at baseline were excluded from all analyses (n = 103,755).  Firstly, the durations of discretionary screen time, TV viewing and PC screen time in hours per day were treated as continuous variables and hazard ratios (HR) were calculated per 1-h increment. Linearity was explored with fractional polynomial models for each exposure, with no evidence for deviation from linearity. Each exposure was rounded to the nearest hour. Multiplicative interactions between the screen-time exposures and sex were investigated by fitting the relevant parameters into the model. For these analyses, we ran four incremental models that included an increasing number of covariates. Model 0 included age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation index, professional qualifications, income and employment as covariates. Model 1 was adjusted for lifestyle factors including smoking, physical activity, grip strength, categories of sleep duration, dietary intake (alcohol, fruit and vegetables, red meat, processed meat and oily fish intake). Model 2 was adjusted for model 1 plus BMI categories. Model 3 was adjusted for model 2 plus systolic blood pressure, prevalent diabetes, hypertension and medication for diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol.

Our results revealed that, overall, higher levels of screen time were associated with a higher hazard for all-cause mortality and CVD and cancer incidence and mortality, independent of physical activity, grip strength, BMI and other major confounding factors. However, when the cohort was stratified by grip strength, the HRs for mortality, CVD and cancer associated with increasing screen time were almost twice as strong in those with low compared with high levels of grip strength. A similar pattern was observed for physical activity. For cardiorespiratory fitness, the association of increasing screen time with increasing risk for mortality, CVD and cancer was augmented in the least fit population tertile. If these associations are causal, this suggests that the population subgroups with the lowest levels of strength, fitness and physical activity could potentially obtain the greatest benefit from interventions aimed at reducing sedentary behaviours. Conversely, in those with high strength, fitness and physical activity, the adverse effects of prolonged discretionary screen time were attenuated.  Although this study used overall discretionary screen time as one of the exposures of interest, our study also confirms the direction and magnitude of the association of TV viewing and leisure PC screen time with health outcomes [3, 4].""",Yes,"""Fitness was only assessed in a subgroup of the UK Biobank cohort, which limits the power in our analyses stratified by fitness level. In addition, fitness tests were not conducted if it was unsafe to do so and our analyses excluded all participants with comorbidities. It might be expected that such individuals would be more likely to have a low rather than high level of fitness, thus their inclusion could conceivably have obscured or augmented the true association between fitness and the outcome measures due to reverse causality. UK Biobank is relatively representative of the general population with respect to age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation within the age range recruited but is not representative in other regards, such as prevalence of obesity and comorbidities, which may indicate a healthy volunteer selection bias [37]. Whilst this limits the ability to generalise prevalence rates, estimates of the magnitude of associations regarding disease or mortality and disease risk in the current study should nevertheless be generalisable [13, 37, 38]. As is the case for any observational study, causality cannot be confirmed and reverse causality is always a possibility. However, our analyses were conducted by excluding all those with chronic conditions. Although disease and comorbidities existing before the UK Biobank measurement day were self-reported, these self-reported records were based on diseases that have been medically diagnosed. Additionally, we excluded those who died within the first 2 years of follow-up. These approaches help us to minimise the risk of reverse causality influencing our estimates. Another aspect that could confound our findings is the effect of potential mediators, such as BMI, diabetes and hypertension, on the health outcomes. However, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by testing the interaction between health outcomes and screen-time exposures with and without these covariates and the results were not altered. Therefore, we included only a fully adjusted analysis in the study.

However, most self-reported instruments have similar validity [40], and the effect estimates reported for screen time in this study were similar to those reported previously in comparable populations using similar adjustment strategies [3, 4, 41]. Misreporting of screen time or physical activity may have attenuated the association between the lifestyle exposures and mortality compared to an objective physical activity measurement [42]. However, this is unlikely to have substantially confounded the differential influence of the exposures on mortality and disease risk across the screen-time or physical activity groups, unless the extent of misreporting of screen time was systematically greater in the groups with the highest levels of physical activity, fitness and grip strength. It is also more feasible to administer a questionnaire rather than an objective measure as a screening tool in routine clinical or community settings [26] to identify individuals for whom increasing physical activity and reducing screen time would be particularly beneficial.

We also confirm and extend recent observations that the association between TV viewing and mortality is attenuated by a level of physical activity. This has two potentially important implications for public health. First, interventions to reduce discretionary sedentary behaviours to improve future health outcomes may be more economically and clinically effective if they are targeted at those with low levels of strength, fitness and physical activity. Second, increasing strength and fitness may provide a means of offsetting the potential adverse consequences of high screen time.

Data were collected about demographics, physical activity, iRMDs (RA, PsA, AS, SLE) and other chronic conditions, including angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, pulmonary disease, diabetes and depression.

The most prevalent inflammatory RMDs are RA, PsA, AS and SLE, with estimated prevalence rates in European adults of 0.8% [3], 0.2% [4], 0.11% [5] and 97 cases per 100 000 population (0.1%) [6], respectively. Patients with these diseases have an increased risk of co-morbid conditions compared with the general population [7, 8], partly explained by the chronic inflammation. Most notably, the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease is increased in people with inflammatory RMDs, and accounts for >40% of premature deaths [9–15]. Pulmonary disease [12, 13, 15–17], diabetes [13, 14] and depression [13, 15] are also more common in people with inflammatory RMDs. However, most studies investigating the prevalence of co-morbidities in people with inflammatory RMDs have been undertaken in disease-specific cohorts, and prevalence estimates of co-morbidities vary considerably between studies, partly due to differences in study design, population characteristics and disease ascertainment.  In a nested case–control study using primary care data from the Netherlands [7], patients with inflammatory arthritis were more likely to have cardiovascular disease (odds ratio (OR) 1.4, 95% CI 1.2, 1.5), respiratory disease (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3, 1.8) and depression (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0, 1.4), compared with age- and sex-matched controls without inflammatory arthritis. To gain a better understanding of multimorbidity in general populations, it is important to estimate rates of morbidity in one population using consistent methods for disease ascertainment.  Physical activity has many benefits for patients with inflammatory RMDs, including reducing disease activity and pain, increasing functional capacity and improving psychological health [18, 19], as well as potentially reducing the incidence of some co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoporosis [20]. There is some evidence that patients with inflammatory RMDs are less physically active than the general population [21–23]. However, the relationship between co-morbid diseases and physical activity in patients with different inflammatory RMDs has not been explored in detail.

Morbidities were coded in the UK Biobank database using a hierarchical structure loosely based on International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) codes [30].  All data were collected at the UK Biobank baseline assessment. Participants were asked to self-report the age/year of diagnosis of their inflammatory RMD and/or co-morbidities. The retrospective, self-reported date of diagnosis of inflammatory RMD and co-morbidities was used to identify incident cases of co-morbidity occurring after the diagnosis of one of the inflammatory RMDs, and also the time (years) between the diagnosis of the inflammatory RMD and the diagnosis of the co-morbidity. Incident co-morbidities could not be identified for ∼1% of participants with an inflammatory RMD due to missing data. To assess the association between co-morbidities and physical activity, a modified functional co-morbidity index [31, 32] was calculated for each participant using self-reported morbidities. The functional co-morbidity index was developed by identifying co-morbidities that correlate with the physical function subscale of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) [31] (see Supplementary data, section Construction of the functional co-morbidity index, available at Rheumatology online).

The retrospective, self-reported date of diagnosis of inflammatory RMD and co-morbidities was used to identify incident cases of co-morbidity occurring after the diagnosis of one of the inflammatory RMDs, and also the time (years) between the diagnosis of the inflammatory RMD and the diagnosis of the co-morbidity. Incident co-morbidities could not be identified for ∼1% of participants with an inflammatory RMD due to missing data. To assess the association between co-morbidities and physical activity, a modified functional co-morbidity index [31, 32] was calculated for each participant using self-reported morbidities. The functional co-morbidity index was developed by identifying co-morbidities that correlate with the physical function subscale of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) [31] (see Supplementary data, section Construction of the functional co-morbidity index, available at Rheumatology online). Furthermore, we classified each participant into one of four study groups, depending on whether they had any one of the four inflammatory RMDs being studied and whether their functional co-morbidity index was >0.  Identifying participants with inflammatory RMDS Participants answering yes to the question ‘Has a doctor ever told you that you have had any other serious medical conditions or disabilities?’ were asked the following question during the interview: ‘in the touch-screen questionnaire, you selected that you have been told by a doctor that you have other serious illnesses or disabilities. Could you now tell me what they are?’ Conditions were selected from a pre-specified list, including RA, PsA, AS and SLE, or entered as free text if they did not exist in the pre-specified list. Participants also reported their age at the time of diagnosis or the year of diagnosis. Participants who did not answer whether they had a chronic medical condition, who reported having non-specified arthritis, or who reported having more than one of the four inflammatory RMDs considered were excluded from the analyses (Supplementary Fig. S1, available at Rheumatology online).  Medication During the interview, details of medications being used at the time of the assessment were recorded by the research nurse, by selecting the drug name from a pre-specified list. Medications not included in the pre-specified list were entered as free text. We developed an algorithm to code free text medication data (see Supplementary data, section Coding free text medication, available at Rheumatology online).

Social and environmental correlates of AC will also be explored.  Design Cross-sectional analysis of a cohort study.  Settings This is a population cohort of over 500 000 people recruited from 22 centres across the UK. Participants aged between 37 and 73 years were recruited between 2006 and 2010.  Participants 6896 participants with a self-reported type 2 diabetes diagnosis who reported commuting to work and had complete covariate data were included in the analysis.  Exposure measures Exposure measures were AC to work, measured as usual mode of transport.  Outcome measures Outcome measures were weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), hours/day of sedentary time and participation in active travel.""",Yes,"""Results AC (reporting walking or cycling to work only) was reported by 5.5% of participants, with the great majority using the car to commute (80%). AC was associated with an additional 73 (95% CI 10.8 to 134.9) and 105 (95% CI 41.7 to 167.2) weekly minutes of MVPA for men and women, respectively. AC was associated with reduced sedentary time (β −1.1, 95% CI −1.6 to –0.7 hours/day for men; and β −0.8, 95% CI −1.2 to –0.3 hours/day for women). Deprivation and distance from home to work were identified as correlates of AC behaviour.  Conclusions Rates of AC are very low in adults with type 2 diabetes. However, AC offers a potentially sustainable solution to increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour. Therefore, strategies to improve the environment and encourage AC may help to increase population levels of physical activity and reduce the disease burden associated with type 2 diabetes.""",Yes,"""Introduction Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a disease associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, such as poor diet and physical inactivity,1 and displays a social gradient.2 The worldwide age-standardised prevalence of T2DM has doubled to 8.5% since 1980.3 In the UK the prevalence is 6%, and the ongoing treatment and management burden of T2DM and its associated complications place a considerable burden on the National Health Service.4 5  The role of physical activity (PA) in the prevention and management of T2DM is well understood.6 However, fewer adults with T2DM achieve UK Government recommendations of at least 150 min moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week,7 and many interventions fail to achieve increases in PA sufficient to confer metabolic benefits.7–9 Sedentary behaviour is also an independent risk factor for the development of T2DM.10 Cross-sectional evidence from UK Biobank suggests that adults with T2DM are characterised by a phenotype of unhealthy behaviours, including prolonged sedentary time, physical inactivity and poor sleep, suggesting that these behaviours should be targeted in parallel.11  The role of active commuting (AC) in increasing PA and controlling excessive weight gain has been recognised and endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.12 AC has the potential to increase individuals’ PA and reduce sedentary time, and more widely to lower levels of traffic congestion and noise and air pollution,13 and can be sustainably incorporated into daily living.14 However, rates of AC are low in the UK. In the 2011 census, of the 58% of adults who responded to the question ‘how do you usually travel to work? 67% reported private motorised transport as the principal mode of transport, 17.8% public transport, 10.9% walking and 3.1% commuting by bicycle.15  There is increasing evidence of an association between AC and measures of obesity.16 17 In the UK Understanding Society cohort, AC has been shown to be predictive of lower body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage, and a lower adjusted odds of reporting a diabetes diagnosis compared with car users.16 18 Similarly in UK Biobank, AC was significantly and independently associated with lower BMI and body fat percentage.17 The protective effect of AC is likely to be mediated through increased PA, as demonstrated in a UK study that used accelerometry and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to show that walking to work contributed 47.3% of daily MVPA.19  Causal evidence from longitudinal or experimental studies is rare. A longitudinal analysis of the UK Biobank cohort looked at changes in BMI in response to changes in commuting mode over a 4-year follow-up. Individuals who transitioned from car commuting at baseline to active or public transportation modes at follow-up had a decrease in BMI of −0.30 kg/m2 (95% CI −0.47 to –0.13).20  Promoting AC may help to increase population levels of activity; however, there is a need to understand the correlates of AC to develop appropriate interventions. Some key determinants of commuter cycling and walking behaviour have been identified as high population density, dedicated cycling paths, short trip distances and good traffic and road conditions, such as the presence of traffic calming measures.21 22 Most work to date has been performed in healthy adults, and there is a need to understand how these findings relate to populations with T2DM who are characterised by obesity and physical inactivity.""",Yes,"""Promoting AC may help to increase population levels of activity; however, there is a need to understand the correlates of AC to develop appropriate interventions.

Therefore, participants who have an address more than 400 km from this site were not assigned a value for PM2.5–10. Traffic variables, including inverse distance to a major road and traffic density, were also calculated using the LUR model, based on Eurostreets (V.3.1) digital road network for the year 2008. Traffic density is measured as the average total number of motor vehicles per 24 hours on the nearest road. These correlates were selected on the basis that they were available on an individual level and may help to inform further analysis of environmental correlates of commuting behaviour.  Covariates A range of confounding variables were considered. Socioeconomic covariates were Townsend Deprivation Index of residential area, annual gross household income and highest educational qualification. Further demographic covariates were age (years), sex, ethnicity and census-derived residential area population density classification (urban/fringe, rural). The potential confounding effects of occupational PA were considered: job involves standing/walking; job involves heavy manual/physical work; shift work; non-work related transport modes (active modes: yes/no). Health covariates were poor self-rated health (yes/no).

AC was reported by 5.5% of the sample, of whom less than 1% reported cycling. AC was strongly and consistently associated with higher PA, whether expressed as MVPA or total MET-min/week. In fully adjusted models, AC was associated with an additional 73 min/week of MVPA for men and 105 min/week of MVPA for women, making a substantial contribution to meeting the UK Government recommended levels of 150 min/week MVPA.7 This finding supports previous work by Audrey et al, 19 which found levels of PA to be higher in those who walked to work compared with those who did not. Furthermore the association with MVPA seen in the present study is substantially larger than achieved in a similar population undergoing an intensive PA intervention,8 suggesting that adoption of AC could be an effective intervention for people with T2D.  The importance of sedentary time for both prevention and management of type 2 diabetes has gained research prominence in recent years,31 32 and we found a substantial association between AC and lower sedentary time. In both sexes both AC and public and mixed modes of transport were associated with over an hour less sedentary time per day compared with car use. Since adults with T2DM typically spend less than 3% of the day engaged in MVPA, interventions that focus on reducing sedentary time may be more effective to improve health33; reallocating 30 min of prolonged sedentary time to more active pursuits can improve body composition and cholesterol levels in adults with T2DM.34  The predominant correlate of AC was distance to work, with few people who lived over 1.5 miles from their workplace choosing AC and those living in rural areas less likely to actively commute. Although distance from home to work is not modifiable, AC as the whole or part of the journey could be encouraged by providing more cycleways, by road safety measures to limit traffic speed and improving access to parks and green spaces.35 36 We were unable to examine the association of access to transport as a correlate of AC, but it can be hypothesised this would correlate strongly with the transport method chosen. Furthermore, we used a crude measure of AC (walking or cycling only) and were therefore unable to explore the role of AC as a contributor to the overall journey. Individuals who live beyond 3–6 miles from work are unlikely to solely use AC modes to travel to work and are more likely to combine AC with another form of activity, such as the car or public transport. Therefore the role of AC as a component of the overall journey should be explored in future research.  In the current study, the results for public transport were equivocal with no apparent observations with PA observed. This contrasts with previous research17 and may be due to an inability to differentiate between the different types of public transport taken and the public transport category also including people who reported mixed modes of motorised travel and AC. There are likely to be variations in the energy requirements of different transport modes, which should be examined. It could also be hypothesised that walking or activity behaviours associated with public transport are difficult to recall and record in the IPAQ. However, in previous research public transport has been shown to contribute to PA and therefore warrants further investigation.  The final aim of the study was to explore the social and environmental correlates of AC behaviour. Those who lived in a rural area were less likely to use active modes of commuting, but no other environmental variables, such as traffic density, were shown to be associated. This may be due to an overall lack of variation in the environmental variables and suggests a more diverse sample may be required. For example, there is a lack of interindividual variation in the measure of air pollution, which may explain the lack of association seen""",Yes,"""The study also has some important limitations. The analyses were cross-sectional and therefore causality cannot be determined. The small numbers of participants reporting AC did not allow walking and cycling to be examined separately. The relative energy demands of these behaviours differ, and previous research has suggested these behaviours are performed by different portions of society.37 The current study was also unable to distinguish between the different modes of public transport. The observed gender difference suggests there may be differences in the work and travel patterns of men and women in this study population. The average distance from home to work was almost twice as far for men, which may explain why more women reported active modes of travel. The study is further limited by self-report measures of PA and sedentary behaviour.""",No,,Partially,"Makes policy recommendation ""In conclusion, AC is associated with increased PA and reduced sedentary time in people with type 2 diabetes. This may have a beneficial effect on glucose control and could contribute towards reduced treatment costs. Strategies to increase AC in adults with T2DM may increase levels of PA, and thus contribute to reducing the burden of this disease.""",Yes,"""The study sample is predominantly of white British ethnicity, which does not reflect the distribution of type 2 diabetes in the UK, limiting the generalisability of the findings. The sample is also limited to those who work, and therefore can only examine the role of AC on PA and sedentary time.

Such studies are required to help elucidate the complex biological and psychological overlap between pain and mood disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between chronic multisite pain and mood disorder across the unipolar-bipolar spectrum.  Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of 149,611 UK Biobank participants. Self-reported depressive and bipolar features were used to categorise participants into MDD and BD groups and a non-mood disordered comparison group. Multinomial logistic regression was used to establish whether there was an association between extent of chronic pain (independent variable) and mood disorder category (dependent variable), using no pain as the referent category, and adjusting for a wide range of potential sociodemographic, lifestyle and comorbidity confounders.""",Yes,"""Results Multisite pain was significantly more prevalent in participants with BD and MDD, for example, 4–7 pain sites: BD 5.8%, MDD 4.5%, and comparison group 1.8% (p < 0.001). A relationship was observed between extent of chronic pain and risk of BD and persisted after adjusting for confounders (relative to individuals with no chronic pain): 2–3 sites RRR of BD 1.84 (95% CI 1.61, 2.11); 4–7 sites RRR of BD 2.39 (95% CI 1.88, 3.03) and widespread pain RRR of BD 2.37 (95% CI 1.73, 3.23). A similar relationship was observed between chronic pain and MDD: 2–3 sites RRR of MDD 1.59 (95% CI 1.54, 1.65); 4–7 sites RRR of MDD 2.13 (95% CI 1.98, 2.30); widespread pain RRR of MDD 1.86 (95% CI 1.66, 2.08).  Conclusions Individuals who report chronic pain and multiple sites of pain are more likely to have MDD and are at higher risk of BD. These findings highlight an important aspect of comorbidity in MDD and BD and may have implications for understanding the shared neurobiology of chronic pain and mood disorders.""",Yes,"""Background Chronic pain is known to be associated with depressive features and major depressive disorder (MDD) [1],[2] but the association between chronic pain and bipolar disorder (BD) has received less attention. Very few studies have investigated associations between chronic multisite pain (pain occurring at two or more body sites [3]) and mood disorders, although there is some evidence of a positive correlation between number of chronic pain sites and depressive features [4].  A study of the health records of 5 million US Veterans Affairs patients found that those with MDD or BD were 1.8 and 2.6 times more likely, respectively, to have a diagnosis of one or more painful conditions in their health records than non-mood disordered controls [5]. The prevalence of chronic pain was reported to be 23.7% in a meta-analysis of chronic pain in BD studies; and patients with BD were found to be at a two-fold increased risk of having chronic pain compared to the general population [6]. Two further studies investigating the association between chronic pain and BD suggested that pain may be under-recognised among individuals with BD. Cerimele and colleagues have reported that in a cohort of primary care patients receiving an intervention for BD 46% were also receiving treatment for pain or experiencing pain that interfered with their daily functioning [7]. In the Singapore Mental Health Study, chronic pain was the most prevalent comorbid physical condition among participants with BD, affecting 40.4% of these individuals [8]. These initial findings support the need for a better understanding of the relationships between chronic pain and mood disorder in order to improve the clinical management of these challenging to treat conditions. Further epidemiological understanding will lead to the development of biological hypotheses that might explain why chronic pain and mood disorder (depression and/or bipolar disorder) commonly co-occur.""",Yes,"""These initial findings support the need for a better understanding of the relationships between chronic pain and mood disorder in order to improve the clinical management of these challenging to treat conditions.

UK Biobank is a large, prospective cohort study of over 500,000 participants recruited from the general population in England, Scotland and Wales [9]. It represents a unique opportunity to investigate associations (and, in future, health outcomes such as onset and prognosis of disease, and shared neurobiological and genetic components) between chronic pain syndromes and mood disorders.

The sociodemographic factors included as covariates were: sex, age (as a continuous variable), ethnic group (defined by UK Biobank as white, black or black British, Asian or Asian British and other (including mixed, Chinese and other ethnic group)), employment status and area-based socioeconomic deprivation. Participants could select more than one option for their current employment status and for this study were categorised into mutually exclusive groups: paid employment/looking after home or family, retired (unless also selected not working due to sickness), unemployed/unpaid, not working due to sickness or disability, and student (if they selected no other category). Area-based socioeconomic status was assessed using the Townsend Index, a score derived from postcode of residence information on unemployment, car ownership, owner occupation and overcrowding [12]. A higher Townsend Index score reflects higher levels of deprivation. The Townsend score was categorised into quintiles based on frequency in this study population: quintile 1 represents the least deprived and quintile 5 the most deprived areas. Lifestyle factors considered as potential confounders included: body mass index (BMI) based on actual weight and height measurements taken at the assessment centre and categorised into: underweight <18.5 kg/m2, normal weight = 18.5-24.9 kg/m2, overweight =25.0-29.9 kg/m2, and obese ≥ 30.0 kg/m2 [13]; smoking status (current, former or never smokers); and frequency of alcohol consumption (daily/almost daily, 3–4 times per week, 1–2 times per week, 1–3 times per month, special occasions only and never). Doctor-diagnosis of cancer was self-reported using the touch screen questionnaire, and details of participants’ other medical conditions were based on self-report during a face to face interview with a trained nurse (UK Biobank field ID 20002).

The risk of a probable mood disorder classification (both MDD and BD) also increased in proportion to the number of sites of chronic pain reported. These findings have implications for our understanding of the neurobiological relationship between chronic pain and mood disorders and, within a clinical context, are relevant because they highlight the importance of an adequate assessment of the nature and extent of pain in patients with BD or MDD.

Methods This cross‐sectional study used baseline data from the UK Biobank study on 418 656 white European, black and South‐Asian participants, aged 40–69 years, who had complete data on diabetes status and hand‐grip strength. Associations between hand‐grip strength and diabetes were assessed using logistic regression and were adjusted for potential confounding factors.""",Yes,"""Results Lower grip strength was associated with higher prevalence of diabetes, independent of confounding factors, across all ethnicities in both men and women. Diabetes prevalence was approximately three‐ to fourfold higher in South‐Asian and two‐ to threefold higher in black participants compared with white European participants across all levels of grip strength, but grip strength in South‐Asian men and women was ~ 5–6 kg lower than in the other ethnic groups. Thus, the attributable risk for diabetes associated with low grip strength was substantially higher in South‐Asian participants (3.9 and 4.2 cases per 100 men and women, respectively) than in white participants (2.0 and 0.6 cases per 100 men and women, respectively). Attributable risk associated with low grip strength was also high in black men (4.3 cases) but not in black women (0.4 cases).  Conclusions Low strength is associated with a disproportionately large number of diabetes cases in South‐Asian men and women and in black men. Trials are needed to determine whether interventions to improve strength in these groups could help reduce ethnic inequalities in diabetes prevalence.""",Yes,"""Introduction Type 2 diabetes is a major public health problem, accounting for 10% of healthcare expenditure and almost 400 million cases globally 1. In Westernized countries, diabetes prevalence is more than double in black 2, 3 and three‐ to fourfold higher in South‐Asian populations 3, 4 compared with white European populations, and worldwide diabetes prevalence is increasing faster in Asian and African countries than in Europe and high‐income English‐speaking countries 5.  There is evidence that strength could be an important risk factor for diabetes. Low hand‐grip strength has been predictive of incident diabetes in prospective cohort studies of Australian men of predominantly white European origin 6 and in Japanese‐American men and women 7. In addition, Canadian 8 and Japanese 9 studies have reported associations between indices of musculoskeletal fitness and diabetes risk. There is also evidence that participation in muscle strengthening exercise affects risk of Type 2 diabetes, independent of participation in aerobic physical activity 10, 11; however, the evidence is not unequivocal, with the Prospective Urban‐Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study undertaken across 17 countries reporting no significant association between grip strength and diabetes, although a clear trend was evident 12.

Isometric grip force was assessed from a single 3‐s maximal grip effort of the right and left arms, with the participant seated upright with their elbow by their side and flexed at 90° so that their forearm was facing forwards and placed on an armrest. The mean of the right and left values, expressed in absolute units (kg), and relative to body weight (kg per kg body weight), was used in the analysis, as reported elsewhere 16, 17.  Physical activity Physical activity was assessed by a self‐report questionnaire, based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form, with participants reporting frequency and duration of walking, moderate and vigorous activity undertaken in a typical week. Data were analysed in accordance with the IPAQ scoring protocol (http://www.ipaq.ki.se/scoring.pdf), and total physical activity was computed as the sum of walking, moderate and vigorous activity, measured as metabolic equivalents h/week). Participants were excluded from the analyses if they recorded implausible values, defined as the sum of their total physical activity, sleeping time and television‐viewing exceeding 24 h.  Adiposity measurements Anthropometric measurements were obtained by trained clinic staff using standard operating procedures and regularly calibrated equipment. Weight, percentage body fat and fat‐free mass (by bio‐impedance) were measured using standard operating procedures, without shoes and outdoor clothing, using the Tanita BC 418MA body composition analyser (Tanita Corp., Arlington Heights, IL, USA). Height was measured, without shoes, using the wall‐mounted SECA 240 height measure. BMI was calculated as body mass (kg) divided by the square of height (metres).  Assessment of covariates Potential confounders were identified a priori based on established relationships, with diabetes and muscular strength or both. Area‐based socio‐economic status was derived from postcode of residence, using the Townsend score, which is derived from census data on housing, employment, social class and car availability.

""",Yes,"""Background The associations of social isolation and loneliness with premature mortality are well known, but the risk factors linking them remain unclear. We sought to identify risk factors that might explain the increased mortality in socially isolated and lonely individuals.  Methods We used prospective follow-up data from the UK Biobank cohort study to assess self-reported isolation (a three-item scale) and loneliness (two questions). The main outcomes were all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We calculated the percentage of excess risk mediated by risk factors to assess the extent to which the associations of social isolation and loneliness with mortality were attributable to differences between isolated and lonely individuals and others in biological (body-mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and handgrip strength), behavioural (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity), socioeconomic (education, neighbourhood deprivation, and household income), and psychological (depressive symptoms and cognitive capacity) risk factors.""",Yes,"""Findings 466 901 men and women (mean age at baseline 56·5 years [SD 8·1]) were included in the analyses, with a mean follow-up of 6·5 years (SD 0·8).

The minimally adjusted hazard ratio for mortality risk related to loneliness was 1·38 (95% CI 1·30–1·47), which reduced to 0·99 (95% CI 0·93–1·06) after full adjustment for baseline risks.  Interpretation Isolated and lonely people are at increased risk of death.

Despite this, many epidemiologists and economists are acutely aware that correlations and multivariable adjusted regressions can be unreliable evidence of causation20,21,22.""",Yes,"""The ideal experiment to test this hypothesis, randomizing the age at which children leave school, is unlikely to be ethical, cost-effective or timely. A more feasible, and potentially robust, research design is to exploit natural experiments that affected when people left school but are not related to confounding factors23,24. One widely used natural experiment is changes to the legal minimum school leaving age. These changes forced some people to stay in school for longer than they would have otherwise chosen.""  ""Researchers have previously used this policy change to investigate the effects of forcing students to stay in school longer using administrative data and longitudinal cohort studies2, 4, 27, 28. However, the cohort studies had relatively small samples and, as a result, produced relatively imprecise estimates of the effects of education. Previous results from administrative data lacked detailed information needed to identify people born in England who were affected by the reform, or on many outcomes of interest such as cognition or clinical measures of ageing, for example, grip strength.""",Yes,"""In the current study, we used the raising of the school leaving age in 1972 as a natural experiment to estimate the causal effects of schooling.

Participants self‐reported their age, sex, and ethnicity. Ethnicity was categorized as White or other (mixed, Asian, Black, Chinese, and other). A Townsend deprivation score was computed for all participants using information about employment, car and home ownership, and household overcrowding.20 A higher Townsend deprivation score is indicative of greater levels of an area's socio‐economic deprivation.20 Participants reported their smoking status (never, previous, or current) and their alcohol intake (never, previous, or current). Data on physical activity including frequency (number of days in a typical week that participants performed 10 min or more of walking, moderate, and vigorous physical activity) and duration (minutes spent on each activity category on a typical day) were collected by asking questions similar to those included in the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.21 For each activity category, the frequency was multiplied by the duration and the metabolic equivalent value (3.3 for walking, 4.0 for moderate physical activity, and 8.0 for vigorous physical activity), which were then summed to generate a score of metabolic equivalent minutes of physical activity per week for each participant.  Medical history and current medications Self‐reported data on medical conditions were collected at baseline by asking participants whether a doctor has diagnosed any cancer or diabetes. Participants reported if they had undergone bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy or were on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Self‐reported data on fracture occurrence (yes or no) over the past 5 years were also collected. Information on X‐ray verification was unavailable.  Quantitative heel ultrasound Quantitative ultrasound of the heel was performed using the Sahara Clinical Sonometer (Hologic, Bedford, Massachusetts) according to a standardized protocol. Trained staff checked if participants were able to undertake both left and right heel ultrasound measurement. Those with open wounds, breaks or sores around the heel, or metal parts (such as pins) in the heel did not undertake measurement of that heel. Each centre used the same machine model, and quality control was performed with a phantom on a daily basis as per manufacturer's instructions. The mean values for BMDs (g/cm2) and BMD T‐scores for the left and right heel were computed.  Anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance measurements Height was measured using the SECA 240 height measure (SECA, Hamburg, Germany). Participants removed their socks and footwear and stood flat footed with their heels against a back plate. Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a segmental body composition analyser (Tanita BC‐418MA, Tokyo, Japan). Height and weight were used to calculate BMI as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). Waist circumference was measured at the level of the umbilicus using a tape measure. All these measurements were performed by trained staff.  Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) was calculated using the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) equation published previously by Janssen and colleagues22:  urn:x-wiley:21905991:media:jcsm12359:jcsm12359-math-0001 where ht2 = height in centimetres squared; R = resistance in ohms; for gender, men = 1 and women = 0; and age is in years.

We tested whether individuals with low cardiovascular disease risk, aged 60–69 years old at baseline in two large cohorts, were less likely to develop aging-related adverse health outcomes.  Methods Data were from population representative medical records (Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD] England, n = 239,591) and healthy volunteers (UK Biobank [UKB], n = 181,820), followed for ≤10 years. A cardiovascular disease risk score (CRS) summarized smoking status, LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass index, fasting glucose and physical activity, grouping individuals as low (ie, all factors near ideal), moderate, or high CRS.

All associations showed dose–response relationships, and results were similar in both cohorts.

Total minutes spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity per week were calculated....Outcomes Main outcomes considered in this study were geriatric syndromes commonly diagnosed in older persons, which could be adequately ascertained from the available data and hence differ between the two data sources used. We also report data on additional outcomes including all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer to confirm associations seen previously and hence show our measure of the CRS is valid.  Assessment of baseline outcomes (UK Biobank) UKB allowed estimation of self-reported health status, chronic pain, and frailty and measured lung function. Participants reported their health as excellent, good, fair, or poor. Reported pain anywhere in the body (back; facial; headaches; hip; knee; neck/shoulder; stomach/abdominal) was considered as chronic pain if it lasted for more than 3 months. Grip strength was measured in both hands using a hydraulic hand dynamometer and the maximum reading was categorized into sex-specific quintiles. The prevalence of frailty was estimated using a modified Fried Frailty phenotype (13) and included two or more of self-reported weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, self-reported slow walking pace, or low measured grip strength (lowest quintile, sex specific). The low physical activity criteria were excluded from our definition as this is also a component of the CRS. A previous study showed that a four-criteria definition of Fried Frailty, excluding physical activity, had good specificity (0.98) but lower sensitivity (0.62) (14). Lung function was assessed by Vitalograph Pneumotrac 6800 spirometer and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (categorized into sex-specific quintiles).  Assessment of incident outcomes (UK Biobank and CPRD) Incident events available in both data sets included all-cause mortality, incident CVD events (coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure), dementia, depression, chronic anemia, cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease....In UKB, measured cholesterol and glucose levels were not available, so we used proxy markers such as diagnoses of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes, or related treatment receipt to classify risk factor status.

We used two large-scale cohorts selecting individuals aged 60–69 years old at baseline and both followed for up to 10 years. Our findings show that older adults with these low CVD risk profiles experience substantially better outcomes in a wide range of health domains typically associated with aging. In particular, the low CVD risk profile was associated with markedly lower risks of frailty on both the Fried and Rockwood approaches to defining frailty. Estimates for all conditions were remarkably similar in the two cohorts despite one being population representative and the other composed of healthier volunteers. There were also differences in risk factor ascertainment in the two datasets, but the similarity of estimates obtained suggests that the results are robust.""",Yes,"""n UKB, measured cholesterol and glucose levels were not available, so we used proxy markers such as diagnoses of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes, or related treatment receipt to classify risk factor status. Given that the treatments have been shown in randomized trials to be effective at CVD risk reduction, our classification of these risks as high is somewhat conservative. In CPRD, nonrecording of risk factors by general practitioners is not at random (rather likely reflecting the absence of clinical symptoms, signs, and low clinical suspicion), making multiple imputation of missing data inappropriate. We took the prudent approach of assigning those with missing values to the low CRS group and showed comparable associations between the CRS and all-cause mortality in those with and without missing data. Both of these approaches are conservative, that is, in UKB perhaps including some individuals on treatment as high risk when their true risk level was reduced and in CPRD possibly including some individuals with no data on risks recorded as not having low risks when they actually had CVD risk factors: The combined effects of these conservative approaches may have led to underestimation of true effect sizes.  In addition, in CPRD, for cholesterol and glucose measurements, a long lead-in period of up to 8.5 years were defined, with the support from clinicians, on the basis of the available data for building a cohort. This presents the possibility that people with a normal blood test value might develop the condition of interest (eg, high cholesterol and fasting glucose) and thus be misclassified. However, this misclassification will bias results toward the null and is unlikely to have influenced the direction of our results. In the CPRD primary care records, people with CVD risk factors may have been seen by primary care during follow-up more often, with better ascertainment of outcomes. However, our ascertainment of outcomes in both studies included hospital admission records and death certificates, so at least for the more severe health events, ascertainment of outcomes was likely unbiased. Also, we highlight that the inclusion of hypertension and diabetes as components of the Rockwood frailty index contribute to a higher frailty score for those with higher CRS. However, as this influence is constant for frailty estimates over time (at index date as well as throughout the follow-up period), expectation is that the effect is minimized for the analysis of frailty progression over time.  Some of the risk factor measures may reflect elements of subclinical pathology, perhaps from early life exposures that may not be amenable to intervention. However, there are many clinical trials of, for example, blood pressure and cholesterol reduction in middle age or later life that have reported large reductions in CVD risk and mortality (34,35), suggesting that risks even in midlife and later life are susceptible to change. Clearly, only randomized trials of comprehensive risk reduction for improving aging outcomes could provide definitive data, and such studies should be given high priority.  Future work should seek to study this question with a more complete set of measured risk factors. Future analyses could also separate the CRS into behavioral risk factors (eg, smoking and physical activity) and more proximal cardiovascular risk factors to tease out the effects of overlapping risk factors. Studies of inherited genetic risks could help provide unconfounded estimates for lifelong exposure to many of the studied risk factors. Interestingly, our recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of parental longevity (36) in UK Biobank found strong associations with lower genetic risks scores for several cardiovascular traits, including CVD, adverse lipid levels, and blood pressure. Our GWAS also identified a variant linked to smoking was associated with father’s survival. This suggests that genetic propensity to several of the cardiovascular risk factors used here in the CRS is associated with mortality and hence morbidity and that the CVD risk factor associations reported are likely to be causal""",Partially,"Discuss direction but not magnitude of how much the effect sizes may be underestimated ""In UKB, measured cholesterol and glucose levels were not available, so we used proxy markers such as diagnoses of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes, or related treatment receipt to classify risk factor status.

Multivariate logistic regression models were used, adjusting for potential confounders including: demographic and life-style factors, comorbidity and psychotropic medication.""",Yes,"""Results Of the 140,564 eligible participants, evidence of probable major depression was reported by 30,145 (21.5%). The fully adjusted odds ratios (OR) for obese participants were 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12, 1.20) using BMI, 1.15 (95% CI 1.11, 1.19) using WC, 1.09 (95% CI 1.05, 1.13) using WHR and 1.18 (95% CI 1.12, 1.25) using BF% (all p < 0.001). There was a significant interaction between adiposity and gender (p = 0.001). Overweight women were at increased risk of depression with a dose response relationship across the overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), obese I (30.0-34.9 kg/m2), II (35.0-39.9 kg/m2) and III (≥40.0 kg/m2) categories; fully adjusted ORs 1.14, 1.20, 1.29 and 1.48, respectively (all p < 0.001). In contrast, only obese III men had significantly increased risk of depression (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.08, 1.54, p = 0.006).  Conclusion Adiposity was associated with probable major depression, irrespective of the measurement used. The association was stronger in women than men. Physicians managing overweight and obese women should be alert to this increased risk.""",Yes,"""Background Both depression and obesity are major public health problems. Worldwide, more than 350 million individuals suffer from depression [1]. As a contributor to the burden of morbidity, it is ranked third globally and first in middle and high income countries, with morbidity expected to rise further [2]. In the United Kingdom alone, around 1 in 20 adults experience an episode of depression annually, and it is the third most common reason by patients to consult their general practitioner [3]. Major depression carries a significant economic and health burden [4, 5]. It is associated with increased physical comorbidity [6], reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [7], and impaired function in work, school and family life [8], as well as increased mortality [9], including suicides [10]. The prevalence of obesity is increasing both in the UK and worldwide [11], leading to suggestions of an “obesity pandemic” or “globesity”. As with depression, we know that adiposity is associated with reduced physical well-being [12], poor HRQoL [13–15], and higher societal costs [16].  The relationship between these two important public health problems has been the focus of an increasing number of studies over recent years, but these studies have produced inconsistent results [17, 18]. Some have reported positive associations [19] whilst others have reported negative [20] or no associations [21]. We previously showed that adiposity was significantly associated with poor overall HRQoL [13], but this was largely due to reductions in the physical component of HRQoL, with the mental component reduced only among morbidly obese and increased among overweight [14]. Furthermore, we found that poor mental health was confined to obese women under 45 years of age, and the apparent protective role of being overweight was confined to men aged 45–59 years [19].  A meta-analysis of population studies reported a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.26 (95% CI 1.17, 1.36) for the association between obesity and depression [22]. This association was only significant in women (OR 1.32). Of the 17 studies included, 16 used body mass index (BMI) as a measure of obesity. Another recent meta-analysis reported a pooled OR of 1.38 (95% CI 1.22, 1.57) for the association between central obesity and depression [23]. A total of 15 studies were included in this review, of which 14 used waist circumference (WC) as the measure of central obesity. Several studies showed that the association between obesity and depression is stronger in women [19, 24]. In contrast, a recent large study demonstrated that adiposity was a significant predictor of depression only in men [25].  In these two recent meta-analyses, most used self-reported adiposity measurements, and many were not adjusted for important potential confounders such as socio-economic status, physical comorbidity, and use of psychotropic medications. Only BMI and WC have been used as measures of adiposity, and they were simply dichotomized into obese and not obese, thereby losing information on the relationship across the spectrum of adiposity such as whether there is a dose relationship. There is some evidence that the relationship between adiposity and depression varies according to the level of adiposity [26] and that waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and body fat percentage (BF%) may also be associated with depression [27]. One recent, comparatively smaller German study (N = 4907) examined the association between obesity and depression, using the continuous measure of BMI, WC and WHR but not the direct measurement of BF% [28]. Overall, there is a paucity of larger studies which used other than BMI measures in exploring this association.""",Yes,"""There is some evidence that the relationship between adiposity and depression varies according to the level of adiposity [26] and that waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and body fat percentage (BF%) may also be associated with depression [27].

This relationship might play a role in the predisposition toward obesity. Neuroticism and executive function seem to be particularly involved, and reduced executive function has been proposed to underlie the association of neuroticism with sedentary behaviors and fatty food consumption. Despite the link between neuroticism, cognitive functions and obesity has been largely reported, conflicting evidence exists. Moreover, information regarding other cognitive domains, and studies on overweight individuals, are still scarce.  Methods We examined cross-sectional associations of neuroticism and cognitive function with overweight and obesity in a sample of 170 310 individuals from the UK Biobank cohort, adjusted for sociodemographic and life-style factors. Measures on fluid intelligence (FI) (reasoning ability), trail making test (TMT) (executive function), numeric memory test and pairs matching (PM) task (short-term memory) were extracted from the database. Correlations between neuroticism and cognitive performance were explored. Moreover, we investigated whether neuroticism and executive function could predict BMI variability over time.""",Partially,"Missing numerical result ""Results Reduced FI and short-term memory were associated with overweight and obesity, while reduced executive function was associated with obesity but not with overweight. Low neuroticism was associated with being overweight rather than lean or obese independently of gender and life-style. Furthermore, baseline neuroticism scores could predict BMI variations over 5–10 years follow-up, and high neuroticism correlated with lower cognitive performance.  Conclusions Lower cognitive performance is associated with both overweight and obesity, except for executive function, which was only related to obesity. Neuroticism correlated with performance on most of the cognitive domains tested, supporting the link between personality and cognition. Our findings also support the role of neuroticism in leading to greater weight variability over time, rather than to overweight/obesity itself""",Yes,"""1. Introduction Personality traits can be used to identify the appropriate weight loss treatment and management strategies for obese patients (Munro et al., 2011). The outcome of different weight loss interventions in obese people seems to be influenced by their underlying personality traits (Gerlach et al., 2015). For example, obese people with high reward dependence and cooperativeness are more willing to participate in behavioral group therapies (Sullivan et al., 2007). Moreover, patients with lower novelty seeking are more likely to effectively lose gain with this type of intervention (Sullivan et al., 2007). On the other hand, neuroticism and conscientiousness are respectively associated with the effectiveness of sirbutramin and orlitstat pharmacological weight loss therapies (Gerlach et al., 2015). Low conscientiousness and high neuroticism, in particular, have been associated with higher body mass index (BMI) (Sutin and Terracciano, 2017) and poorer health outcomes (Atherton et al., 2014). High neuroticism has been found to enhance the effect of polygenetic predisposition toward overweight and obesity (Clarke et al., 2015), and it has been associated with inflammatory indices and other environmental/social risk factors relating to obesity (Sutin and Terracciano, 2017). The tendency toward less physical activity and/or more sedentary behaviours observed in highly neurotic people has also been proposed to be at least partially responsible for the association with BMI (Kjelsas and Augestad, 2004; Sutin and Terracciano, 2016, 2017). Conflicting evidence has however been reported. Some studies (n = 11 554; n = 1 495 and n = 30 722, respectively) have shown low neuroticism to be associated with higher BMI (Kakizaki et al., 2008; Otonari et al., 2012; Shim et al., 2014), while a Danish study (n = 5 286) has failed in finding any association between BMI and neuroticism in either men or women (Wimmelmann et al., 2018). Psychological and psychiatric comorbidities might partially explain the discrepancies across studies (Paans et al., 2016). Moreover, other unrelated factors, such as the work dimension, and in particular the physical workload, have been found to interact with neuroticism in influencing BMI (Blanch and Aluja, 2013). The association between BMI and personality seems also to differ remarkably between genders, and is more consistent in women rather than men (Sutin and Terracciano, 2016, 2017). Finally, it is worth noticing that the ethnicity of the participants varies between studies, as the samples included Asian (Kakizaki et al., 2008; Otonari et al., 2012; Shim et al., 2014), European (Wimmelmann et al., 2018) or multi-ethnical participants (Sutin and Terracciano, 2016).  In recent years, a growing body of research has linked personality traits to cognitive performance (Burles et al., 2014; Caselli et al., 2016; Chapman et al., 2017; Dar-Nimrod et al., 2012; Munoz et al., 2013; Robison et al., 2017; Waggel et al., 2015; Wettstein et al., 2016). In particular, low neuroticism has been associated to a better executive function in middle-aged (Caselli et al., 2016; Robison et al., 2017) and elderly adults (Chapman et al., 2017; Waggel et al., 2015). Remarkably, executive function has been reported to predict the health behavior of the individuals more accurately than neuroticism (Hall et al., 2014), and reduced executive function has been associated with neuroticism and two lifestyle risk factors for obesity, namely sedentary behavior and fatty food consumption (Hall et al., 2014). The factors underlying this association are still unclear. Increased cortisol is associated with both specific personality traits and worse cognitive performance (Ouanes et al., 2017), however it does not seem to be mediating the link between personality and cognition (Ouanes et al., 2017). Nonetheless, the intertwining between executive function and neuroticism might play a role in predisposing to obesity development. In fact, obesity has been linked to an impairment in executive function (Dassen et al., 2018), and therapies targeting executive function seem to meliorate health behaviors in obese people by improving their cognitive flexibility (Allom et al., 2018). On the other hand, overweight people are understudied, and evidence is lacking regarding the existence of executive functions impairments in these population (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, information are lacking regarding overweight individuals’ cognitive performance on other domains, such as fluid intelligence, which has also been found to be impaired in obesity (Spyridaki et al., 2014). Nonetheless, overweight in mid-life has been related to lower short-term memory performance in later life (Hassing et al., 2010). Accordingly, high BMI has been related to accelerated cognitive aging (Kirton and Dotson, 2016).""",Yes,"""The factors underlying this association are still unclear.

The answers “Yes” and “No” were respectively assigned the values of 1 and 0, and the scores were summed up to obtain the neuroticism score.  Short-term memory was assessed with the PM and numeric memory tests. The PM test consisted in instructing the participants to memorise the position of as many matching pairs of cards as possible. The cards were then turned face down on the screen, and the participants were asked to touch as many pairs as possible in the fewest tries. Two rounds were conducted, the first round using 3 pairs of cards and the second 6 pairs of cards.

A series of separate multinomial logistic regression models were performed to investigate associations of BMI with neuroticism and cognitive performance on the numeric memory, FI, PM and TMT tests. Two models were carried out for a sensitivity analysis. The first model was corrected for age, gender, education and ethnical background. The second model was additionally corrected for smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, and physical activity. The threshold for significance was set at p < 0.01 for the cross-sectional analysis to correct for multiple testing according to Bonferroni’s approach (0.05/5 tests). Based on previous literature, we also tested for an effect of the interaction between neuroticism and gender on BMI. Furthermore, we investigated whether age could influence the association between BMI and neuroticism or cognitive function by also testing for the effect of the age*cognition interaction on BMI. The threshold for significance was set at p < 0.012, to correct for multiple testing (0.05 / 4 tests).  Additionally, we ran five generalized linear models (gamma with log-link) to investigate whether BMI, when treated as continuous instead of categorical, still showed the same pattern of associations with neuroticism and cognitive function. The same two abovementioned models were run. The threshold for significance was again set at p < 0.01 for the cross-sectional analysis to correct for multiple testing according to Bonferroni’s approach.  Correlations between neuroticism score and each of the cognitive tests were investigated via separate models according to the distribution of the dependent variables. ANOVA was used to test correlations with FI and PM (Glass et al., 1972; Harwell et al., 1992; Lix et al., 1996), while correlations with numeric memory were assessed with a negative binomial generalized linear model, and correlations with TMT were assessed with a gamma generalized linear model. The threshold for significance was set at p < 0.013, to correct for multiple testing according to Bonferroni. The same abovementioned adjusted models were used.  Individuals with high neuroticism tend to vary their weight more than individuals with lower neuroticism levels, in terms of decreases as well as increases in BMI (Sutin et al., 2011; Sutin and Terracciano, 2017). Thus, we investigated correlations between neuroticism and BMI variation over time. BMI variation was calculated by subtracting the baseline BMI from the BMI at each follow-up point, and considering the absolute value of the variation. As executive function has been reported to predict the health behavior of the individuals more accurately than neuroticism (Hall et al., 2014), we also investigated correlations between executive function and BMI variations. To this purpose, separate ANOVAs were carried out to test whether baseline neuroticism and TMT ratio could predict BMI variations at each of the two follow-up points.

The second model was additionally corrected for smoking status, alcohol intake frequency, and physical activity. The threshold for significance was set at p < 0.01 for the cross-sectional analysis to correct for multiple testing according to Bonferroni’s approach (0.05/5 tests). Based on previous literature, we also tested for an effect of the interaction between neuroticism and gender on BMI. Furthermore, we investigated whether age could influence the association between BMI and neuroticism or cognitive function by also testing for the effect of the age*cognition interaction on BMI. The threshold for significance was set at p < 0.012, to correct for multiple testing (0.05 / 4 tests).  Additionally, we ran five generalized linear models (gamma with log-link) to investigate whether BMI, when treated as continuous instead of categorical, still showed the same pattern of associations with neuroticism and cognitive function. The same two abovementioned models were run. The threshold for significance was again set at p < 0.01 for the cross-sectional analysis to correct for multiple testing according to Bonferroni’s approach.  Correlations between neuroticism score and each of the cognitive tests were investigated via separate models according to the distribution of the dependent variables. ANOVA was used to test correlations with FI and PM (Glass et al., 1972; Harwell et al., 1992; Lix et al., 1996), while correlations with numeric memory were assessed with a negative binomial generalized linear model, and correlations with TMT were assessed with a gamma generalized linear model. The threshold for significance was set at p < 0.013, to correct for multiple testing according to Bonferroni. The same abovementioned adjusted models were used.  Individuals with high neuroticism tend to vary their weight more than individuals with lower neuroticism levels, in terms of decreases as well as increases in BMI (Sutin et al., 2011; Sutin and Terracciano, 2017). Thus, we investigated correlations between neuroticism and BMI variation over time. BMI variation was calculated by subtracting the baseline BMI from the BMI at each follow-up point, and considering the absolute value of the variation. As executive function has been reported to predict the health behavior of the individuals more accurately than neuroticism (Hall et al., 2014), we also investigated correlations between executive function and BMI variations. To this purpose, separate ANOVAs were carried out to test whether baseline neuroticism and TMT ratio could predict BMI variations at each of the two follow-up points.

Introduction Musculoskeletal pain is a major public health burden worldwide. It is common in western countries with a prevalence estimated as high as 74% in the general population,1 leading to restrictions in physical function and mobility impairments including decreased balance and gait speed, reduced quality of life and disability.2, 3 Chronic musculoskeletal pain, generally defined as persistent or recurrent pain lasting more than three months, is typically represented by conditions such as low back pain, neck pain, chronic widespread pain (fibromyalgia) and osteoarthritis.4, 5 A recent study of the global burden of the 328 diseases and injuries reported that low back pain, neck pain, other musculoskeletal disorders and osteoarthritis were ranked 1st, 6th, 7th and 12th, respectively, for years lived with disability (YLDs).6 Multiple risk factors have been reported to be associated with chronic musculoskeletal pain.4, 5, 7 There is a difference in pain mechanisms underlying acute and chronic pain. In addition to peripheral tissue injury, evidence is growing that central nervous system factor is of prominent importance in the development and persistence of chronic pain.9  In pain research, the concept of ‘multi-site’ or ‘multiple site’ pain (MSP) has been proposed; defined as musculoskeletal pain occurring at more than one site, although, currently, an exact definition is still unclear. The prevalence of MSP is approximately 41–75% depending on study population and number of painful sites measured.10 MSP has been found to be associated with poorer physical and psychological health, worse health-related quality of life, and more severe depressive symptoms as compared to single-site musculoskeletal pain in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.11, 12 In addition, several studies reported the adverse effects of MSP on other health outcomes, including risk of falls,13 cognitive impairments14 and sleep quality.15 There is also evidence to support more pronounced associations with these outcomes as painful sites increase. Many of these outcomes may result from and lead to reduced physical activity (PA).16, 18, 19  Low PA is the fourth leading cause of mortality worldwide. Lack of PA is associated with an increased risk for cardio-metabolic disorders20 such as diabetes and heart diseases; and common mental disorders,21 such as depression and anxiety. A recent meta-analysis of eight studies found that older people with musculoskeletal pain are less likely to engage in PA than those without musculoskeletal pain.22 All included studies have relied on a self-reported PA from which it is hard to quantify total PA across different domains. Self-reported activity levels are however poorly correlated with objective measures of PA participation, i.e. accelerometer, with self-reported PA estimates more likely to be higher than those measured by objectively measured PA.23 This highlights the need for accurate and reliable measurements of PA in assessing the relationship between PA and health outcomes.  Pain experience is a complex and multifactorial nature with multiple domains involved including peripheral, psychological and neurological.24 This heterogeneity leads to the variation in individual pain perception (including pain intensity, frequency and pattern).25 PA offers a broad range of health benefits; however, the mechanisms by which exercise exerts its effects remain unclear. There is evidence from mechanistically-orientated studies of PA and pain relief to support a variety mechanisms, including changes in both the peripheral and central components of the nervous systems,26, 27, 28 reduced level of chronic inflammation/comorbidities,29, 30, 31 muscle strengthening and aerobic capacity32, 33 and improvements in psychological and cognitive function.32, 34 Whilst the causal direction of PA and pain is hard to discern, awareness is increasing that chronic pain is associated with brain structural change,35 psychosocial issues (e.g. fear-avoidance beliefs and behaviours, fear of falling32 and cognitive impairment36), which in turn contribute to reduced PA.""",Yes,"""To our knowledge, there are no previous studies reporting on the relationship between pain at multiple sites and objectively measured physical work capacity (PWC) and PA.""",Yes,""". Based on the relationship that chronic pain negatively affects PA and its potential mechanisms, we hypothesised that there is a relationship between pain at multiple sites and reduced physical work capacity (PWC) and PA, and that the relationship was stronger in those with a greater number of painful sites. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the association between MSP and objectively measured levels of PWC and PA in a population-based sample from the UK Biobank.""",Yes,Methods on page 2,Partially-External,"""We used data from the UK Biobank which is a large, population-based and ongoing longitudinal study assessing how lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors are linked to a wide range of health-related outcomes.37 Detailed information about this project including scientific rationale, study design, and survey methods has been previously described.38 A total of 502,656 individuals aged between 40–69 years were recruited in 2006–2010""",No,,Yes,"""A total of 502,656 individuals aged between 40–69 years were recruited in 2006–2010""",No,,NA,Not used,Partially,"Missing exposure (pain) data collection dates ""A single 7-day period PA was measured in a subsample of the UK Biobank between 2013 and 2015 using an accelerometer which is considered the ‘gold standard’ objective assessment of PA for epidemiological studies.3""",Yes,"""A total of 9856 participants who had complete accelerometer, PWC and pain information were included in this study.""",Yes,"""We used data from the UK Biobank which is a large, population-based and ongoing longitudinal study assessing how lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors are linked to a wide range of health-related outcomes.37 Detailed information about this project including scientific rationale, study design, and survey methods has been previously described.38 A total of 502,656 individuals aged between 40–69 years were recruited in 2006–2010""",Yes,"""A total of 9856 participants who had complete accelerometer, PWC and pain information were included in this study.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,"""A single 7-day period PA was measured in a subsample of the UK Biobank between 2013 and 2015 using an accelerometer which is considered the ‘gold standard’ objective assessment of PA for epidemiological studies.39 Overall, a total of 236,519 participants of the UK Biobank were invited to wear an accelerometer in order to capture data on PA for a 7-day period. Of these, 106,053 agreed to wear an Axivity AX3 wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer (44.8%) over a 7-day period. Participants were asked to wear the accelerometer on their dominant wrist continuously while engaging in their normal daily activities, and then return the device. This study used the accelerometry scores which were calculated from the raw accelerometer data with a rigorous data processing procedure, published elsewhere.40 This considered both the time and intensity of PA to maintain the average vector magnitude value over five seconds epochs, thereby providing a summary score representing an average PA level over a given time period. 103,578 participants were included in wear time analysis. Of them, 80.6% of participants wore the device for >150 h out of a scheduled 168 h. 6978 participants (6.7% of sample) who had insufficient device wear time (<72 h) were removed.40 We categorised PA into low, moderate and vigorous intensity.

Moderate and vigorous PA were defined as time spent in 100–400 mg and >400 mg of activity, respectively.41, 42  The UK Biobank participants underwent a cardio-respiratory fitness test which consisted of heart-rate monitoring (using a 4-lead electrocardiograph [ECG]; Cardiosoft v6.51) during cycle ergometry on a stationary bike (eBike, Firmware v1.7) with a ramp slope that is adapted to the individual based on age, gender, weight and medical history. Detailed protocol about cardio-respiratory fitness test has been previously described.43 ECGs were recorded pre-test (15 s), during activity (6 min) and in recovery (1 min). The participant’s risk category was first calculated to determine what level of activity they should perform or have only a resting ECG performed. There were five risk categories: Category 2 consisted of participants who had a heart condition or diastolic blood pressure ≥95 mm of Hg and systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm of Hg; Category 3 had participants who had chest pain during physical activity or missing data on height/heart rate; Category 4 consisted of participants who had chest pain at rest, who were unable to walk/cycle unaided for ten minutes, were pregnant, who had no data on weight, blood pressure, or pacemaker status, had diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mm of Hg and systolic blood pressure ≥180 mm of Hg, or weighed ≥150 kg; Category 5 comprised participants who had a pacemaker; Category 1 consisted of participants who did not belong to any of the above categories.

Participants were asked whether they had pain (yes/no) at the: hip, knee, back and neck/shoulder for more than three months. The number of reported painful sites was summed to create a total number of painful sites with a range from 0 to 4, which was then categorised into three groups (0–2, 3 and 4 painful sites).  A single 7-day period PA was measured in a subsample of the UK Biobank between 2013 and 2015 using an accelerometer which is considered the ‘gold standard’ objective assessment of PA for epidemiological studies.39 Overall, a total of 236,519 participants of the UK Biobank were invited to wear an accelerometer in order to capture data on PA for a 7-day period. Of these, 106,053 agreed to wear an Axivity AX3 wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer (44.8%) over a 7-day period. Participants were asked to wear the accelerometer on their dominant wrist continuously while engaging in their normal daily activities, and then return the device. This study used the accelerometry scores which were calculated from the raw accelerometer data with a rigorous data processing procedure, published elsewhere.40 This considered both the time and intensity of PA to maintain the average vector magnitude value over five seconds epochs, thereby providing a summary score representing an average PA level over a given time period. 103,578 participants were included in wear time analysis. Of them, 80.6% of participants wore the device for >150 h out of a scheduled 168 h. 6978 participants (6.7% of sample) who had insufficient device wear time (<72 h) were removed.40 We categorised PA into low, moderate and vigorous intensity. Low intensity PA was defined as time spent in less than 100 milligravities (mg) activity. Moderate and vigorous PA were defined as time spent in 100–400 mg and >400 mg of activity, respectively.41, 42  The UK Biobank participants underwent a cardio-respiratory fitness test which consisted of heart-rate monitoring (using a 4-lead electrocardiograph [ECG]; Cardiosoft v6.51) during cycle ergometry on a stationary bike (eBike, Firmware v1.7) with a ramp slope that is adapted to the individual based on age, gender, weight and medical history. Detailed protocol about cardio-respiratory fitness test has been previously described.43 ECGs were recorded pre-test (15 s), during activity (6 min) and in recovery (1 min). The participant’s risk category was first calculated to determine what level of activity they should perform or have only a resting ECG performed. There were five risk categories: Category 2 consisted of participants who had a heart condition or diastolic blood pressure ≥95 mm of Hg and systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm of Hg; Category 3 had participants who had chest pain during physical activity or missing data on height/heart rate; Category 4 consisted of participants who had chest pain at rest, who were unable to walk/cycle unaided for ten minutes, were pregnant, who had no data on weight, blood pressure, or pacemaker status, had diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mm of Hg and systolic blood pressure ≥180 mm of Hg, or weighed ≥150 kg; Category 5 comprised participants who had a pacemaker; Category 1 consisted of participants who did not belong to any of the above categories. For participants in Categories 1 and 2, their predicted absolute maximum workload was calculated according to age, height, weight, resting heart rate and sex using the following formula: Absolute  maximum  workload = 105.2749 + (−0.0935 × age) + (−0.0280973 × age × age) + (2.809493 × sex) + (119.0087 × height) + (0.309456 × weight) + (−2.698067 × resting heart  rate) + (0.0090985 × resting  heart  rate × resting  heart  rate) + (−0.3783405 × age × sex) + (60.72548 × height × sex) + (−0.15016 × weight × sex) + (−0.3730664 × resting  heart  rate × sex) + (0.0180811 × resting  heart  rate × age)  The percentage levels of effort during activity were then determined according to their risk category. The target-power was 50% and 30% of the absolute maximum workload for participants in Categories 1 and 2, respectively. For Category 3, participants were instructed to cycle at constant level whereas for Category 4 the protocol dictated that measurement was to be taken only at rest. Lastly, ECG was avoided for Category 5 since it was unsafe or pointless. Participants were instructed to either cycle at a constant workload for 6 min aiming for approximately 60 revolutions per minute, or cycle for the first 2 min at a constant workload, with the pedalling resistance increasing over the last 4 min.  The covariates included in the analyses were age, body mass index (BMI), sex, highest educational level attained, ethnicity, smoking status, number of treatments/medications and grip strength. Age and BMI was treated as continuous. Highest educational level was categorised as: College or university degree; A levels, AS levels, or equivalent; O levels, GCSEs, or equivalent; CSE or equivalent; NVQ, HND, HNC, or equivalent; other professional qualifications; and none of the above. The ethnic group of each participant was recorded as: White, Mixed race, Asian or Asian British, Black or Black British, Chinese, other ethnic group and do not know. Smoking status was assessed by the question, “do you smoke tobacco now?” for which the options were never, previous, and current. Number of treatments/medications was assessed by asking participants to list any prescription medications they regular take or short-term medications. Grip strength of both hands was measured in kilogram (kg) using a Jamar J00105 hydraulic hand dynamometer. For the analyses, we used the grip strength values of the dominant hand assessed by the question: “Are you right or left handed?” We used the maximum of the grip strength scores of both hands for participants who were ambidextrous or had not indicated their handedness. ANOVA and χ2 tests were used to compare differences across groups by number of painful sites. Linear regression was then used to assess the association between number of painful sites and PWC and PA, before and after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, education level, smoking status, ethnicity, number of treatments/medications and grip strength.

",Yes,"""Tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of an external stimulus, affects about 16% of the adult population (Dawes et al. 2014; McCormack et al. 2014). Hearing loss has been established as a major risk factor for tinnitus (Nondahl et al. 2011). It has been suggested that degraded auditory input due to cochlear damage can trigger aberrant neuronal activity that is interpreted as tinnitus (Preece et al. 2003; Eggermont & Roberts 2014). The burden imposed by tinnitus is complex and extends beyond the persistence of the percept itself. The overall perceived handicap can include hearing difficulties, anxiety, depression, inability to relax, and sleep difficulties (Tyler & Baker 1983; Langguth 2011; McCormack et al. 2015). This heterogeneity in symptoms is reflected in the wide variety of proposed treatments, many of which are not supported by strong evidence for their effectiveness (Baguley et al. 2013).  Patients and clinicians agree that the management of tinnitus in those with profound hearing loss remains one of the top priorities for future tinnitus research (Hall et al. 2013). One potential device that has been proposed to manage tinnitus in the profoundly deaf is the cochlear implant (CI), which is an established intervention to restore useful aspects of hearing in these patients (Faulkner & Pisoni 2013). Cochlear implantation involves the surgical placement of an electrode array within the cochlea to stimulate spiral ganglion cells electrically to convey auditory information (Loizou 1998). On average, as many as 80% of candidates for cochlear implantation report experiencing tinnitus but the percept appears to subside in many after implantation (Baguley & Atlas 2007). As a result, it has been suggested that cochlear implantation should be considered as a treatment for tinnitus in the profoundly deaf (Tyler et al. 2008b). However, there remains a lack of comprehensive assessments of the burden of tinnitus and tinnitus-related symptoms after cochlear implantation (Baguley 2010) and therefore a lack of evidence for which symptoms may or may not be alleviated by implantation.  Many studies that have evaluated the impact of cochlear implantation on tinnitus have assessed outcome in terms of relief from the percept, for example, the reduction in tinnitus loudness (for a review see Baguley & Atlas 2007; Arts et al. 2012). Other studies have focused on designing and optimizing electrical stimulation strategies to suppress the percept (Chang & Zeng 2012; Arts et al. 2015). The assumption is that the suppression of tinnitus will alleviate its intrusiveness and reduce overall burden. However, although the number of profoundly deaf patients reporting tinnitus decreases following implantation, clinical observations suggest that a large proportion of CI recipients still experience some degree of tinnitus-related handicap (Pan et al. 2009; Bovo et al. 2011; Kloostra et al. 2015; Ramakers et al. 2015). A review of studies that have assessed the levels of tinnitus-related handicap following implantation suggested that about 25% of CI users experience a clinically significant tinnitus, that is, a degree of tinnitus-related handicap that may warrant intervention (Baguley 2010).  The presence of tinnitus after implantation may be explained by the finding that tinnitus is suppressed mostly when the implant is stimulating the auditory nerve and often reverts back to its original loudness (or becomes louder) soon after stimulation is turned off (Zeng et al. 2011; Vlastarakos et al. 2014). Therefore, it is plausible that tinnitus could be still bothersome in CI users at night time if the CI is switched off before going to sleep (Chadha et al. 2009), and consequently that they would not experience a reduction in the occurrence of tinnitus-related insomnia. However, despite the decades of research and converging evidence that sleep difficulties are one of the most common tinnitus-related complaints (Tyler & Baker 1983; Langguth 2011), the treatment of tinnitus-related insomnia remains an outstanding uncertainty for both clinicians and patients (Hall et al. 2013).""",Yes,"""Few studies have assessed the association between tinnitus and sleep difficulties in CI users, or whether the presence of tinnitus leads to sleep difficulties after patients turn their CI off at night time.

Design:  The study was conducted using the UK Biobank resource, a population-based cohort of 40- to 69-year olds. Self-report data on hearing, tinnitus, sleep difficulties, and demographic variables were collected from cochlear implant users (n = 194) and individuals identified as potential candidates for cochlear implantation (n = 211). These “candidates” were selected based on (i) impaired hearing sensitivity, inferred from self-reported hearing aid use and (ii) impaired hearing function, inferred from an inability to report words accurately at negative signal to noise ratios on an unaided closed-set test of speech perception. Data on tinnitus (presence, persistence, and related distress) and on sleep difficulties were analyzed using logistic regression models controlling for gender, age, deprivation, and neuroticism. Results:  The prevalence of tinnitus was similar among implant users (50%) and candidates (52%; p = 0.39). However, implant users were less likely to report that their tinnitus was distressing at its worst (41%) compared with candidates (63%; p = 0.02). The logistic regression model suggested that this difference between the two groups could be explained by the fact that tinnitus was less persistent in implant users (46%) compared with candidates (72%; p < 0.001). Self-reported difficulties with sleep were similar among implant users (75%) and candidates (82%; p = 0.28), but participants with tinnitus were more likely to report sleep difficulties than those without (p < 0.001). The prevalence of sleep difficulties was not related to tinnitus persistence (p = 0.28) or the extent to which tinnitus was distressing (p = 0.55). Conclusions:  The lack of association between tinnitus persistence and sleep difficulties is compatible with the notion that tinnitus is suppressed in implant users primarily during active electrical stimulation and may return when the implant is switched off at night time. This explanation is supported by the similar prevalence of sleep problems among implant users and potential candidates for cochlear implantation, despite differences between the groups in tinnitus persistence and related emotional distress. Cochlear implantation may therefore not be an appropriate intervention where the primary aim is to alleviate sleep difficulties.

Further analyses revealed that this group difference was driven by the lower persistence of their tinnitus (Fig. 3): participants who reported tinnitus as less persistent were more likely to report a lower level of emotional distress as a result of their tinnitus.

Authors state  ""Questions about sleep in the UK Biobank study were not asked in the context of tinnitus. Therefore, the reported difficulties with sleep may have been unrelated to tinnitus but related to other factors, for example, other age-related health problems. However, self-reported difficulties with sleep were highly prevalent in all participants reporting current tinnitus. This association between tinnitus presence and sleep difficulties was found even after controlling for neuroticism, a factor shown to be associated with both tinnitus (McCormack et al. 2014, 2015) and sleep problems (Hintsanen et al. 2014).""  The present data cannot provide definitive estimates of the effect of implantation on tinnitus because it is not known whether tinnitus reported as occurring only in the past was abolished before or after implantation. If one assumes reporting moderately or severely distressing tinnitus as “significant” enough to consider additional tinnitus management options after implantation (Andersson et al. 2009), the estimate of 37% of CI users found in the present study (Table 3) would be somewhat higher than the 25% of “clinically significant” tinnitus estimated from data reported in other studies (Baguley 2010). If one also assumes that the candidate group was representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK, then the proportion of patients reporting current tinnitus of any kind (56%) was lower than the average estimate of 80% in CI candidates (lower limit of 67%) extrapolated from results of a number of studies (Baguley & Atlas 2007). One possible explanation for these discrepancies is that the UK Biobank study sampled from the middle-aged UK population (40 to 69 years old) and therefore excluded both younger and older adult CI users and candidates.  No discussion of potential sources of bias.   ",No,,Partially,"Generally cautious in interpretation of findings   e.g."" the limited information in the UK Biobank study on hearing loss and the type or number of devices used means that uncertainty remains as to whether (a) the difference in tinnitus persistence observed between CI users and potential candidates was a direct result of the devices used and (b) the subset of HA users identified as potential candidates were representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK. If the finding of lower tinnitus persistence among CI users compared with candidates is replicated in further observational and controlled studies, cochlear implantation could be considered as a potential treatment option for persistent and emotionally distressing tinnitus in those whose hearing loss may not otherwise make them a candidate. In those cases, implantation may have the potential to make tinnitus less persistent, possibly leading to a reduction in emotional distress.""  ""Studies investigating other aspects of tinnitus handicap in CI users are encouraging (e.g., anxiety and depression; Andersson et al. 2009; Olze et al. 2011; Kloostra et al. 2015), but a more comprehensive characterization of tinnitus symptoms is still needed to understand the burden of tinnitus after cochlear implantation.

We found a strong inverse association between annual ambient D‐UVB and odds of developing esophageal or gastric cancer: Compared to the lowest tertile, OR for the highest tertile was 0.64 (95%CI:0.51–0.79) in adjusted analysis. The association was strengthened when restricted to esophageal cancer (OR = 0.60; 95%CI:0.45–0.80) and esophageal adenocarcinoma cases (OR = 0.48; 95%CI: 0.34–0.68). Similar results were found in unadjusted and stratified analysis. In conclusion, ambient UVB radiation is inversely associated with the development of esophageal and gastric cancer, even in a high‐latitude country.""",Yes,"""Introduction An estimated 456 000 new cases and 400 000 deaths in 2012 make esophageal cancer the eighth most common cancer worldwide, but the sixth most common cause of cancer death due to a very poor survival 1. Similarly, gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy, but the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide (951 000 new cases and 723 000 deaths) 1. Two main histological subtypes of esophageal cancers are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Notably, the two subtypes differ in terms of their risk factors and incidence patterns 2-4. The majority of adenocarcinoma cases develop from Barrett's mucosa in the lower third of the esophagus, while SCC typically occurs in the upper two‐thirds of the esophagus 3.  Synthesis of vitamin D in the skin following exposure to UVB from sunlight is the main source of vitamin D for humans, particularly among those who do not take vitamin D supplements 5. Vitamin D has been associated with reduced risk of multiple internal cancers 6-8. For esophageal and gastric cancer, the evidence is sparse and vastly mixed: a recent systematic review 9 found an increased risk of esophageal cancer overall with higher 25‐hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration; a nonsignificantly increased risk of adenocarcinoma with higher dietary vitamin D intake, but a nonsignificantly decreased risk of SCC 10-12. Finally, a single study reported a significantly decreased risk of adenocarcinoma with higher lifetime UVB exposure 13. In a similar study, a nonsignificantly decreased risk of gastric cancer was observed with higher 25(OH)D, but a nonsignificantly increased risk with higher vitamin D intake 14. Therefore, mixed evidence from a limited number of mostly small studies prevents any conclusions from being drawn and highlights the need for more research 14, 15. Additionally, dietary sources of vitamin D from food have been shown to be poor determinants of vitamin D in some studies 8, 16, and therefore, the results from studies measuring only dietary sources from foods should be interpreted with caution. 25(OH)D is known as the best measure of vitamin D status at a given point in time; however, it is strongly affected by the season of blood draw and other, sometimes particular circumstances (e.g. return from sun holiday); moreover, it does not capture exposure over a prolonged time period. This may be important when examining the relationship between 25(OH)D and conditions which take time to develop. Furthermore, 25(OH)D concentration at the time of blood draw may be of limited relevance: For example, vitamin D status at cancer diagnosis is of limited value when assessing the role in cancer occurrence. Therefore, using UVB instead of 25(OH)D offers some important advantages for epidemiological studies, provided it can be captured accurately—but this has largely not been the case to date, as most studies use total UV dose, ignore important factors such as cloud cover and ozone or assume equal exposure for the large geographical region; in addition, majority of published studies that used UV are ecological in design.""",Yes,""" Therefore, using UVB instead of 25(OH)D offers some important advantages for epidemiological studies, provided it can be captured accurately—but this has largely not been the case to date, as most studies use total UV dose, ignore important factors such as cloud cover and ozone or assume equal exposure for the large geographical region; in addition, majority of published studies that used UV are ecological in design.

Cluster Analysis and Association Rule Mining. Owing to the complex nature of the data and the inclusion of 36 chronic conditions, an overall association rule mining (ARM) analysis would be limited in yielding important associations. Therefore, we developed a 2-step approach to identifying patterns ofmultimorbidity first using a cluster analysis to identify chronic conditions that cluster together and then using ARM to investigate patterns within these clusters more closely. We first used a hierarchical agglomerative clustering approach to create dendrograms that clearly displayed diseases that are associated at different levels or branches of the tree. A binary distance measure was used to produce the distance matrix resulting in more distinctive clusters compared with other proximity measures. We used the Ward method for the dendrogram analysis because this method aims to find compact clusters and minimizes the variance within clusters37 compared with single linkage and average linkage methods, which successively chained observational into 1 cluster.21 Possible clustering solutions were considered to determine the number of clusters to extract, and we used 3 clusters because they gave enough power for ARM analysis within each cluster. We then conducted ARM within each cluster, restricting the maximum number of mined associations to 30 to facilitate clear visualization of the patterns because increasing the number of association rules made the visualizations too complicated but did not change the overall patterns. We made use of the 3 commonly used measurement ratios: support (how frequently the disease combinations appear in the data set), confidence (the conditional probability that a participant who has the antecedent disease will also have the consequent disease), and lift (the ratio of the observed support to that expected if the 2 events were independent). Lift measures the importance of a rule within ARM and, therefore, was considered the main measure of significance in the study. A lift of more than 1 indicates that the antecedent conditions and the consequent conditions appear more often together than expected, which can be interpreted as the antecedent having a positive effect on occurrence of the consequent. A lift of less than 1 indicates that the antecedent and consequent conditions appear less often than expected, which means that the occurrence of the antecedent has a negative effect on the occurrence of the consequent, and a lift close to 1 indicates that the antecedentand the consequent conditions occur as often together as expected, meaning that occurrence of the antecedent has little or no effect on occurrence of the consequent conditions. Hence, the higher the lift, the higher the chance of co-occurrence of the consequent with the antecedent and the more significant the association.

Impaired cardiovascular function may cause cognitive decline by inhibiting cerebrovascular blood flow (called ‘neurovascular coupling’9) possibly leading to hypoperfusion and the amyloid beta plaques that characterize Alzheimer’s disease (AD).9,10 Some authors have suggested that the association may reflect reverse causation due to people with poorer cognitive function being less likely to adopt health-promoting lifestyles.2,11 While this may be the case, longitudinal data have also shown cardiometabolic diseases to be associated with subsequent decline in cognition over time.8 While it is established that individual cardiometabolic diseases are associated with non-demented cognitive ability,12 it is unknown whether there is an additive effect from having more than one disease.

The association with cardiometabolic disease count was broadly linearly additive for reasoning scores and log memory errors, and potentially multiplicative for log reaction time slowing. The negative association with these cognitive measures was independent of age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational level, adverse lifestyle risk factors and comorbid depression.

A wide range of factors was associated with a higher likelihood of PSA testing including age, height, education level, family history of prostate cancer, black ethnic origin, not being in paid/self-employment, living with a wife or partner, having had a vasectomy, being diagnosed with cancer or hypertension and having a high dietary intake of cereal, cooked and salad/raw vegetables, fresh fruit and tea. Conversely, socioeconomic deprivation, Asian ethnic origin, current smoking, low alcohol intake, high body-mass index, high coffee consumption and being diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease or stroke were associated with a lower likelihood of PSA testing.  Conclusions A variety of sociodemographic, lifestyle and health-related characteristics are associated with PSA testing, suggesting that observed associations of some of these traits with risk for prostate cancer in epidemiological studies may be, at least partially, due to detection bias.""",Partially,"Very short with only 5 references ""The only well-established lifestyle and demographic risk factors for prostate cancer are advanced age, being of black ethnic origin and having a family history of the disease. A wide range of other sociodemographic, behavioural, dietary and health-related characteristics have also been reported to be associated with increased prostate cancer risk [1], although these findings are less well established between studies and across populations. This inconsistency may, in part, be due to detection bias if these characteristics are also associated with the likelihood of having had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, which is a key part of the diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer.  Enhanced detection through PSA testing largely explains the increased incidence of prostate cancer over the last 20 years in many countries [2], [3]. In the UK, although PSA testing is not currently recommended as a screening tool for prostate cancer [4], it is widely performed in primary care, either as a frontline test for men presenting with urinary tract/prostatic symptoms or as a free test for men aged ≥50 years at the request of the patient [5].

Improving both CRF and muscle strength, as opposed to either of the two alone, may be the most effective behavioral strategy to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk.""",Yes,"""Low cardio-respiratory fitness (CRF) is a strong predictor of numerous health outcomes, including mortality, not only in general adult populations [1] but also in obese [2], hypertensive [3, 4], or diabetic [5] adults. Poor muscular strength, another component of fitness, has also been indicated as an important marker of mortality [6, 7] as well as adverse health outcomes such as frailty and sarcopenia [8]. Recent clinical trials [9,10,11,12] have demonstrated that compared with improving either CRF or muscle strength alone, improving both CRF and muscle strength simultaneously led to more favorable changes on intermediate cardio-metabolic risk factors and functional status; these intermediate outcomes are important predictors for clinical end-points [13, 14]. However, the prior clinical trials [9,10,11,12] did not include clinical end-points, and it would, in fact, be nearly impossible to establish clinical trials with sufficient statistical power to do so. In contrast, large-scale prospective observational studies can provide such evidence. However, a few observational studies evaluating combined impacts of CRF and muscle strength in relation to mortality risk merely included data from highly select populations of men (i.e. men who were either hypertensive [15] or adolescent [16] at baseline). This limitation precludes the ability to draw robust conclusions for general adult populations of men and women. Given that current public health guidelines [17] recommend that men and women engage in both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities across the whole lifespan, it is critical from clinical and public health standpoints to examine the combined impacts of CRF and muscle strength for mortality risk for a broader adult population.""",Yes,"""However, a few observational studies evaluating combined impacts of CRF and muscle strength in relation to mortality risk merely included data from highly select populations of men (i.e. men who were either hypertensive [15] or adolescent [16] at baseline).

The risk categorization determined allocation to an individualized exercise protocol (S2 Material in Appendix), a methodology aimed at increasing the number of participants with exposure information whilst at the same time reducing the likelihood that participants experience any adverse medical events during the exercise test. Individuals with ‘minimal risk’ (n = 72,715) and ‘small risk’ (n = 11,257) carried out standard bike protocols, which consisted of (1) an initial 15-s seated-rest period, (2) a 2-min phase at constant power (30 watts for women; 40 watts for men), (3) a 4-min ramp phase with linear increases in power from their initial constant power to their individually assigned peak power (to 50 and 35% of predicted maximal workload for ‘minimal’ and ‘small’ risk, respectively), and (4) a 1-min recovery period. Individuals with ‘medium risk’ (n = 2812) cycled at the constant power level for 6 min. Participants were asked to cycle at 60 revolutions-per-minute (RPM) during all cycling phases. Individuals in the ‘high’ risk (n = 11,162) category only did a 2-min seated-rest assessment and were excluded from this analysis, as were those ‘ineligible’ for electrocardiograph testing (n = 1481).  Participants’ electrocardiograms were recorded at 500 Hz with a 4-lead electrocardiograph device (CAM-USB 6.5, Cardiosoft v6.51; two electrocardiograph electrodes on each upper limb) throughout the full test. The electrocardiograph signal was processed using the PhysioNet Toolkit [23] implementation of the SQRS algorithm [24], which applies a digital filter to the signal and identifies the distinctive downward slopes of QRS complexes. The resultant inter-beat-intervals were converted to beats-per-minute values, using “ihr” of the PhysioNet Toolkit [25] (restricting beat-to-beat heart rate changes to ≤ 10 bpm), after which linear interpolation was applied to derive heart rate at 1-s resolution. In addition, we implemented data cleaning and quality control procedures (S3 Material in Appendix). Linear regression was performed to predict workload from heart rate (S4 Material in Appendix); the established linear relationship was then extrapolated to age-predicted maximum heart rate [26] to estimate an individual’s maximal power (watts) as an indicator of CRF. Consolidation procedures were applied to obtain the most robust CRF estimate (S5 Material in Appendix). To account for differences in body size, CRF was expressed as maximal power per fat-free mass (kg) (i.e. body mass–fat mass), the latter measured using bio-impedance analysis (Tanita BC-418MA). Individuals with heart rate missing for > 2 min (50%) during the ramp phase (n = 116) or with maximum power of 0 (n = 156; a sign of the cycle ergometer/ECG acquisition system malfunctioning) or outliers with > 20 watts/fat-free mass (n = 41) were excluded from analyses.  Grip strength GS was assessed once in each hand using a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Jamar J00105), which can measure isometric grip force and was calibrated by staff at the start of each measurement day. Each participant grasped the handle of the device in their right hand while sitting upright on a chair with their forearm on the armrest, and whilst maintaining a 90° angle of their elbow, squeezed the handle as strongly as possible for about 3 s. The same protocol was undertaken with the left hand. GS measures have good reliability and reproducibility [27]. For the current primary analysis, values from the two hands were averaged if available; otherwise, the value from a single hand was used in a small subsample (n = 204). Values of GS (kg) were also divided by fat-free mass (kg) to account for differences in body size.""",NA,Not used,Yes,"""Covariates The following variables were included as covariates in the analyses: sex, waist circumference (centimeters), ethnicity (White, mixed, Asian/Asian British, Black/Black British, other), smoking status (never, previous, current), employment (unemployed, employed), Townsend Deprivation Index (a composite score of employment, car ownership, home ownership and household overcrowding; based on postcode, with higher values indicating a higher degree of deprivation), alcohol consumption (never, previously, currently < 3 times/week, currently ≥ 3 times/week), processed/red meat consumption (days/week), beta-blocker use (yes, no), hypertension, and diabetes.

Individuals with ‘minimal risk’ (n = 72,715) and ‘small risk’ (n = 11,257) carried out standard bike protocols, which consisted of (1) an initial 15-s seated-rest period, (2) a 2-min phase at constant power (30 watts for women; 40 watts for men), (3) a 4-min ramp phase with linear increases in power from their initial constant power to their individually assigned peak power (to 50 and 35% of predicted maximal workload for ‘minimal’ and ‘small’ risk, respectively), and (4) a 1-min recovery period. Individuals with ‘medium risk’ (n = 2812) cycled at the constant power level for 6 min. Participants were asked to cycle at 60 revolutions-per-minute (RPM) during all cycling phases. Individuals in the ‘high’ risk (n = 11,162) category only did a 2-min seated-rest assessment and were excluded from this analysis, as were those ‘ineligible’ for electrocardiograph testing (n = 1481).

A large body of evidence has shown that greater levels of physical activity are associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer (WCRF-AICR, 2011; Moore et al, 2016). However, colorectal cancers are a heterogeneous collection of tumours with variable molecular characteristics, and it is hypothesised that tumours located at different anatomical subsites may have distinct aetiological risk factors (Wei et al, 2004; Limsui et al, 2010). For physical activity, generally consistent inverse relationships have been found for colon and rectal cancers, with a recent participant-level pooled analysis, which included 1.44 million participants, reporting that leisure-time physical activity was associated with lower risks of colon cancer and rectal cancer when analysed separately (Moore et al, 2016). It is unclear, however, how physical activity levels are related to colon cancer risk across the proximal and distal anatomical regions as few studies have been of sufficient size to undertake analyses by subsite, and inconsistent results have emerged. For instance, in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), an inverse relationship was reported only between total physical activity and proximal colon cancer risk, but null results were found for distal colon cancer risk (Friedenreich et al, 2006). In contrast, in other large prospective studies, inverse relationships of similar magnitude have been observed across the colonic subsites (Howard et al, 2008; Burón Pust et al, 2017; Wei et al, 2017).  Sedentary behaviours, defined as sitting or reclined posture activities which expend ⩽1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) (Owen et al, 2000), may also influence colorectal cancer risk. In the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP Diet and Health Study, sedentary behaviour (time spent watching television and videos) was associated with a greater colorectal cancer risk (Howard et al, 2008). A meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies reported that total sitting time, television viewing time, and occupational sitting time were all positively associated with colon cancer development (Schmid and Leitzmann, 2014). However, whether this relationship differs within the colon for proximal and distal tumours has been largely unstudied.""",Yes,"""However, whether this relationship differs within the colon for proximal and distal tumours has been largely unstudied.""",Yes,"""In the current analysis, we investigated how total physical activity levels and sedentary behaviours, such as television watching and time spent using computers, are related to colorectal cancer risk in the UK Biobank study.

Questions are listed in Supplementary Table 1 and are available to view on the UK Biobank Web site (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/label.cgi?id=100054). The questions captured the frequency and duration of three different levels of activity (walking, moderate, and vigorous). Participants were asked on how many days in a typical week they engaged in each activity level for 10 min or more. For each level in which an answer of one or more days was given, the participant was then asked how many minutes they usually spent doing that activity on a typical day. Using this information, METs were used to quantify the intensity of physical activity. The MET values represent the ratio of energy expended per kilogram of body weight per hour to the standard resting metabolic rate (Ainsworth et al, 2011). The number of days per week that participants engaged in each level of physical activity was multiplied by the number of minutes spent per day doing that activity. This gave the total number of minutes spent per week engaged in each activity category. Total MET values for each category from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form were: 3.3 for walking, 4.0 for moderate physical activity and 8.0 for vigorous physical activity (IPAQ Research Committee, 2005). We report excess METs, which are calculated by subtracting one MET from the value for each activity, and represent the energy expenditure above that of an inactive person (Howley, 2001). Excess MET values were therefore 2.3 for walking, 3.0 for moderate physical activity and 7.0 for vigorous physical activity. Excess MET-hours per week were calculated by multiplying the excess MET value for each activity by the duration of activity in hours per week (IPAQ Research Committee, 2005). In the baseline questionnaire, participants were also asked in a typical day how many hours they spent watching television and using a computer.

Both instruments require several questions to estimate circadian preference or chronotype, while the UK Biobank participants rated their chronotype through the answer to a single question. However, this question is practically identical to the final question of the MEQ, which has been found to have the highest correlation (ρ=.89) to the total MEQ score (Adan and Almirall, 1991), which suggests that misclassification may have been minimal.

We assigned 1 point to participants for each unhealthy category (current smoker; alcohol consumed daily or almost daily; <150 min per week of moderate intensity physical activity or <75 min per week of vigorous intensity physical activity; ≥4 h per day of television viewing time; <7 h or >9 h of sleep per day; <400 g of fruits and vegetables per day; less than one portion of oily fish per week; more than three portions of red meat per week; more than one portion of processed meat per week). Participants' points were summed to create an unweighted score. The minimum score was 0, indicating a healthier lifestyle, and the maximum score was 9, indicating an unhealthier lifestyle. To examine the associations of lifestyle with health outcomes, participants were classified into three categories according to their lifestyle score. Participants who scored 0, 1, or 2 were classed as most healthy; those who scored 3, 4, or 5 were classed as moderately healthy; and those who scored 6, 7, 8, or 9 were classed as least healthy. Distributions of the lifestyle score and lifestyle categories are shown in the appendix.""",No,,NA,,Yes,"""Significant interactions between lifestyle category and deprivation were found for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality (both pinteraction<0·0001) but not for cardiovascular disease incidence (pinteraction=0·11; figure; appendix).""",Yes,"""Sensitivity analyses using the traditional score showed the same pattern; however, for individuals in the least healthy category, HRs for all outcomes across all levels of deprivation were lower with the traditional score than with the extended score (appendix).""",NA,,Yes,"""Our findings show that an extended score of unhealthy lifestyle factors—incorporating the emerging risk factors of sleep duration and television viewing time together with more traditional lifestyle factors of smoking, alcohol, physical activity, and diet—has a strong association with all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular disease mortality and incidence. We found that the association between an unhealthy lifestyle and all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality becomes stronger with increasing levels of deprivation. This disproportionate lifestyle-associated risk in more deprived groups was seen with both area-level and individual-level measures of socioeconomic status. Furthermore, this risk was even greater in more deprived groups when lifestyle was measured by an extended score that included emerging factors than by a traditional score. These inequalities in lifestyle-related risk were not accounted for by differences in sex, age, ethnicity, blood pressure, concurrent cholesterol or blood pressure medication, or body-mass index. The steeper all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality trends (figure) across lifestyle categories in more deprived groups support a vulnerability hypothesis whereby deprived groups are more vulnerable to the effects of unhealthy lifestyles than are groups that are not deprived.6,  20 According to this hypothesis, deprived groups are likely to experience disproportionate harm from unhealthy lifestyles, which is not simply explained by greater prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles.""",Yes,"""Presence of a non-communicable disease at baseline and therefore exclusion from the final survival models was based on self-report; therefore, misreporting might have biased results. However, misreporting might be less likely because diagnosis was based on a physician's diagnosis and was discussed at interview with a trained nurse. Self-reported lifestyle data are prone to healthy reporting bias,28 and there were much larger numbers of participants in the moderately healthy and most healthy lifestyle categories (table 1; appendix), consistent with a misreporting phenomenon. Misreporting might have affected the associations described here if there were systematic differences in misreporting between affluent and deprived groups. Although evidence for a socioeconomic gradient of healthy recall bias is scarce, there might be more misreporting of lifestyle behaviours generally among more deprived groups than among affluent groups.29 Increased misreporting of lifestyle behaviours in deprived groups would flatten the associations between lifestyle and health outcomes among the deprived group, suggesting that the associations identified here would be even stronger with more accurate reporting. The lifestyle score used assumes the same level of risk associated with each component lifestyle factor.14 However, HRs varied by individual factor (appendix). Applying weighting for the risk associated with each component could produce different results. Moreover, identification of specific high-risk permutations or combinations of lifestyle factors, although not practical here (768 possible permutations for the nine lifestyle factors examined in this study), could help to identify high-risk groups in future research. The manner in which data were collected resulted in crude categories for some factors. For example, alcohol consumption daily or almost daily defined the unhealthy behaviour category, which might erroneously include low-risk drinkers and thereby reduce the association of alcohol consumption with adverse outcomes.""",No,,Yes,"""In conclusion, this study is, to our knowledge, the first to highlight the disproportionate risk associated with a broad range of unhealthy lifestyle factors among more deprived socioeconomic groups. If this association is causal, policies to improve a broad range of lifestyle factors among these groups could lead to substantial improvements in health outcomes. This improvement in health outcomes would not only come about because of the higher prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles in deprived areas than in affluent areas but also because those in deprived areas appear to be more vulnerable to the deleterious effects of unhealthy lifestyle factors, including emerging factors such as sleep duration and television viewing time, than those in affluent areas. However, improvement of specific lifestyle factors alone in areas of deprivation is unlikely to reduce health inequalities. On the basis of the increased vulnerability seen in this study, deprived populations would continue to have worse outcomes despite similar levels of unhealthy lifestyle factors seen in affluent populations. This finding clearly strengthens the arguments for government policies that tackle upstream determinants of ill-health and aim to reduce poverty, and for health policies that offer increased support in areas of deprivation.22,  23,  25 Public health and individual-level interventions should aim to improve wider combinations of lifestyle factors but need to recognise and address the social and environmental determinants of lifestyle to avoid increasing health inequalities.30 Further research is required to understand the mechanisms behind the interaction between lifestyle and deprivation, as well as to identify those combinations of unhealthy lifestyle factors that incur the greatest risk across socioeconomic groups.""",Yes,"""UK Biobank is acknowledged to have a low response rate (5%), with participants being more affluent and more likely to be from a white ethnic background than the UK population as a whole.

Whereas this may potentially protect against early mortality, it may have negative sequelae in later life, including susceptibility to some chronic diseases.7  Low birth weight and MDD A recent meta-analysis which pooled assessments of the association between low birth weight and risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) derived in 18 separate studies, comprising a total of 59 442 participants, did not find evidence for an association once publication bias was taken into account.2 The authors noted significant heterogeneity between studies, including wide age ranges of participants, different outcome measures, inadequate follow-up rates and low power.

We were also able to assess the associations between birth weight and neuroticism scores, and risk of BD in adulthood.

There were clear trends whereby the risk of all three increased with reducing birth weight, from normal to very low. Tests of mediation showed that the association between birth weight and MDD was partially mediated by its association with neuroticism.  We found a significant association between low birth weight and higher neuroticism, which survived adjustment for relevant covariates. There was a significant dose effect, such that lower birth weight was associated with higher neuroticism in adulthood (i.e. very low>low>normal). The birth weight/neuroticism associations were characterised by relatively small effect sizes: around a 0.20–0.30 increase in neuroticism scores (out of 12) for low/very low v. normal birth weight. Given the large sample size, statistical significance may not be clinically meaningful, in terms of being a risk factor for MDD/BD.  We found a significant association between low/very low birth weight and increased risk of MDD. This survived adjustment for potential confounding variables and physical disorder history. There appeared to be dose effect, with lower birth weight being associated with higher MDD rates. We found a similar dose effect association for BD. When we separately contrasted very low and low birth weight categories with normal birth weight, we found a significant association between very low birth weight and risk of BD in the unadjusted and confounder- but not mediator-adjusted model (i.e. additionally corrected for physical disorders). Note that sample sizes for the BD analyses were relatively small, and this may contribute to non-significant P-values where the relevant effect sizes are similar or even stronger than in the MDD results.""",Yes,"""The birth weight data in UK Biobank were obtained by asking the participants to recall it in late adulthood. Whereas actual recorded data would be preferable as recall will be subject to inherent noise/error – Inskip et al 24 showed that Bland-Altman plots revealed reasonable agreement between the recalled weight (at assessment) and recorded (hospital record-based) birth weights in 1729 women (Spearman rank r=0.87), although this was in young women. This nonetheless suggests that recalled birth weight is reasonably accurate; when people can recall their birth weight, their recall is quite good, but many, of course, were excluded from these analyses as their birth weight was unknown. It is possible that certain recall biases influence our final results; for example, perhaps participants with chronic illnesses are more likely to recall information such as maternal depression or smoking. There was a significant association between likelihood of reporting birth weight (v. not) and probable MDD/BD; however, this was modest.  The present study corrects for several limitations compared with the recent meta-analysis. However, there are additional variables that were not accounted for, including gestational age, maternal socioeconomic status and pregnancy-related complications such as preterm birth. The classification of probable MDD/BD was based on self-report data which may be subject to under-reporting. The current study does not take into account genetic factors that may contribute to low birth weight or mood disorder, potentially important variables such as parent's socioeconomic status, or whether parent's attitudes or behaviours are different for children with low birth weight. We did not control for multiple births which may contribute to the prevalence of low birth weight in the sample; however, we are not aware of multiple pregnancies being a risk factor for MDD/neuroticism independent of any effect of low birth weight, and it therefore might not act as a confounder.  Participants with lifetime histories of depression may have been less likely to participate in UK Biobank research, and this may interact with other variables such as lower socioeconomic status; the sample may not be entirely representative of psychiatric disease prevalence in a range of different backgrounds. Additionally, developmental problems (such as low birth weight) may result in a bias where the most impaired participants do not reach older age or participate in research. We found a small but significant bias where participants who reported birth weight data had higher prevalence of MDD. This may reflect a degree of selection bias where the participants that did not report birth weight data may have a weaker weight/MDD association, which may partly attenuate the relatively modest associations reported here.""",Partially,"hint that any bias might be small based on their sensitivity analysis results  ""It is possible that certain recall biases influence our final results; for example, perhaps participants with chronic illnesses are more likely to recall information such as maternal depression or smoking.

We employed a theoretically- and behaviourally-relevant definition of residential ‘neighbourhood’ [45], which also has precedent for use [31, 39] however which may not match the neighbourhood perceptions or align with the food purchasing behaviours of individuals in this study, and which may have resulted in exposure misclassification. While residential location constitutes an important daily anchor point [69], ensuring relevance of assessing neighbourhood food outlet exposure around this location, we could not assess exposure to the food environment within wider activity spaces [70]. That said, research has shown that magnitude of non-residential neighbourhood food outlet exposure is unrelated to that of residential exposure [71, 72], resulting in random error (not bias) that would have likely served to attenuate our parameter estimates towards the null [73]. UK Biobank data was collected 2006–2010, with neighbourhood food exposure metrics derived from 2012 UKMap data [44]. This resulted in temporal mismatch, although grouping exposure estimates into quarters is likely to have reduced the impact of misclassification. Further misclassification may have emerged from use of UKMap data, which is of unknown completeness, including how this may vary geographically. We used frequency of processed meat consumption as a proxy for fast-food intake, however, while fast-food outlets are likely to be an important source of these types of foods, such processed foods could be obtained from non-fast-food outlets [74]. Moreover, UK Biobank had only limited detail of dietary intakes, with no information on total diet, energy intake or portion sizes of food and drink consumed. Thus we could estimate only frequency of processed meat consumption, but not total amount. We used household income as our marker of socioeconomic status, in lieu of other markers including educational attainment and occupational social class, which are both imperfectly correlated with income [75]. Our results may be sensitive to the selection of income as our marker of SEP, however, given that findings were consistent with those of a similar study that used education as a marker of socioeconomic status [39], this appears unlikely.

Of that number, 33,437 participants reported taking calcium supplements; 19,089 vitamin D; and 10,007 both. In crude and adjusted analyses, there were no associations between use of calcium supplements and risk of incident hospital admission with either IHD, or subsequent death. Thus, for example, in unadjusted models, the hazard ratio (HR) for admission with myocardial infarction was 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79–1.20, p = 0.79) among women taking calcium supplementation. Corresponding HR for men is 1.16 (95% CI 0.92–1.46, p = 0.22). After full adjustment, HR (95% CI) were 0.82 (0.62–1.07), p = 0.14 among women and 1.12 (0.85–1.48), p = 0.41 among men. Adjusted HR (95% CI) for admission with IHD were 1.05 (0.92–1.19), p = 0.50 among women and 0.97 (0.82–1.15), p = 0.77 among men. Results were similar for vitamin D and combination supplementation. There were no associations with death, and in women, further adjustment for hormone‐replacement therapy use did not alter the associations.""",Yes,"""Calcium supplementation given with or without vitamin D supplementation is widely used, particularly in the elderly, and has been shown to modestly reduce the risk of new fragility fracture,1 particularly in those older individuals in residential care.2 Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is given routinely as adjunctive therapy with anti‐osteoporosis medications, all of which are licensed to be taken in the context of calcium and vitamin D repletion.3 Calcium supplementation either alone or in combination with vitamin D was viewed as extremely safe, other than gastrointestinal side effects and a slightly increased risk of renal stones,4 until a publication in the BMJ by Bolland and colleagues in 2008. In this New Zealand‐based trial of calcium supplementation in older women, increased risk of myocardial infarction with calcium supplementation was demonstrated.5 Subsequent meta‐analyses and a reanalysis of the Women's Health Initiative trial by the same group again demonstrated modest associations between calcium, or calcium and vitamin D, supplementation and increased risk of myocardial infarction but not cardiovascular death.6, 7 In contrast, no statistically significant associations between calcium and vitamin D supplementation and cardiac outcomes were found in a similar meta‐analysis by Lewis and colleagues8 or by investigators studying the Women's Health Initiative.9, 10, 11 However, in the Lewis study, a subanalysis among the much smaller number of individuals randomized to calcium alone did suggest an increased risk of myocardial infarction with use of calcium supplements alone versus placebo. Observational cohort data have led to similarly conflicting findings,(12–18) particularly with regard to dietary calcium intake compared with supplement use. More recently, work has documented differences in the endothelial response to prevailing calcium concentration between healthy and uremic patients,(19–21) and novel Mendelian randomization approaches have indicated an association between lifelong genetically determined calcium concentrations and ischemic heart disease.22, 23 """,Yes,"""Given the high incidence of osteoporotic fracture,24 cardiovascular side effects of treatments used to improve bone health, such as calcium/vitamin D supplementation, could potentially have major implications for public health.25 Across the intervention and observational data, there is substantial heterogeneity among both exposure and outcome definitions, and there is a marked dearth of evidence pertaining to men.""",Yes,"""We, therefore, undertook a study of sex‐specific associations between calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation and risk of hospitalization for ischemic heart disease, or subsequent mortality in a very large, population‐based cohort of men and women with uniform ascertainment of both exposure and outcomes: the UK Biobank.

Over a median follow-up of 4.9 years (range 3.3–7.8 years), 6,209 died (594 as a result of CVD), and 4,301 developed CVD. Participants with diabetes were at higher risk of all-cause and CVD mortality and CVD incidence. Significant interactions (P < 0.05) existed whereby the risk of CVD mortality was higher in participants with diabetes with low (hazard ratio [HR] 4.05 [95% CI 2.72, 5.80]) versus high (HR 1.46 [0.87, 2.46]) grip strength.

This loss of muscle mass and function appears to be accelerated in people with type 2 diabetes. A cross-sectional analysis of data from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (485 adults 70–79 years of age with type 2 diabetes and 2,133 without) showed that people with type 2 diabetes have lower leg (men only) and grip strength (3) and that after 6 years’ follow-up, they lose leg but not grip strength at a greater rate than healthy counterparts of comparable age (4,5).""",Yes,"""Prior research reported that within a group of people (mean age 63.6 years) with impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes (n = 12,516), a higher grip strength is associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (10), reflecting the findings observed in general population studies. This analysis was, however, only adjusted for BMI, waist circumference, and hip circumference and not for wider lifestyle factors and had no comparison of this relationship with that of people without diabetes.

Dietary information was collected in a subset of participants (n = 157,223 with dietary and diabetes data available) through the Oxford WebQ, a Web-based 24-h recall questionnaire developed specifically as a low-cost instrument for assessing diet in large-scale prospective studies. Compared with 24-h dietary recall, the mean Spearman correlation of the 21 nutrients obtained from the WebQ was 0.6, with the majority between 0.5 and 0.9 (16).

Number of years with diabetes was derived from self-reported age at the assessment visit and age when diabetes was diagnosed. History of recent medication for diabetes (insulin), cholesterol, and hypertension at baseline was collected by self-reported touch screen questionnaire.

Although UK Biobank is not representative of the general population, with evidence of a healthy volunteer selection bias, the valid assessment of exposure-disease relationships may be widely generalizable and does not require participants to be representative of the population at large (31,32). Therefore, caution should be heeded in generalizing summary statistics, such as the prevalence of diabetes and obesity, to the general population. This does not detract from the ability to generalize estimates of the magnitude of associations. The current study benefited from a large number of participants recruited from the general population across the U.K. We had sufficient power to undertake analysis by age and grip strength categories. However, rather than grip strength having a causally protective effect versus mortality or subsequent disease incidence, it may be a marker of generally better health at baseline, and although we attempted to reduce the potential for reverse causality and confounding in our analysis by performing 2-year landmark analysis and excluding individuals with a medical diagnosis of chronic comorbidities at baseline, the potential for both to influence the results remains. Another limitation of the current study is data bias because the study only included people with diabetes who had survived long enough to be recruited into the study, i.e., many people with diabetes who would have been eligible for inclusion in this study will have already died. Diabetes was ascertained by self-report of a physician diagnosis; therefore, incomplete ascertainment is possible but unlikely to introduce a systematic error. In the SHIELD (Study to Help Improve Early evaluation and management of risk factors Leading to Diabetes) screening survey, Bays et al.

We were unable to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but with the exclusion of participants <30 years of age at diagnosis, the overwhelming majority of cases will be type 2 diabetes. Data on physical activity and sedentary behavior was self-reported, which has limitations in accuracy (35) and does not capture specific forms of exercise, such as resistance training, likely to have an effect on the associations we have observed in the current study. In all studies involving nutritional epidemiology, uncertainties always exist in estimating long-term dietary intake, and all methods of dietary assessment can incur both random and systematic errors, the former of which can be diminished but not eliminated by studying large numbers (36,37). In the current study, dietary intake was self-reported outside the clinic, which may encourage more truthful reporting. In addition, online administration of the questionnaires is expected to minimize reporting bias as a result of social desirability. The information was collected by using a 24-h recall questionnaire, which has been shown to produce more accurate results than a food frequency questionnaire (the usual approach adopted in large-scale studies) (38).""",Yes,"""This study has several strengths and limitations.

Data on physical activity and sedentary behavior was self-reported, which has limitations in accuracy (35) and does not capture specific forms of exercise, such as resistance training, likely to have an effect on the associations we have observed in the current study. In all studies involving nutritional epidemiology, uncertainties always exist in estimating long-term dietary intake, and all methods of dietary assessment can incur both random and systematic errors, the former of which can be diminished but not eliminated by studying large numbers (36,37). In the current study, dietary intake was self-reported outside the clinic, which may encourage more truthful reporting. In addition, online administration of the questionnaires is expected to minimize reporting bias as a result of social desirability. The information was collected by using a 24-h recall questionnaire, which has been shown to produce more accurate results than a food frequency questionnaire (the usual approach adopted in large-scale studies) (38).""",Yes,"""The current study shows that the risk of all-cause mortality and CVD incidence and mortality is lower in people with a higher grip strength, both with and without diabetes. The findings suggest that grip strength has clinical utility in identifying people with diabetes at risk for poor health outcomes. Furthermore, targeting interventions such as resistance exercise to people with low grip strength in whom the greatest benefits may be gained could increase clinical effectiveness. These conclusions remain to be tested in future well-designed randomized controlled trials.""",Yes,"""Although UK Biobank is not representative of the general population, with evidence of a healthy volunteer selection bias, the valid assessment of exposure-disease relationships may be widely generalizable and does not require participants to be representative of the population at large (31,32).

Those taking neuropathic pain medications and CM drugs also demonstrate worse CM profile than those taking CM drugs only.""",Yes,"""Obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes represent significant personal, societal and economic burden [1,2]. The inter-relationship between metabolic and cardiovascular disease is termed cardio-metabolic (CM) health. Those with both CVD and type 2 diabetes have a particularly poor prognosis and require aggressive risk factor intervention [3]. Obesity now affects 34.9% of all US adults and 26% of UK adults with a greater than doubling of the prevalence over the last 30 years [4].""",Partially,"""The increased use of opioid medication has led to increasing recognition of their side effects when used chronically and the use of long term opioid medication has become increasingly controversial with recent, far reaching changes to reduce prescribing in the US [8]. The dangers of addiction, sleep disordered breathing, daytime sedation and accidental overdose are well known and researched [9]. The impact of opioids upon appetite, metabolism and the insulin axis is less well studied [10]. More recently cohort studies have suggested that those using chronic opiate prescriptions in particular have an increased mortality rate from all causes but there may be many confounding factors when studying those with chronic pain and the reasons for this association remain debated [11].  Weight gain with neuropathic pain meds is described but often in small studies looking at the impact upon the first 6–12 weeks of prescription [12,13]. There have been few large studies addressing the potential association between commonly prescribed analgesic drugs and CM health. However, smaller studies following patients prescribed gabapentin, pregabilin, amitriptyline have shown increased BMI in those followed up between periods of 3–6 months. Weight gain is cited as one of the commonest reasons for discontinuing these medications [14]. Opiates have been shown to cause insulin resistance but whether they clearly cause weight gain over time remains debated [10]. Many of the analgesic drugs cause sedation and increase the risk of sleep disordered breathing. Sleep disturbance in itself causes insulin resistance with increasing recognition of the association between sleep and circadian rhythm disturbance, worse CM health and increased obesity [15].""",Yes,"""The UK Biobank is a large population-based cohort which allows measurement of commonly used prescription drugs alongside important indicators of CM health, physical activity and lifestyle behaviours [16]. Our primary aim was to assess CM health in those taking commonly prescribed analgesic drugs. Our secondary objective was to further explore associations with lifestyle factors such as physical activity, diet and sleep duration to try and understand the mechanism of any metabolic disturbance.  Given that many participants are prescribed combinations of opiates and neuropathic pain relief, we elected to study those on any combination of prescribed analgesic medication including opiates, antidepressants recommended for chronic pain and the alpha2delta ligands pregabilin and gabapentin. We hypothesized that this group would be more likely to have poor CM health and increased obesity and that this association would persist as an independent risk factor when controlling for other lifestyle factors.""",Yes,"""A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on baseline data from the UK Biobank.""",Partially,"""The UK Biobank is a large, population-based cohort study examining the interrelationships between environment, lifestyle and genes [16].

Co-morbid conditions may impact on the ability of people with an inflammatory RMD to carry out physical activity; however, it is also possible that people with a historically low level of physical activity may be more likely to develop co-morbid conditions. Data on disease activity was not available. However, of six studies that have looked at the association between disease activity and physical activity, only one found a modest association [40]. The response rate for the UK Biobank was 5.5%. Nonetheless, while the UK Biobank cohort may not necessarily be representative of the whole UK population in all respects, internal comparisons of the rates of co-morbidities between people with and without an inflammatory RMD, and internal analysis of the association between co-morbidity and physical activity is valid, given the sufficiently large number of people with different exposures included in this cohort [39, 41, 42].""",Yes,"""In conclusion, patients with chronic inflammatory RMDs have an increased risk of developing chronic co-morbidities compared with the general population. Early detection and optimal management of co-morbid conditions in patients with an inflammatory RMD may help to reduce the impact of the increased co-morbid burden seen in these patients. Patients with an inflammatory RMD should be encouraged to meet physical activity guidelines where possible, which may help to reduce the risk of incident cardiovascular disease.

Of these, 106,053 agreed to wear an Axivity AX3 wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer (44.8%) over a 7-day period. Participants were asked to wear the accelerometer on their dominant wrist continuously while engaging in their normal daily activities, and then return the device. This study used the accelerometry scores which were calculated from the raw accelerometer data with a rigorous data processing procedure, published elsewhere.40 This considered both the time and intensity of PA to maintain the average vector magnitude value over five seconds epochs, thereby providing a summary score representing an average PA level over a given time period. 103,578 participants were included in wear time analysis. Of them, 80.6% of participants wore the device for >150 h out of a scheduled 168 h. 6978 participants (6.7% of sample) who had insufficient device wear time (<72 h) were removed.40 We categorised PA into low, moderate and vigorous intensity. Low intensity PA was defined as time spent in less than 100 milligravities (mg) activity. Moderate and vigorous PA were defined as time spent in 100–400 mg and >400 mg of activity, respectively.41, 42  The UK Biobank participants underwent a cardio-respiratory fitness test which consisted of heart-rate monitoring (using a 4-lead electrocardiograph [ECG]; Cardiosoft v6.51) during cycle ergometry on a stationary bike (eBike, Firmware v1.7) with a ramp slope that is adapted to the individual based on age, gender, weight and medical history. Detailed protocol about cardio-respiratory fitness test has been previously described.43 ECGs were recorded pre-test (15 s), during activity (6 min) and in recovery (1 min). The participant’s risk category was first calculated to determine what level of activity they should perform or have only a resting ECG performed. There were five risk categories: Category 2 consisted of participants who had a heart condition or diastolic blood pressure ≥95 mm of Hg and systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm of Hg; Category 3 had participants who had chest pain during physical activity or missing data on height/heart rate; Category 4 consisted of participants who had chest pain at rest, who were unable to walk/cycle unaided for ten minutes, were pregnant, who had no data on weight, blood pressure, or pacemaker status, had diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mm of Hg and systolic blood pressure ≥180 mm of Hg, or weighed ≥150 kg; Category 5 comprised participants who had a pacemaker; Category 1 consisted of participants who did not belong to any of the above categories. For participants in Categories 1 and 2, their predicted absolute maximum workload was calculated according to age, height, weight, resting heart rate and sex using the following formula:  Absolute  maximum  workload = 105.2749 + (−0.0935 × age) + (−0.0280973 × age × age) + (2.809493 × sex) + (119.0087 × height) + (0.309456 × weight) + (−2.698067 × resting heart  rate) + (0.0090985 × resting  heart  rate × resting  heart  rate) + (−0.3783405 × age × sex) + (60.72548 × height × sex) + (−0.15016 × weight × sex) + (−0.3730664 × resting  heart  rate × sex) + (0.0180811 × resting  heart  rate × age)  The percentage levels of effort during activity were then determined according to their risk category. The target-power was 50% and 30% of the absolute maximum workload for participants in Categories 1 and 2, respectively. For Category 3, participants were instructed to cycle at constant level whereas for Category 4 the protocol dictated that measurement was to be taken only at rest. Lastly, ECG was avoided for Category 5 since it was unsafe or pointless. Participants were instructed to either cycle at a constant workload for 6 min aiming for approximately 60 revolutions per minute, or cycle for the first 2 min at a constant workload, with the pedalling resistance increasing over the last 4 min.""",Yes,"""The location of sites at which the participants experienced pain was measured by self-reported questionnaire.

As the potential to induce vitamin D synthesis varies dramatically with wavelength, only UVB radiation restricted specifically to wavelengths which can induce cutaneous vitamin D production was considered (290–315 nm) and a weighting function was applied (peak synthesis occurs at 295–298 nm) 23.

The mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. The prepubertal linear growth occurs more in the leg than in the trunk (Whitley et al. 2012), and leg length may be a particularly sensitive marker of adverse prepubertal environmental factors that affect growth.

When we only included individuals with Ménière’s on betahistine (n = 599) as cases, we saw similar associations for height (OR, 0.88 [0.81–0.96]) and leg length (OR, 0.92 [0.85–1.00]) per quintile increase""",NA,,Yes,"""Ménière’s was noted to be more prevalent in older, female individuals of white origin, and with higher BMI as previously noted (Sajjadi & Paparella 2008). For the first time, we demonstrated inverse associations existed between Ménière’s and the components of adult height. We also observed that higher IMD scores (representing greater deprivation) for place of birth was associated with increased odds of Ménière’s. The crude results show a similar level of association between the diagnosis of Ménière’s disease and any of the individual components of adult height, that is, total height, leg length, and trunk length. This observation is in accordance with previous research showing that total adult height is associated with lower rates of a number of chronic diseases (Davey Smith et al. 2000) although the physiological mechanisms behind this are not always clear (Bray et al. 2006). After adjusting for potential confounders in the form of age, BMI, CHD, diabetes, ethnicity, sex, smoking, and social class as defined by education, trunk length ceases to be a significant predictor of the diagnosis of Ménière’s disease, and it appears that overall height and leg length are the components of adult height most strongly associated with the disease. This finding is consistent, when tested in all cases and controls, in cases versus age- and sex-matched controls and in a subgroup analysis of women only. In a subgroup analysis of men only, no component of height was found to be a significant predictor of Ménière’s disease after adjustment for confounders.""",Yes,"""We acknowledge some limitations with our data. The disease diagnosis was self-reported; however, people were also able to select vestibular disorder, tinnitus, vertigo, and labyrinthitis which, along with the presence and advice of a trained nurse, should have reduced the number of people incorrectly reporting Ménière’s. Furthermore, the self-reported Ménière’s sufferers had increased odds of Ménière’s-type symptoms and reporting the use of Ménière’s medication and commonly used dietary self-management. It is possible that the people reporting Ménière’s in the UK Biobank are incorrectly diagnosed. Ménière’s is particularly difficult to diagnose in the early stages of the disease. We performed a sensitivity analysis where we excluded individuals diagnosed in the 5 years before recruitment to the UK Biobank, as it is anticipated that in this time frame, newly diagnosed individuals will undergo a range of tests that might suggest misdiagnosis (Sajjadi & Paparella 2008). There may be participants in the UK Biobank who have Meniere’s disease but are not yet diagnosed, but as the prevalence was 0.27% which is similar to prior studies, we believe this number to be small. The recruitment strategy of the UK Biobank meant that it is not a representative sample of the British population (borne out by the under-representation of ethnic minorities), and selection criteria also limit it to the 40- to 70-year-old age range. Volunteer bias may have occurred, with more people with health conditions volunteering than healthy individuals. Healthy participant bias may also operate in the opposing direction with relatively fit people participating, as some travel to recruitment centers were involved (with a large proportion of participants past the retirement age participating). Finally, we used the cross-sectional baseline data of the UK Biobank; however, as we are investigating associations between Ménière’s and height, we can assume that factors contributing to height occurred before the diagnosis of Ménière’s in most individuals. Other unmeasured factors not considered in the analyses may underlie the associations; for example, growth-regulating genes may be independently associated with Ménière’s. Genetics currently explain approximately 12% of the variation in adult height although it is anticipated that more variants will be identified in the future. We were unable to investigate the role of genetics within this study; future work should consider the associations while accounting for known height variants. Alternatively, taller individuals are considered to be more successful in later life (Case & Paxson 2006), and this may protect against Ménière’s rather than some growth-influencing exposure. Our previous work suggested an inverse association between educational attainment and Ménière’s (Tyrrell et al. 2014a). We were also unable to account for changes in height due to aging. However, age-related changes in height are predominantly attributed to shrinkage of the trunk, and therefore, our findings for leg length, the well-defined marker of an adverse childhood environment, will not be altered (Fernihough & McGovern 2014), suggesting that our findings are accurate.""",Partially,"For some forms of bias only  ""Healthy participant bias may also operate in the opposing direction with relatively fit people participating, as some travel to recruitment centers were involved (with a large proportion of participants past the retirement age participating). """,Yes,"""This study demonstrated robust associations between Ménière’s and the components of adult height, with consistent associations with leg length after adjusting for various confounders. The specific association between leg length and Ménière’s may suggest that early-life environmental exposures that influence skeletal growth also influence Ménière’s risk in later life. This is feasible as factors that influence skeletal growth are likely to impact on the development of the nervous and immune systems, both of which are implicated in Ménière’s etiology (Tyrrell et al. 2014a). This finding may not be clinically relevant for the treatment of Ménière’s, but our analyses support the importance of the childhood environment (e.g., good nutrition, low burden of disease) in the growth and development of a healthy neurosensory system.""",Yes,"""The recruitment strategy of the UK Biobank meant that it is not a representative sample of the British population (borne out by the under-representation of ethnic minorities), and selection criteria also limit it to the 40- to 70-year-old age range.

The Cronbach alpha coefficient for these items has been reported elsewhere as 0.62,14 and the task shows reasonable reliability across on average 4.3 years in 4253 participants with repeat data (r = 0.65, P <0.001). The next task was a visual memory test called pairs matching (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/label.cgi?id=100030), where participants were asked to memorize the positions of six card pairs, and then match them from memory while making as few errors as possible. We refer to this test as the memory task from here on. Scores on the memory test are for the number of errors that each participant made, and higher scores are, therefore, worse. The memory test did not show good reliability in 19 017 participants with longitudinal data (r = 0.16, P <0.001); however, this may partly be due to slight floor effects where most participants made few-to-no errors on repeat assessment, and it will be a more informative test variable when measured at baseline. Finally, participants completed a timed test, measured in milliseconds, of symbol matching; similar to the common card game Snap (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=20023) which we refer to as reaction time.

Accelerometer data processing Raw accelerometry data were calibrated to local gravity (1 g) with temperature compensation17 and filtered to dampen machine noise using a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20 Hz. Euclidean Norm Minus One was calculated as the Euclidean Norm (vector magnitude) of the acceleration in three axes minus one gravitational unit (1 g), with any negative values truncated to zero. Non-wear was identified as time periods of ⩾60 min where standard deviations of all three axes were <13.0 milli-g (1 milli-g=0.001 g). Overall PA volume (average Euclidean Norm Minus One) and intensity distribution (5-sec resolution) were summarised for each individual activity record, while minimising diurnal bias caused by non-wear.24 Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was defined as Euclidean Norm Minus One values greater than 125 milli-g, and expressed in min day−1.

The device has good reliability and reproducibility.21 Staff calibrated the device at the start of each measurement day. Each participant was asked to sit upright on a chair with their forearm on the armrest, and then grasp the handle of the device in their right hand. They were required to maintain a 90° angle of their elbow adjacent to their side so that their thumb would face upwards, while squeezing the handle as strongly as possible for ~3 s. The same protocol was performed with the left hand. For the current analysis, we used average values of the two hands; unless the value from only one hand was available (n=233). Sex- and age-specific quintiles of GS were generated for analyses (Supplementary Table 1).  Adiposity measures Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing measured weight (kg) by measured height squared (m2). Waist circumference (WC) was measured by a tape measure at the level of the umbilicus. For the present analyses, BMI (kg m−2) was categorised as normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9), obesity class I (30.0–34.9) and obesity class II (⩾35.0). A total of 62 men and 373 women who were underweight (BMI<18.5 kg m−2) were excluded from the analyses because of small sample size.

However, sensitivity analyses using other cut points (for example, 100 milli-g and 150 milli-g) revealed almost identical patterns of associations as compared with the results with 125 milli-g. Nonetheless, calibration and cross-validation research is needed to develop a wrist methodology that can most accurately assess PA. In addition, the lack of measurements of body composition and GS at follow-up, and accelerometer measurements at baseline in the UK Biobank study prevented investigating the role of change in these characteristics as determinants of objectively measured PA.

Design Prospective population based study.  Setting UK Biobank.  Participants 502 293 participants (54% women) aged 40-69 years.

In women and men, respectively, hazard ratios per 5 kg lower grip strength were higher (all at P<0.05) for all cause mortality (1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.23, and 1.16, 1.15 to 1.17) and cause specific mortality from cardiovascular disease (1.19, 1.13 to 1.25, and 1.22, 1.18 to 1.26), all respiratory disease (1.31, 1.22 to 1.40, and 1.24, 1.20 to 1.28), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.24, 1.05 to 1.47, and 1.19, 1.09 to 1.30), all cancer (1.17, 1.13 to 1.21, 1.10, 1.07 to 1.13), colorectal cancer (1.17, 1.04 to 1.32, and 1.18, 1.09 to 1.27), lung cancer (1.17, 1.07 to 1.27, and 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), and breast cancer (1.24, 1.10 to 1.39) but not prostate cancer (1.05, 0.96 to 1.15). Several of these relations had higher hazard ratios in the younger age group. Muscle weakness (defined as grip strength <26 kg for men and <16 kg for women) was associated with a higher hazard for all health outcomes, except colon cancer in women and prostate cancer and lung cancer in both men and women. The addition of handgrip strength improved the prediction ability, based on C index change, of an office based risk score (age, sex, diabetes diagnosed, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and smoking) for all cause (0.013) and cardiovascular mortality (0.012) and incidence of cardiovascular disease (0.009).""",Yes,"""Many studies have shown that lower muscle function is associated with greater mortality and morbidity.567891011121314 For example, in 1 142 599 male adolescents (age 16-19 years) followed up over 24 years, low muscle strength was associated with higher all cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease but not from cancer.8 Recent data from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study (n=139 691 adults aged 35-70 years followed up for four years) showed that grip strength was inversely associated with all cause mortality and with non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular mortality, but no significant association was found with respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.7 Moreover, lower grip strength was found to be positively associated with incident cancer in high income countries but not in middle or lower income countries. The authors of this study concluded that, although some data support an association between grip strength and mortality, further research is needed to confirm this association with other health outcomes.7""",Yes,"""A meta-analysis (53 476 participants) published in 2010 showed that grip strength was associated with lower all cause mortality; the association seemed to be weaker in studies in which participants had an average age of 60 years or less, relative to those with a higher average age at baseline.6 The relatively small sample size in this analysis limited the ability to fully explore how associations vary with age. The Tromso study (6850 participants, age 50-80 years) found associations between low grip strength and mortality,5 but no interaction with age was observed; again, power was limited by low participant numbers in this study.

Suggested mechanisms explaining these associations include changes in bioavailable estrogen (increase in 16α-hydroxyestrone, 16-epiestriol, and 2-catechols and decrease in total and free estradiol levels and parent estrogens to metabolites ratio), antioxidative properties of coffee constituents (polyphenol antioxidants), and changes in DNA methylation and cellular differentiation [5,6,7,8,9,10]. Coffee is also the main source of dietary caffeine which has demonstrated conflicting findings with respect to breast cancer risk in previous studies [11]. A recent meta-analysis suggested a weak association of coffee and caffeine intake with breast cancer risk for postmenopausal women [12]. Enzymes involved in metabolism of caffeine are involved in estrogen metabolism and circulating estrogens are known to increase the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer [13,14,15,16]. A previous report found that higher consumption of caffeine was associated with higher urinary concentrations of 16α-hydroxyestrone and 16-epiestriol and a decreased ratio of parent estrogens to metabolites in premenopausal women [5]. In this study, coffee consumption was positively associated with 2-hydroxyestradiol and 2-hydroxyestrone, but there were no associations observed with decaffeinated coffee [5]. Another study found a positive association of coffee and caffeine intake with sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in postmenopausal women, suggesting another potential mechanism by which coffee may reduce the levels of circulating estrogens and subsequently the risk of malignancies [6]. In addition, previous studies suggested that activity of several enzymes, including those involved in estrogen and xenobiotic metabolism, could be altered by coffee consumption [8].""",Yes,"""Postmenopausal hormones have been consistently shown to increase breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women [17].

A notable finding was that participants diagnosed with pathologically diverse inflammatory disorders were at greater risk of both multiple and cumulative cardiometabolic events compared with their counterparts without inflammatory disorders. The large effect size observed for PAD outcome (specifically within the SLE disorder) relative to other outcome measures (ie, CHD, stroke) indicates a possible strong association, however, the wide confidence intervals questions the precision of the estimates. This association would benefit, thus, from confirmation with larger prospective studies.""",Yes,"""Strengths and limitations The present study has several strengths including large sample size with detailed information on socioeconomic factors, objectively assessed mortality data, type of chronic inflammatory disorders and cardiometabolic diseases. The study population is representative of the UK population, supporting the generalisability of the findings. As with most observational studies there are several limitations that need discussing. Our analysis for cardiometabolic risk was rather cross-sectional limiting any robust inferences about the temporal association between inflammatory disorders and cardiometabolic risk. However, the direction of the association and effect sizes were similar to previous prospective studies.1 Cardiometabolic and inflammatory disorders events were identified via self-reports of a clinician diagnosis, increasing the risk of ascertainment bias but unlikely to introduce a systematic error.28 Possible decreased specificity of self-reported diagnoses may have led to overestimation of the reported rates of CVD events, especially among patients with chronic inflammatory disorders. This is particularly true for immune mediated inflammatory disorders (eg, SLE and RA) where common conditions such as pericarditis, myocarditis and pleuritis can mimic CHD; cerebritis can mimic stroke; and peripheral neuropathy may mimic peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Recent evidence29 documented, however, high validity and agreement rates between self-reported cardiometabolic events with medical records among patients diagnosed with RA. The prevalence rates of inflammatory disorders in this study are also in line with evidence from clinical settings.21 27 Also, the study findings are consistent with earlier results based on a large prospective study1 with primary care patients using physicians recorded diagnoses. Future plans to link the UK Biobank data with participants’ medical care records will provide the opportunity to validate the reliability of clinical diagnoses recording in the UK Biobank data. The study population was mainly white European with other ethnic groups being under-represented, questioning the generalisability of the study findings to non-white European populations. The number of outcome events across the different combinations of inflammation disorders was relatively low, which may account for the apparent lack of statistical significance in some conditions (eg, Crohn’s disease). Finally, despite the large sample size available for analysis, the smaller number of cardiometabolic events (eg, PAD) may have inflated the magnitude of the observed association within some inflammatory disorders (eg, SLE), although unlikely to alter the direction of association or statistical significance. The prospective nature of the UK Biobank study will ensure increased incidence of cardiometabolic events providing for more precise estimates in future studies.""",Yes,,Yes,"""Conclusion Compared with the general population, adults diagnosed with clinically diverse inflammatory disorders present heightened rates of multiple cardiometabolic diseases. This risk varied with anti-inflammatory therapy and time of duration of the disorder. For some inflammatory disorders, the increased risk was detectable early in the course of disorder, supporting the public health value of early screening and effective intervention strategy. Recent evidence from primary care data30 suggests that we are falling short of this suggestion. The findings of increased cardiometabolic risks associated with NSAIDs and/or corticosteroids drugs reinforce the need for a more cautionary approach to the prescription of these drugs. The magnitude of the association for SLE supports the development of clinical recommendations for early screening and regular monitoring of cardiometabolic risk in these patients, similar to RA and psoriasis subgroups. Also, the evidence that cardiometabolic risk varied with anti-inflammatory therapy, endorses future evaluations into the potential role of specific DMARDs (alone or in combination with vascular risk therapies (ie, statins)) into the onset and prognosis of cardiometabolic events within specific inflammatory disorder. The UK Biobank follow-up is currently being conducted via linkage with electronic medical records that will, in due course, allow more robust evaluations of the history and treatment of specific inflammatory disorders, and how these factors influence the development and progression of specific and multiple cardiometabolic diseases. In addition, the availability of genotype and imaging data will provide improved opportunities for risk stratification and predictive biomarkers for early cardiometabolic risk identification.""",Yes,"""The study population is representative of the UK population, supporting the generalisability of the findings.""",Yes,"""Funding AD, PC and MM are supported by the National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Center at Guy’s and St Thomas’ National Health Service Foundation Trust and King’s College London.""",No,,No,,No,,,Yes,subheaders in methods,Yes,subheaders in methods,,,,,,,

UK Biobank recruited adults across England, Scotland and Wales, between March 2006 and July 2010: 54,019 participants (women 52%) with complete data were included in the analysis. Those who died in the first year of follow-up (n = 58) were excluded. Fluid intelligence was measured as the number of correct answers during a two minute logic/reasoning-test, reaction time was measured as average time taken to respond to matching symbols on a computer screen and cardiorespiratory fitness was measured through a sub-maximal exercise test. Associations with mortality were assessed by Cox-proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, social deprivation, cancer and non-cancer illnesses, medications, employment, education, smoking, BMI, diet, sleep, and physical activity""",Yes,"""Over 5.8 years of follow-up, there were 779 deaths. Higher intelligence (hazard ratio [HR] per SD = 0.91; 95% CI 0.84, 0.99), faster reaction time (HR per SD = 0.92; 0.85, 0.98) and higher fitness (HR per SD = 0.85; 0.78, 0.93) were associated with a lower risk of mortality after adjustment for each other and other covariates. No interaction was observed between fluid intelligence and reaction time (p = 0.147) or between fluid intelligence and cardiorespiratory fitness (p = 0.238).""",Yes,"""Higher levels of intelligence have consistently been associated with a lower risk of mortality across different populations and age groups (Batterham, Christensen, & Mackinnon, 2009; Calvin et al., 2010; Christensen, Mortensen, Christensen, & Osler, 2016; Iveson, Čukić, Der, Batty, & Deary, 2017). However, mechanisms supporting these associations have not been well elucidated and confounding or reverse causality remains a possibility. One suggested hypothesis is that higher intelligence might reflect greater ‘system integrity’ resulting in an organism that can respond more robustly to environmental stressors (Deary, 2008). This hypothesis has been explored in several small studies through the use of reaction time, which is as a measure of the brain's information processing efficiency whilst also acting as a wider marker of cognitive function and whole body systems integrity (Batterham, Bunce, Mackinnon, & Christensen, 2014; Deary, 2012; Deary & Der, 2005; Hagger-Johnson, Deary, Davies, Weiss, & Batty, 2014; Nissan, Liewald, & Deary, 2013; Roberts, Der, Deary, & Batty, 2009; Shipley, Der, Taylor, & Deary, 2006). For example, a small epidemiological study (n = 898) found that the association between intelligence and mortality was attenuated after adjusting for reaction time, whilst another investigation found that the association between brain white matter integrity and general intelligence was mediated through measures of reaction time (Deary & Der, 2005; Penke et al., 2012). Taken together, these studies suggest whole body system integrity may support higher order manifestations of cognitive function such as general intelligence whilst acting as the fundamental determinant of health status.""",Yes,"""Cardiorespiratory fitness has been associated with brain function and structure whilst exercise training interventions have been shown to reduce reaction time, increase brain volume and improve cognitive functioning (Barnes et al., 2003; Colcombe et al., 2004; Colcombe et al., 2006; Erickson et al., 2011; Freudenberger et al., 2016; Ponce-Bravo, Ponce, Feriche, & Padial, 2015; Predovan, Fraser, Renaud, & Bherer, 2012; Rooks, Kiel, Parsons, & Hayes, 1997). Thus, it is possible that the association between intelligence and mortality are confounded by cardiorespiratory fitness or vice-versa. Alternatively, cardiorespiratory fitness and intelligence may be correlated through sharing some environmental (i.e. exercise) or genetic determinants but reflect largely different systems of overall health and therefore act as independent predictors of mortality.""",Yes,"""The aim of this paper is to investigate whether intelligence, reaction time and cardiorespiratory fitness are independently associated with all-cause mortality within the general population.""",No,,Partially,"""UK Biobank recruited 502,639 individuals living within 25 miles of the 22 study assessment centres located throughout England, Scotland and Wales between March 2006 and July 2010; the aims, methods and assessed outcomes have been reported previously""",Yes,"""UK Biobank recruited 502,639 individuals living within 25 miles of the 22 study assessment centres located throughout England, Scotland and Wales between March 2006 and July 2010; the aims, methods and assessed outcomes have been reported previously""",Partially,"""UK Biobank recruited 502,639 individuals living within 25 miles of the 22 study assessment centres located throughout England, Scotland and Wales between March 2006 and July 2010; the aims, methods and assessed outcomes have been reported previously""",Partially,"""UK Biobank recruited 502,639 individuals living within 25 miles of the 22 study assessment centres located throughout England, Scotland and Wales between March 2006 and July 2010; the aims, methods and assessed outcomes have been reported previously""",Yes,""" Linkage captured all deaths occurring until 31st January 2016 for England and 30th November 2015 for Scotland""",Partially,"""UK Biobank recruited 502,639 individuals living within 25 miles of the 22 study assessment centres located throughout England, Scotland and Wales between March 2006 and July 2010; the aims, methods and assessed outcomes have been reported previously""",Yes,"""This study only includes those that were assigned to and completed at least one stage of the exercise test (n = 59,068).

Cardiorespiratory fitness UK Biobank introduced an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitored submaximal exercise test into their suite of physical assessments in each assessment centre towards the end of recruitment. Those with high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 bpm or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 bpm), chest pain, or pregnant women were excluded from the test. The test was terminated if 75% of age-predicted maximum heart rate was reached. The test involved 2 min at a constant workload followed by 4 min of a linearly increasing workload. The start and end workload of the graded exercise test were standardised according to age, height, weight, resting heart rate and sex to ensure a similar relative intensity across the population. Heart rate was monitored before, during, and after the exercise test via a 4-lead ECG. Maximal cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated using previous published criteria (Celis-Morales et al., 2017), involving: 1) Fitting a linear regression line between heart rate and power output between the preexercise (rest) and final stage; 2) Extrapolating the regression line to the age-predicted maximal heart rate with the formula: 208–0.7 × age; 3) Using the regression equation for the relationship between work rate (power) and oxygen uptake (oxygen uptake [ml kg−1 min−1 ] = 7 + (10.8 × work rate [Watts])/body mass [kg]) to estimate maximal oxygen uptake. Metabolic equivalents (METs) were calculated through dividing maximal oxygen update by 3.5. 2.3. Fluid intelligence Fluid intelligence was assessed through 13 questions using verbal and numeric reasoning/logic delivered over a two minute period. Each question had five possible responses in addition to “do not know” and “prefer not to answer”; participants were asked to select the correct response via a touch screen computer. Participants were instructed as follows: “In this next test you will have a maximum of two minutes to answer as many questions as possible. Don't spend too long on any one question and you can skip any question if you wish”. Each question used in the test is available through the UK Biobank website (UK Biobank, 2017). The number of correct responses was used as the outcome measure. This measure of fluid intelligence employed in UK Biobank has been shown to have good reliability when repeated after a mean of 4 years (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient = 0.65; p < 0.001) (Lyall et al., 2016). 2.4. Reaction time Simple reaction time was assessed with a timed test of symbol matching conducted on a touch screen computer, similar to the card game snap. Two card shapes with symbols were displayed on a computer screen with participants asked to press a red button with their dominant hand if the two cards had matching symbols. Participants undertook the test seated with the red button placed on a desk in front of them. Ten symbols with simple non-complex shapes were used (equals sign, fir tree, hollow circle, hollow square, H, smiley face, solid circle, solid square, triangle, cross). Participants completed 12 rounds, of which the first 5 were considered training rounds and removed from the analysis. Of the remaining rounds, matched cards were shown in rounds 6, 8, 11 and 12. Reaction time was calculated as the average time taken to correctly identify a match. Times under 50 ms were considered to be due to anticipation rather than reaction and removed from the analysis.

Of various genetic, biological, behavioural and environmental factors influencing PA, adiposity was found to be inversely associated with PA in previous cross-sectional studies.5, 6, 7, 8 Some longitudinal studies reported that higher adiposity levels at baseline were associated with lower PA levels at follow-up.9, 10, 11, 12  In addition to adiposity, grip strength (GS), as a proxy measure for overall muscle strength,13 has been known to be a correlate of PA.8, 14, 15 The longer-term relationship between GS and self-report PA has been examined in one previous longitudinal study.16 In fact, all but one10 prior longitudinal studies9, 11, 12, 16 in this area of research employed self-report methods to quantify PA, which are more susceptible to measurement errors compared with the objective measures of PA, such as accelerometers. Accelerometers provide more accurate estimates of PA,17, 18 thereby making it easier to disentangle the true associations between PA, adiposity and GS. Moreover, there has been no longitudinal investigation to examine the interplay of adiposity and GS relative to objectively assessed PA.

This study aimed to determine longitudinal associations of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and grip strength (GS) with objectively measured PA.  Subjects/Methods: Data are from the UK Biobank study. At baseline (2006–2010), BMI, WC and GS were objectively measured. At follow-up (2013–2015), a sub-sample of 93 015 participants (52 161 women) wore a tri-axial accelerometer on the dominant wrist for 7 days. Linear regression was performed to investigate longitudinal associations of standardised BMI, WC and GS at baseline with moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and acceleration after a median 5.7-years follow-up (interquartile range: 4.9–6.5 years).  Results: Linear regression revealed strong inverse associations for BMI and WC, and positive associations for GS with follow-up PA; in women, MVPA ranges from lowest to highest quintiles of GS were 42–48 min day−1 in severely obese (BMI⩾35 kg m−2), 52–57 min day−1 in obese (30⩽BMI<35 kg m−2), 61–65 min day−1 in overweight (25⩽BMI<30 kg m−2) and 69–75 min day−1 in normal weight (18.5⩽BMI<25 kg m−2). Follow-up MVPA was also lower in the lowest GS quintile (42–69 min day−1) compared with the highest GS quintile (48–75 min day−1) across BMI categories in women. The pattern of these associations was generally consistent for men, and in analyses using WC and mean acceleration as exposure and outcome, respectively.  Conclusions: More pronounced obesity and poor strength at baseline independently predict lower activity levels at follow-up. Interventions and policies should aim to improve body composition and muscle strength to promote active living.  Download PDF Introduction Increasing physical activity (PA) levels is an important public health priority as physical inactivity is associated with increased risks of mortality as well as cardiovascular events.1 Studies2, 3, 4 have been performed to examine correlates and determinants of PA in order to inform interventions and policies aimed at increasing PA levels. Of various genetic, biological, behavioural and environmental factors influencing PA, adiposity was found to be inversely associated with PA in previous cross-sectional studies.5, 6, 7, 8 Some longitudinal studies reported that higher adiposity levels at baseline were associated with lower PA levels at follow-up.9, 10, 11, 12  In addition to adiposity, grip strength (GS), as a proxy measure for overall muscle strength,13 has been known to be a correlate of PA.8, 14, 15 The longer-term relationship between GS and self-report PA has been examined in one previous longitudinal study.16 In fact, all but one10 prior longitudinal studies9, 11, 12, 16 in this area of research employed self-report methods to quantify PA, which are more susceptible to measurement errors compared with the objective measures of PA, such as accelerometers. Accelerometers provide more accurate estimates of PA,17, 18 thereby making it easier to disentangle the true associations between PA, adiposity and GS. Moreover, there has been no longitudinal investigation to examine the interplay of adiposity and GS relative to objectively assessed PA. Future PA may be more dependent upon baseline adiposity than strength or vice versa. Hence, it is critical from both epidemiological and public health perspectives to understand the relative contribution of adiposity and GS to PA, in order to promote physically active lifestyles. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the independent and joint longitudinal associations of adiposity and GS with objectively measured PA in middle-aged and older adults participating in a large-scale prospective cohort.  Methods Study design and participants This study uses data collected from the UK Biobank study, which is an ongoing national cohort study of >500 000 UK adults aged 40–69 years at recruitment. The inclusion criteria included living <25 miles away from one of 22 assessment centres across the UK and being registered with the National Health Service. Each participant underwent baseline measurements between 2006 and 2010 collecting a comprehensive series of genetic, behavioural and biological variables, including measurements of body composition and GS. Several years later (2013–2015), 103 720 of the cohort participated in a sub-study in which their PA was objectively measured by wrist accelerometry.19 More detailed descriptions about the rationales and methodology of the UK Biobank project are provided elsewhere.20 Each participant signed informed consent before participation. The UK Biobank protocol was approved by the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee.  Exposures Grip strength (GS) GS was assessed once in each hand using a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Jamar J00105, Lafayette, IN, USA), which can measure isometric grip force up to 90 kilograms. The device has good reliability and reproducibility.21 Staff calibrated the device at the start of each measurement day. Each participant was asked to sit upright on a chair with their forearm on the armrest, and then grasp the handle of the device in their right hand. They were required to maintain a 90° angle of their elbow adjacent to their side so that their thumb would face upwards, while squeezing the handle as strongly as possible for ~3 s. The same protocol was performed with the left hand. For the current analysis, we used average values of the two hands; unless the value from only one hand was available (n=233). Sex- and age-specific quintiles of GS were generated for analyses (Supplementary Table 1).  Adiposity measures Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing measured weight (kg) by measured height squared (m2). Waist circumference (WC) was measured by a tape measure at the level of the umbilicus. For the present analyses, BMI (kg m−2) was categorised as normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9), obesity class I (30.0–34.9) and obesity class II (⩾35.0). A total of 62 men and 373 women who were underweight (BMI<18.5 kg m−2) were excluded from the analyses because of small sample size. Three categories of WC were generated according to the following sex-specific cut points: ⩽79.9 cm, 80.0–87.9 cm and ⩾88.0 cm for women, and ⩽93.9 cm, 94.0–101.9 cm and ⩾102.0 cm for men.22  Physical activity outcomes Accelerometer data collection An invitation to participate in the PA sub-study was emailed between February 2013 and December 2015 to 236 519 participants who had given a valid email address upon recruitment.

The device has good reliability and reproducibility.21 Staff calibrated the device at the start of each measurement day. Each participant was asked to sit upright on a chair with their forearm on the armrest, and then grasp the handle of the device in their right hand. They were required to maintain a 90° angle of their elbow adjacent to their side so that their thumb would face upwards, while squeezing the handle as strongly as possible for ~3 s.

Sex- and age-specific quintiles of GS were generated for analyses (Supplementary Table 1).  Adiposity measures Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing measured weight (kg) by measured height squared (m2). Waist circumference (WC) was measured by a tape measure at the level of the umbilicus. For the present analyses, BMI (kg m−2) was categorised as normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9), obesity class I (30.0–34.9) and obesity class II (⩾35.0).

Participants in the North West region who had been involved in other sub-studies were not invited for accelerometer measurement due to the potential participant burden. Enclosed in an envelope, a tri-axial accelerometer (Axivity AX3, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK23) configured to capture three-dimensional acceleration at 100 Hz with a dynamic range of ±8 g was mailed, along with instructions on proper use of the device, to consenting participants, who were asked to start wearing the monitor on the dominant wrist (defined as the hand that participants typically use to write) upon receipt and for the next 7 days. Devices were programmed to start and finish recording at pre-specified times. Participants were requested to send the monitor back to the co-ordinating centre in a provided pre-paid envelope at the end of the 7-day monitoring period.  Accelerometer data processing Raw accelerometry data were calibrated to local gravity (1 g) with temperature compensation17 and filtered to dampen machine noise using a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20 Hz. Euclidean Norm Minus One was calculated as the Euclidean Norm (vector magnitude) of the acceleration in three axes minus one gravitational unit (1 g), with any negative values truncated to zero. Non-wear was identified as time periods of ⩾60 min where standard deviations of all three axes were <13.0 milli-g (1 milli-g=0.001 g). Overall PA volume (average Euclidean Norm Minus One) and intensity distribution (5-sec resolution) were summarised for each individual activity record, while minimising diurnal bias caused by non-wear.24 Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was defined as Euclidean Norm Minus One values greater than 125 milli-g, and expressed in min day−1.

Conclusion A simple self-reported measure of slow walking pace could aid risk stratification for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality within the general population.""",Yes,"""Introduction Physical fitness, composed of cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength, is an important predictor of mortality and an established target for cardiovascular disease prevention.1–3 Cardiorespiratory fitness, in particular, has shown a strong graded association with the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and is advocated as a clinical vital sign with importance for risk classification.1,4 Therefore, pragmatic methods of harnessing cardiorespiratory fitness for risk stratification are warranted. Studies have found an association between objectively assessed walking pace and mortality, mostly in older adult,5–7 with other studies suggesting self-reported walking pace may act as an important marker of cardiovascular health.8,9 Thus, self-reported walking pace could function as a pragmatic measure of physical fitness and a simple index of mortality risk. However, in order to have clinical and public health relevance, research is needed to examine the extent to which pragmatic self-reported measures of walking pace are associated with cardiorespiratory fitness and whether the associations with all-cause and cause-specific mortality are maintained after adjustment for potential confounding variables or vary across potential effect modifiers such as age, smoking status, or body mass index (BMI).  Muscle strength is also an important and reproducible measure of physical fitness and has been associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.2 Handgrip strength is correlated with overall muscle strength and is associated with functional and health outcomes including frailty, falls, nutritional status and mortality.10–15 Investigating whether associations persist after adjustment for other pragmatic measures of physical fitness, such as walking pace, and maintained across potential effect modifiers will further help elucidate the potential clinical importance of handgrip strength within the general population.""",Yes,"""Investigating whether associations persist after adjustment for other pragmatic measures of physical fitness, such as walking pace, and maintained across potential effect modifiers will further help elucidate the potential clinical importance of handgrip strength within the general population.""",Yes,"""The aim of this analysis was to quantify the associations of self-reported walking pace and handgrip strength with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in men and women from UK Biobank and to investigate whether associations are maintained across categories of age, BMI, and smoking status.""",Yes,Methods start on page 2,Yes,"""UK Biobank This analysis used data from 502 639 participants within UK Biobank, the methods and aim of which have been reported elsewhere.16 In brief, UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort of middle-aged adults designed to support biomedical analysis focused on improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic disease.

Methods UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort comprising 502,637 men and women aged 40–69 years, with detailed baseline assessment. History of fracture was self-reported, and details of hospital admissions for ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (ICD-10:I20-I25) were obtained through linkage to UK Hospital Episode Statistics. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the prospective relationships between prior fracture and hospital admission for men and women, controlling for age, BMI, smoking, alcohol, educational level, physical activity, systolic blood pressure, calcium and vitamin D use, ankle spacing-width, heel BUA and HRT use (women).""",Yes,"""Results Amongst men, a fragility fracture (hip, spine, wrist or arm fracture resulting from a simple fall) within the previous 5 years was associated with a 35% increased risk of IHD admission (fully adjusted HR 1.35; 95%CI 1.00, 1.82; p = 0.047), with the relationship predominantly driven by wrist fractures. Associations with hospitalisation for angina in men were similar in age-adjusted models [HR1.54; 95%CI: 1.03, 2.30), p = 0.037], but did not remain statistical significant after full adjustment [HR 1.64; 95%CI: 0.88, 3.07); p = 0.121]. HRs for admission with angina were lower in women, and neither age- nor fully adjusted relationships attained statistical significance.  Conclusions Prior fragility fracture is an independent risk factor for incident ischaemic cardiovascular events in men. Further work may clarify whether this association is causal or represents shared risk factors, but these findings are likely to be of value in risk assessment of both osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.""",Yes,"""Cardiovascular disease (CVD), together with cancer, is the leading cause of death in the developed world, and as with osteoporosis, it becomes more common with increasing age [1, 2]. Studies have suggested links between osteoporosis and CVD, and low bone mineral density has been associated with increased aortic calcification [3,4,5], risk of cardiovascular events and premature death [3]. Several studies have shown that CVD and vascular calcification are associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and greater risk of fractures [6, 7]. Indeed, a diagnosis of CVD, whether ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke or peripheral arterial disease, has been shown to be related to the subsequent risk of osteoporotic fracture (mostly of the hip), although the exact mechanism remains unclear [8,9,10,11]. Several studies have documented associations between chronic inflammation, osteoporosis [12, 13] and cardiovascular disease [14], together with other conditions such as sarcopenia [15], diabetes/obesity [16] and dementia [17], suggesting one possible common mechanism. However, there is also evidence that risk factors for fracture and ischaemic heart disease overlap considerably [18, 19]. Here, we investigated the relationship between prior fracture and risk of incident cardiovascular events in both men and women, hypothesising that participants with prior fragility fracture would have a higher risk of incident cardiovascular events than those without.""",Yes,"""Indeed, a diagnosis of CVD, whether ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke or peripheral arterial disease, has been shown to be related to the subsequent risk of osteoporotic fracture (mostly of the hip), although the exact mechanism remains unclear [8,9,10,11].

Recent studies investigated the link between AS and oral diseases, particularly periodontitis. Others suggested that periodontitis may have a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between AS and oral conditions. Material and Methods: This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource under Application Number 26307. The UK Biobank recruited around 500000 participants throughout Great Britain. Clinical records were available for 2734 participants. Two case-control studies were conducted based on whether AS was self-reported or clinically diagnosed. Oral conditions were identified using self-reported reports of oral ulcers, painful gums, bleeding gums, loose teeth, toothache, and dentures. The association between AS and oral conditions was assessed using logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, educational level, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and body mass index.""",Yes,"""Results: A total of 1307 cases and 491503 control participants were eligible for the self-reported AS study. The mean age was 58 years for the cases [7.5 standard deviation (SD)] and 57 years for the control groups (8.1 SD). Also, 37.1% of the cases and 54.2% of the control participants were females. Among the oral conditions, only oral ulcers were strongly associated with AS [1.57 adjusted odds ratio (OR); 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31 to 1.88]. For the study of clinically diagnosed AS, 153 cases and 490351 control participants were identified. The mean age for both cases and control groups was 57 years; 7.6 SD for the cases and 8.1 for the control group. Females corresponded to 26.1% of the cases, and 54.2% of the control participants. Clinically diagnosed AS was associated with self-reported oral ulcers (2.17 adjusted OR; 95% CI 1.33 to 3.53). Conclusion: Self-reported and clinically diagnosed AS populations have increased risk of reporting oral ulcers.

Extra-articular manifestations might be associated as well, such as iritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and genitourinary tract inflammation. 1  Recent studies investigated the link between AS and oral diseases, particularly periodontitis. 2–4 Generally, oral diseases are prevalent chronic diseases worldwide; especially periodontal disease and dental caries. Their impact on general health raises their importance. 5  Periodontal disease is a group of diseases which affect the tissue surrounding the teeth. It might lead to the destruction of the alveolar bone and loss of tooth support. These diseases are characterised by periodontal tissue inflammation, gingival bleeding, pocket formation, and/or tooth mobility. 6 Its prevalence and severity increase with age. 7 Periodontal diseases are initiated by periodontal pathogens. However, host response in conjunction with several risk factors, such as cigarette smoking and emotional stress, play an important role in the initiation and progression of periodontal destruction. 7  There is growing evidence that periodontitis is linked and might initiate other systemic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. 8 Others hypothesised that periodontal pathogens, especially Porphyromonas gingivalis, could be the triggering factor for the autoimmunity against citrullinating proteins in the joints, which might initiate rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 9 Evidence of similarity in the immune-pathologic condition between AS and periodontitis is present. Significant elevations in the levels of interleukin 6 and tumour necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-α) are present in both AS and periodontitis patients. 10,11  Due to the difficulties in conducting population- based studies using clinical diagnosis, self-reported disease is an alternative way of diagnosis. Selfreported AS was shown to be agreeable with the clinical records 12 , whereas self-reported periodontal disease was shown to be agreeable with the clinical diagnosis of periodontitis. 13 It was also shown that the reporting of the number of natural teeth, presence or absence of prosthetic appliance, and root canal filling by the patients was agreeable with the clinical findings for these patients. 14""",No,"No discussion of gaps in the literature ",Yes,"""The aims of this study are:  To report the findings of two case-control studies based on the UK Biobank database;  Identify any associations between AS and oral conditions identified in the database.""",Yes,Methods start on page 2,Partially,"Missing information on eligibility and recruitment methods ""The UK Biobank is a large population-based cohort study with approximately half a million participants recruited from 22 assessment centres throughout Great Britain between 2006 and 2010.

However, HRR at earlier time intervals after cessation has not been well evaluated and might better reflect PNS reactivation. We hypothesize that early HRR indices within the first minute is better associated with all‐cause and coronary artery disease mortality compared with HRR at 1 minute.  Methods and Results The prognostic value of HRR at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 seconds after cessation of exercise was investigated in 40 727 selected UK Biobank participants (mean age 56 years, 45% male) free from cardiovascular disease. """,Partially,"Missing statistical results ""During a median follow‐up period of 6 years, 536 participants died (including 39 of coronary artery disease). In multivariable analyses, including adjustments for aerobic exercise capacity, cardiovascular risk factors, and factors associated with mortality in general, only HRR at 10 seconds remained predictive of both all‐cause and coronary artery disease mortality. Effects of HRR were larger and more significant when measured early after exercise cessation. Moreover, the association of change in heart rate between 10 seconds and 1 minute after exercise cessation with mortality was dependent on HRR at 10 seconds.  Conclusions We provide evidence that decreased HRR at 10 seconds after cessation of exercise is a superior predictor of outcome compared with HRR at later time intervals. This observation might have important implications for the future reporting and interpretation of exercise tests.""",Yes,"""Introduction Heart rate recovery (HRR), the decrease of heart rate following cessation of exercise, has been previously investigated and has been established as a predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD),1, 2 death from CAD,3 and cardiovascular,4 noncardiovascular,5 all‐cause mortality.1, 3, 6, 7 Some of these studies have been conducted in a population without a history of cardiovascular disease1, 3, 5, 6 and others in symptomatic patients who were referred for an exercise test.4, 7  HRR is thought to reflect the balance of reactivation of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), withdrawal of the sympathetic nervous system, and possibly circulating catecholamines. It has long been known that reactivation of the PNS is the main contributor to interindividual HRR differences and that the effect of this reactivation is strongest in the first 30 seconds after termination of exercise.8 Despite this knowledge, HRR is commonly determined at 1 minute after termination of exercise.1, 3, 6 Recently, a study by McCrory et al9 described HRR within a 1‐minute interval after an orthostatic challenge, and found that speed of HRR in the immediate 20 seconds was the strongest predictor of all‐cause mortality. Whether HRR measured early after exercise cessation is also of increased value for prediction models remains to be determined.""",Yes,"""Recently, a study by McCrory et al9 described HRR within a 1‐minute interval after an orthostatic challenge, and found that speed of HRR in the immediate 20 seconds was the strongest predictor of all‐cause mortality.

In women and men, respectively, hazard ratios per 5 kg lower grip strength were higher (all at P<0.05) for all cause mortality (1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.23, and 1.16, 1.15 to 1.17) and cause specific mortality from cardiovascular disease (1.19, 1.13 to 1.25, and 1.22, 1.18 to 1.26), all respiratory disease (1.31, 1.22 to 1.40, and 1.24, 1.20 to 1.28), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.24, 1.05 to 1.47, and 1.19, 1.09 to 1.30), all cancer (1.17, 1.13 to 1.21, 1.10, 1.07 to 1.13), colorectal cancer (1.17, 1.04 to 1.32, and 1.18, 1.09 to 1.27), lung cancer (1.17, 1.07 to 1.27, and 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), and breast cancer (1.24, 1.10 to 1.39) but not prostate cancer (1.05, 0.96 to 1.15). Several of these relations had higher hazard ratios in the younger age group. Muscle weakness (defined as grip strength <26 kg for men and <16 kg for women) was associated with a higher hazard for all health outcomes, except colon cancer in women and prostate cancer and lung cancer in both men and women. The addition of handgrip strength improved the prediction ability, based on C index change, of an office based risk score (age, sex, diabetes diagnosed, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and smoking) for all cause (0.013) and cardiovascular mortality (0.012) and incidence of cardiovascular disease (0.009).  Conclusion Higher grip strength was associated with a range of health outcomes and improved prediction of an office based risk score. Further work on the use of grip strength in risk scores or risk screening is needed to establish its potential clinical utility.""",Yes,""" Introduction The main role of skeletal muscle is to control body movements through the generation of force. Skeletal muscle is also the primary protein store within the body and in chronic conditions, such as cancer, and it can provide gluconeogenic precursors that are crucial for survival as such conditions progress.1 In addition to this, skeletal muscle is the primary outlet for glucose disposal in the body and is therefore important in metabolic conditions such as diabetes.2 Muscle mass is also decreased (cachexia) in many conditions, such as cancer, respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, and chronic infection and sepsis.3 With these broad physiological and functional roles, skeletal muscle has a critical, but often underrated, role in health.4  Many studies have shown that lower muscle function is associated with greater mortality and morbidity.567891011121314 For example, in 1 142 599 male adolescents (age 16-19 years) followed up over 24 years, low muscle strength was associated with higher all cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease but not from cancer.8 Recent data from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study (n=139 691 adults aged 35-70 years followed up for four years) showed that grip strength was inversely associated with all cause mortality and with non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular mortality, but no significant association was found with respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.7 Moreover, lower grip strength was found to be positively associated with incident cancer in high income countries but not in middle or lower income countries. The authors of this study concluded that, although some data support an association between grip strength and mortality, further research is needed to confirm this association with other health outcomes.7  Therefore, clear evidence shows that low grip strength is associated with a range of poorer health outcomes.567891011121314 Furthermore, grip strength enhances prediction of mortality based on age (C index increase from 0.65 for age to 0.69 for age+grip strength) and sex (C index increase from 0.54 for sex to 0.63 for sex+grip).14 However, whether the addition of handgrip strength to a traditional office based risk score (including age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, presence of diabetes, and body mass index15) improves risk prediction is unclear. Such analysis will allow us to determine whether measurement of grip strength has clinical utility for risk prediction in settings where blood based measures are not readily available (for example, community/rural settings or low/middle income countries).  A meta-analysis (53 476 participants) published in 2010 showed that grip strength was associated with lower all cause mortality; the association seemed to be weaker in studies in which participants had an average age of 60 years or less, relative to those with a higher average age at baseline.6 The relatively small sample size in this analysis limited the ability to fully explore how associations vary with age. The Tromso study (6850 participants, age 50-80 years) found associations between low grip strength and mortality,5 but no interaction with age was observed; again, power was limited by low participant numbers in this study""",Yes,"""A meta-analysis (53 476 participants) published in 2010 showed that grip strength was associated with lower all cause mortality; the association seemed to be weaker in studies in which participants had an average age of 60 years or less, relative to those with a higher average age at baseline.6 The relatively small sample size in this analysis limited the ability to fully explore how associations vary with age.

Grip strength was measured as previously described,19 and the mean of the right and left values was expressed in absolute units (kg) for subsequent analysis. Physical activity was based on self report, using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form,20 and total physical activity was calculated as the sum of walking and moderate and vigorous activity, measured as metabolic equivalents (MET-min/week). We derived total time spent in sedentary behaviours from the sum of self reported time spent driving, using a computer, and watching television.  Dietary information was collected via the Oxford WebQ, a web based 24 hour recall questionnaire that was developed specifically for use in large population studies.2122 We derived area based socioeconomic status from the postcode of residence, using the Townsend score.23 We calculated age from dates of birth and baseline assessment. We categorised smoking status into never, former, and current smoking. We collected medical history (physician’s diagnosis of depression, stroke, angina, heart attack, hypertension, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or longstanding illness) from the self completed baseline assessment questionnaire. Trained nurses measured height and body weight during the initial assessment centre visit. We calculated body mass index as weight/height2 and used the World Health Organization’s criteria to classify it into categories of underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5 to <25), overweight (25 to <30), obese (30 to <35), obesity class 2 (35 to <40), and obesity class 3 (≥40). Trained nurses measured body composition (body fat and fat free mass) by using bio-impedance.

Design Prospective population based study.  Setting UK Biobank.  Participants 502 293 participants (54% women) aged 40-69 years.  Main outcome measures All cause mortality as well as incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer (all cancer, colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate).  Results Of the participants included in analyses, 13 322 (2.7%) died over a mean of 7.1 (range 5.3-9.9) years’ follow-up. In women and men, respectively, hazard ratios per 5 kg lower grip strength were higher (all at P<0.05) for all cause mortality (1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.23, and 1.16, 1.15 to 1.17) and cause specific mortality from cardiovascular disease (1.19, 1.13 to 1.25, and 1.22, 1.18 to 1.26), all respiratory disease (1.31, 1.22 to 1.40, and 1.24, 1.20 to 1.28), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.24, 1.05 to 1.47, and 1.19, 1.09 to 1.30), all cancer (1.17, 1.13 to 1.21, 1.10, 1.07 to 1.13), colorectal cancer (1.17, 1.04 to 1.32, and 1.18, 1.09 to 1.27), lung cancer (1.17, 1.07 to 1.27, and 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), and breast cancer (1.24, 1.10 to 1.39) but not prostate cancer (1.05, 0.96 to 1.15). Several of these relations had higher hazard ratios in the younger age group. Muscle weakness (defined as grip strength <26 kg for men and <16 kg for women) was associated with a higher hazard for all health outcomes, except colon cancer in women and prostate cancer and lung cancer in both men and women. The addition of handgrip strength improved the prediction ability, based on C index change, of an office based risk score (age, sex, diabetes diagnosed, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and smoking) for all cause (0.013) and cardiovascular mortality (0.012) and incidence of cardiovascular disease (0.009).  Conclusion Higher grip strength was associated with a range of health outcomes and improved prediction of an office based risk score. Further work on the use of grip strength in risk scores or risk screening is needed to establish its potential clinical utility.  Introduction The main role of skeletal muscle is to control body movements through the generation of force. Skeletal muscle is also the primary protein store within the body and in chronic conditions, such as cancer, and it can provide gluconeogenic precursors that are crucial for survival as such conditions progress.1 In addition to this, skeletal muscle is the primary outlet for glucose disposal in the body and is therefore important in metabolic conditions such as diabetes.2 Muscle mass is also decreased (cachexia) in many conditions, such as cancer, respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, and chronic infection and sepsis.3 With these broad physiological and functional roles, skeletal muscle has a critical, but often underrated, role in health.4  Many studies have shown that lower muscle function is associated with greater mortality and morbidity.567891011121314 For example, in 1 142 599 male adolescents (age 16-19 years) followed up over 24 years, low muscle strength was associated with higher all cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease but not from cancer.8 Recent data from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study (n=139 691 adults aged 35-70 years followed up for four years) showed that grip strength was inversely associated with all cause mortality and with non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular mortality, but no significant association was found with respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.7 Moreover, lower grip strength was found to be positively associated with incident cancer in high income countries but not in middle or lower income countries. The authors of this study concluded that, although some data support an association between grip strength and mortality, further research is needed to confirm this association with other health outcomes.7  Therefore, clear evidence shows that low grip strength is associated with a range of poorer health outcomes.567891011121314 Furthermore, grip strength enhances prediction of mortality based on age (C index increase from 0.65 for age to 0.69 for age+grip strength) and sex (C index increase from 0.54 for sex to 0.63 for sex+grip).14 However, whether the addition of handgrip strength to a traditional office based risk score (including age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, presence of diabetes, and body mass index15) improves risk prediction is unclear. Such analysis will allow us to determine whether measurement of grip strength has clinical utility for risk prediction in settings where blood based measures are not readily available (for example, community/rural settings or low/middle income countries).  A meta-analysis (53 476 participants) published in 2010 showed that grip strength was associated with lower all cause mortality; the association seemed to be weaker in studies in which participants had an average age of 60 years or less, relative to those with a higher average age at baseline.6 The relatively small sample size in this analysis limited the ability to fully explore how associations vary with age. The Tromso study (6850 participants, age 50-80 years) found associations between low grip strength and mortality,5 but no interaction with age was observed; again, power was limited by low participant numbers in this study. The large size of the UK Biobank cohort provides the opportunity to robustly determine whether the association between grip strength and health outcomes differs by age.  The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the associations of grip strength with all cause mortality and disease specific incidence and mortality, how these associations vary with age, and whether the addition of grip strength improves the prediction ability of established office based risk scores, in the UK Biobank, a very large, general population cohort.  Methods Between April 2007 and December 2010, UK Biobank recruited 502 628 participants (5.5% response rate after invitation letters sent to around 9 million people), aged 40-69 years, from the general population.16 Participants attended one of 22 assessment centres across England, Wales, and Scotland,1718 where they completed a touch screen questionnaire, had physical measurements taken, and provided biological samples, as described in detail elsewhere.1718 The outcomes in the study reported here were incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease, all respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, all cancers, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer, as well as all cause mortality, with the exposure variable being grip strength (age and sex specific quarters and 5 kg increase in grip strength). We treated sociodemographic factors (age, sex, ethnicity, and area based socioeconomic status), month of recruitment, smoking status, height, body mass index, and self reported physical activity, sedentary time, and dietary intake as potential confounders, as well as prevalent diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, cancer, and longstanding illness at baseline (where participants with these conditions were not excluded from the analyses).  Procedures Date of death and date and cause of hospital admissions were identified as described previously.19 We defined incident cardiovascular disease as a hospital admission or death with ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes I60, I61, I63, I64, I21, I21.4, and I21.9. We defined respiratory disease as ICD-10 codes J09-J98 and I26-I27 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as ICD-10 code J44. We defined all cause cancer as an ICD-10 code of C0.0-C9.9, D3.7-9, or D4.0-8 recorded on the cancer registry, death certificate, or hospital admission. We defined cause specific cancers by using the following ICD-10 codes recorded on the cancer registry, death certificate, or hospital admission: breast cancer (C50), prostate cancer (C61), lung cancer (C34), and colorectal cancer (C18, C19, and C20).  Grip strength was measured as previously described,19 and the mean of the right and left values was expressed in absolute units (kg) for subsequent analysis. Physical activity was based on self report, using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form,20 and total physical activity was calculated as the sum of walking and moderate and vigorous activity, measured as metabolic equivalents (MET-min/week). We derived total time spent in sedentary behaviours from the sum of self reported time spent driving, using a computer, and watching television.  Dietary information was collected via the Oxford WebQ, a web based 24 hour recall questionnaire that was developed specifically for use in large population studies.2122 We derived area based socioeconomic status from the postcode of residence, using the Townsend score.23 We calculated age from dates of birth and baseline assessment. We categorised smoking status into never, former, and current smoking. We collected medical history (physician’s diagnosis of depression, stroke, angina, heart attack, hypertension, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or longstanding illness) from the self completed baseline assessment questionnaire. Trained nurses measured height and body weight during the initial assessment centre visit. We calculated body mass index as weight/height2 and used the World Health Organization’s criteria to classify it into categories of underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5 to <25), overweight (25 to <30), obese (30 to <35), obesity class 2 (35 to <40), and obesity class 3 (≥40). Trained nurses measured body composition (body fat and fat free mass) by using bio-impedance. Further details of these measurements can be found in the UK Biobank’s online protocol (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk).  Statistical analyses We used multivariable cubic regression splines to visually explore non-linear associations between grip strength and health outcomes. As we found no evidence of deviation from linearity, we investigated the associations of grip strength with cause specific incidence and mortality over follow-up with Cox proportional hazard models. We reported the results as hazard ratios together with 95% confidence intervals. The models for incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer excluded participants with a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, or stroke), respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cancer at baseline, respectively.  Firstly, we treated grip strength as a continuous variable and calculated hazard ratios per 5 kg decrement in grip strength for men and women separately. To enable comparability with other reports in the literature, we also calculated hazard ratios for age and sex specific quarters of grip strength (supplementary table A), with participants in the highest quarter for grip strength used as the reference group. We also did analyses using a sex specific cut-off point for clinically relevant muscle weakness (supplementary table B), as recommended by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Sarcopenia Project.24 We investigated potential sex interactions by fitting a multiplicative interaction term into the models between grip strength (kg) and sex; although we found no significant interactions for the effect of grip strength on health outcomes by sex, we have presented stratified analyses because levels of grip strength differ significantly between woman and men (supplementary table C).  For Cox proportional hazard analyses, we ran four models that included an increasing number of covariates: model 0 (minimally adjusted) included sociodemographic covariates (age, sex, ethnicity, Townsend index, and month of recruitment); model 1 was adjusted as in model 0 but also included height; model 2 was adjusted as in model 1 but also included prevalent morbidity (hypertension, diabetes, depression, and longstanding illness, as well as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer when these were not the outcome); model 3 (fully adjusted) was adjusted as in model 2 but also included lifestyle factors (smoking status, body mass index categories, total physical activity, total sedentary time, and dietary intake of alcohol, fruit and vegetables, oily fish, red meat, and processed meat)....  We then investigated whether these associations differed by age by doing a two way interaction analysis and fitting a handgrip strength*age interaction term to our model. We then repeated our Cox proportional hazard analyses (models 3 and 4) stratified by age categories (≤55, 56-65, and >65 years). ...

This indicates that the addition of the measurement of grip strength may be useful in screening for risk of cardiovascular disease in community/rural settings and in developing countries where access to biochemical measurements (such as total cholesterol) is not possible.

Cancer diagnoses were ascertained through the linkage to the UK National Health Service Central Registers.

We used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate associations between coffee consumption and breast cancer, overall and in stratified analyses by woman’s PMH status (none, past, current).""",Yes,"""Results In the overall analysis, coffee consumption was not associated with breast cancer risk (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.91–1.11 for 2–3 cups/day, and HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87–1.10 for ≥ 4 cups/day, p-trend = 0.69). Women with no PMH history who consumed ≥ 4 cups/day had a 16% reduced risk of breast cancer as compared to women who consumed < 7 cups/week (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71–1.00). Among women with past PMH, those consuming ≥ 4 cups/day had a 22% greater risk of breast cancer than women consuming < 7 cups/week (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01–1.47).

Conclusions Coffee consumption might be associated with increased breast cancer risk in women who used hormones in the past. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and elucidate potential biological mechanisms underlying the observed associations.""",Yes,"""Previous studies suggest that coffee consumption may be associated with reduced breast cancer risk [1,2,3,4]. Suggested mechanisms explaining these associations include changes in bioavailable estrogen (increase in 16α-hydroxyestrone, 16-epiestriol, and 2-catechols and decrease in total and free estradiol levels and parent estrogens to metabolites ratio), antioxidative properties of coffee constituents (polyphenol antioxidants), and changes in DNA methylation and cellular differentiation [5,6,7,8,9,10]. Coffee is also the main source of dietary caffeine which has demonstrated conflicting findings with respect to breast cancer risk in previous studies [11]. A recent meta-analysis suggested a weak association of coffee and caffeine intake with breast cancer risk for postmenopausal women [12]. Enzymes involved in metabolism of caffeine are involved in estrogen metabolism and circulating estrogens are known to increase the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer [13,14,15,16]. A previous report found that higher consumption of caffeine was associated with higher urinary concentrations of 16α-hydroxyestrone and 16-epiestriol and a decreased ratio of parent estrogens to metabolites in premenopausal women [5]. In this study, coffee consumption was positively associated with 2-hydroxyestradiol and 2-hydroxyestrone, but there were no associations observed with decaffeinated coffee [5]. Another study found a positive association of coffee and caffeine intake with sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in postmenopausal women, suggesting another potential mechanism by which coffee may reduce the levels of circulating estrogens and subsequently the risk of malignancies [6]. In addition, previous studies suggested that activity of several enzymes, including those involved in estrogen and xenobiotic metabolism, could be altered by coffee consumption [8].""",Yes,"""Postmenopausal hormones have been consistently shown to increase breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women [17].

For women, abdominal adiposity, rather than overall body size, was associated with a greater colorectal cancer risk.""",Yes,"""A substantial body of evidence has shown that excess adiposity is associated with a greater risk of developing colorectal cancer. A meta-analysis of 30 cohort studies reported that a 5 kg/m2 increment in body mass index (BMI) was associated with greater risk of developing colon cancer in both sexes, but that this relationship was weaker among women (relative risk [RR] = 1.12, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.07–1.18) compared to men (RR = 1.30, 95%CI: 1.25–1.35)1.

Potential reasons for a weaker relationship between adiposity and colorectal cancer among women compared to men are not clear. It has been suggested that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use, which has been consistently associated with lower risk of developing colorectal cancer2, may counteract the detrimental effects of excess adiposity on colorectal tumorigenesis3. Support for this hypothesis was provided by the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study which found that larger waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio were associated with a greater risk of developing colon cancer among non-HRT users only, with no relationship observed for HRT users4. However, inconsistent findings have been reported in other studies which have investigated whether HRT use modified the relationship between obesity and colorectal cancer5,6. Additional studies with large numbers of incident cases are required to investigate how adiposity relates to colorectal cancer risk among users and non-users of HRT.  Body fat composition measurements that distinguish between adipose and non-adipose mass can be estimated using bioelectrical impedance.
