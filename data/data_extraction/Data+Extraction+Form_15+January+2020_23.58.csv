We conducted the largest examination of this association to date throughanalysis of the UK Biobank, a large population-based sample of adults aged 40e69 years. We also soughtto determine associations between cognitive performance and self-reported chronotype, sleep medica-tion use and sleep duration.Methods:This cross-sectional, population-based study involved 477,529 participants, comprising 133,314patients with frequent insomnia symptoms (age: 57.4±7.7 years; 62.1% female) and 344,215 controlswithout insomnia symptoms (age: 56.1±8.2 years; 52.0% female).

Adjusted models included relevant demographic, clinical, and sleep variables.""",Partially,"No numerical results ""Results:Frequent insomnia symptoms were associated with cognitive impairment in unadjusted models;however, these effects were reversed after full adjustment, leaving those with frequent insomniasymptoms showing statistically better cognitive performance over those without. Relative to interme-diate chronotype, evening chronotype was associated with superior task performance, while morningchronotype was associated with the poorest performance. Sleep medication use and both long (>9 h) andshort (<7 h) sleep durations were associated with impaired performance.Conclusions:Our results suggest that after adjustment for potential confounding variables, frequentinsomnia symptoms may be associated with a small statistical advantage, which is unlikely to be clin-ically meaningful, on simple neurocognitive tasks. Further work is required to examine the mechanisticunderpinnings of an apparent evening chronotype advantage in cognitive performance and theimpairment associated with morning chronotype, sleep medication use, and sleep duration extremes.""",Yes,"""1. IntroductionInsomnia is defined as persistent difficulties with sleep initi-ation and/or maintenance, resulting in significant impairment todaytime functioning. At the symptom level, insomnia affects up toone-third of the adult population, while persistent insomnia af-fects approximately 10e12% and is associated with increased riskfor cardiovascular disease, depression, and early mortality[1,2].Both daytime functioning and quality of life are known to beseverely affected in those with insomnia and often drive treat-ment seeking[3e5].Morespecifically, previous work shows thatthe most commonly cited areas of daytime dysfunction areproblems with fatigue, work performance, cognitive perfor-mance, and emotion regulation[6]. Insomnia has also beenassociated with a range of serious and non-serious sleep-relatedaccidents[7].While experimental sleep loss engenders reliable cognitiveimpairment, particularly for vigilance, complex attention, andworking memory[8], there has been comparatively little work oninsomnia. In general, thefield has been characterised by mixedfindings, with some studies showing impairment and othersfailing to observe differences from controls[9]. Nevertheless,meta-analytic data suggest thatpatients exhibit reliable im-pairments in tasks probing episodic memory, working memory,and  problem  solving,  with  small-to-medium  effect  sizes[10]. Recent, well-controlled studies have found evidence ofinsomnia-related impairments in switching of attention andworking memory[11], and sustained attention and episodicmemory[12].However,therecontinuestobeconflictingfindingsin the insomnia literature[13e15],andstudiesgenerallyrecruitsmall samples of patients with‘primary insomnia’,whoareotherwise healthy.Larger epidemiology-based studies of insomnia symptoms andcognitive performance similarly display mixed results: showingevidence of impairment[16], no evidence of impairment[17]orimpairment only for specific insomnia sub-groups[15,18].""",Yes,"""To ourknowledge, no study has investigated insomnia symptoms andcognitive performance in a large population-based sample ofmiddle-aged adults, with a standardised test battery, while simul-taneously appraising the effects of other important sleep variables,including chronotype, sleep duration, and sleep medication.The present study aimed to conduct the largest investigation ofinsomnia symptoms and cognitive performance to date throughanalysis of UK Biobank data.

Sleep-related variablesand cognitive performance were assessed in a single visit thatlasted approximately 90 min.2.3. Sleep-related variablesTo assess insomnia symptoms, participants were asked‘Do youhave trouble falling asleep at night or do you wake up in themiddle of the night?’with responses‘never/rarely’,‘sometimes’and‘usually’. Participants were categorised as having frequentinsomnia symptoms if they answered‘usually’to this question,while the remaining participants made up the control groupwithout frequent insomnia symptoms. Chronotype was assessedusing the following question:‘Do you consider yourself to be’...:‘definitely a“morning”person’,‘more a“morning”than“evening”person’,‘more an“evening”than“morning”person’,‘definitely an“evening”person’. For the purposes of the present study, wecollapsed the two middle responses into an‘intermediate’chro-notype category, permitting comparisons with the‘definitelymorning’and‘definitely evening’groups. Sleep duration wasrecorded as the number of reported hours to the following ques-tion:‘About how many hours sleep do you get in every 24 h? (include naps)’. Given previously established U-shape relationshipswith health and cognition[20], we categorised sleep duration intoshort (<7 h), normal (7e9h)andlong(>9 h) based on recentguidelines[21].2.4. Cognitive performanceFive cognitive measures were administered through a compu-terised touchscreen interface[22]. Time to complete allfivecognitive tests was approximately 15 min. The tests were designedspecifically for the UK Biobank to allow administration at scalewithout examiner supervision. The tasks show evidence of an un-derlying performance factor and good stability over time, with theexception of visual memory performance, which has a compara-tively lower intraclass correlation coefficient[22]. Thefive tasks involved the following instructions:Reasoning: This task assessed the ability to solve 13 verbal andnumeric reasoning problems. Each problem hadfive possibleresponse options. The dependent variable was the total numberof correct answers given (range 0e13) within a 2-min period,with higher scores indicating better performance.Basic reaction time: This task was delivered in the style of thecard game,‘snap’, and requested participants to respond with abutton press when they detected the appearance of a matchingpair of symbols. The dependent variable was the mean responsetime in milliseconds across 12 matching-pair trials. RT valueswere log-transformed because of skewed distribution (ln x).Numeric short-term memory: In this task, a string of numberswas presented on the screen, which subsequently disappeared.Participants were then asked to enter the number string frommemory, in the reverse order, through a keypad. The dependentvariable was the maximum string length recalled correctly(range: 0e12), with higher scores indicating better perfor-mance. The test was discontinued afterfive successive incorrectresponses at string length¼2.Visual memory: In this task, six card pairs of symbols were pre-sented on-screen in a random pattern. Cards were then turnedface down on the screen, and participants were asked to locate asmany symbol pairs as possible in as few attempts as possible. Thedependent variable was the number of errors made during pairsmatching (range 0e146), which was log-transformed because ofskewed distribution and zero inflation (ln (xþ1)).Prospective memory: In this task, participants were asked toremember to perform a pre-planned instruction. Specifically, atthe beginning of the test battery, they were presented with thefollowing instruction:‘At the end of the games we will show youfour coloured symbols and ask you to touch the blue square.However, to test your memory, we want you to actually touch theorange circle instead’. If participants remembered to touch theorange circle onfirst attempt, they were coded as‘correct’(1),while those failing to do so were set to 0.2.5. Demographic dataDemographic data included age, sex, and neighbourhood-levelsocioeconomic status as measured by the Townsend index of ma-terial deprivation. For statistical analyses, socioeconomic status waslog-transformed because of skewed distribution by using an‘ln(xþ7)’equation (minimum of non-transformed index:6.26).Educational qualifications were recorded and were dichotomisedaccording to whether participants held a college/university degree.We also included body mass index (BMI) as a covariate in adjustedanalyses.2.6. Medication and clinical dataCurrent medications were self-reported to the research nurse,and the participants were dichotomised according to whether theywere taking sleep medication (sedatives and hypnotics), any otherpsychotropic medication (mood stabilisers, antidepressants, andantipsychotics) or antihypertensive medication (ACE inhibitors,angiotensin II antagonists, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers,and diuretics). Current depressive symptoms were assessed usingthe following question:‘Over the past two weeks, how often haveyou felt down, depressed or hopeless?’, with the followingresponse options:‘not at all’,‘several days’,‘more than half thedays’or‘nearly every day’. For the purpose of the present analyses,those scoring‘several days’,‘more than half the days’or‘nearlyevery day’were coded in the‘depressive symptoms’category, whilethose scoring‘not at all’were considered in the‘no depressivesymptoms’category. In addition, participants were dichotomisedaccording to whether they reported hypertension or any cardio-vascular disease.2.7. AnalysesDescriptive data presentation included mean values and stan-dard deviations and the proportion of the sample reporting specificquestionnaire response options. Questionnaire response options,‘do not know’or‘prefer not to answer’, were handled as missingvalues. For cognitive dependent variables, the sample size variedacross tests because the reasoning and prospective memory testswere added after the commencement of data collection, while thenumeric memory task was included from the outset but subse-quently removed because of time constraints.In afirst step (unadjusted analyses, model 1), the associationbetween insomnia status (those with frequent insomnia symptomsvs. those without frequent insomnia symptoms) and cognitiveperformance was analysed using four linear models, with insomniastatus as the single predictor variable and reasoning, basic reactiontime, numeric memory, and visual memory as dependent variables.The association between insomnia status and prospective memoryperformance was investigated using a logistic model. In a secondstep (model 2), age, sex, socioeconomic status, and education wereadded as covariates in the linear and logistic models described inmodel 1. In a third step (model 3), chronotype (with the interme-diate type as the reference category), sleep medication use, BMI as acontinuous variable, hypertension, antihypertensive medication,cardiovascular disease, depressive symptoms, and psychotropicmedication were added as further covariates. In afinal step (model4), sleep duration (with 7e9 h as the reference category) wasinserted as an additional predictor of cognitive performance. Wetherefore report unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted relation-ships between insomnia status and cognitive outcomes. For chro-notype, sleep duration and sleep medication, we report only thefully adjusted relationships (model 4) controlling for all de-mographic, clinical and remaining sleep variables.

First, this was a cross-sectional study and therefore ourfindings cannot elucidate cau-sality. Second, our cognitive dependent variables were created forbrief completion on large numbers of participants and hence havenot undergone formal validation. In partial mitigation, principalcomponent analyses support an expected underlying performance(g) factor across tasks, and test-retest suggests good stability formost task-dependent variables[22]. Moreover, associations withvariables in the expected direction (eg, with age and education),evidence of impairment in those with psychiatric disorder[24]andassociations with several genetic variants[49]provide furthersupport of task validity. However, tasks were brief and did notparametrically manipulate cognitive load, and the battery did notsample additional domains of cognition, potentially contributing tolimited sensitivity for insomnia-related impairment. Third, oursleep trait predictor variables were limited by their low resolution,reflecting just single item self-report questions. For example, oursleep duration estimate included daytime naps and therefore wecould not separate the contribution of night and daytime sleep,which may have affected group categorisation and, by extension,associations with our dependent variables of interest. We could notinvestigate subtypes of insomnia that may have unique relation-ships with cognitive impairment[16]. Specifically, we could notcategorise participants into insomnia disorder because we lackedinformation on chronicity of sleep problems, quantitative criteria(eg, minutes for sleep-onset latency and wake-time during thenight), attribution for daytime cognitive impairment or help-seeking. Greater precision around these factors and objectivesleep data may have identified sub-groups of participants withcognitive impairment[12,15,18,30,50]. Our results therefore canonly speak to frequent insomnia symptoms at the population level.Fourth, our sample age was restricted to those predominantly inthe middle age. It may be that insomnia confers the greatest risk tocognitive impairment in elderly samples[23]. Fifth, while the UKBiobank represents a large and unique resource, the recruitmentmethod and low response rate (5.5%) may have resulted in selectionbiases, potentially limiting generalisability to the broader UK pop-ulation[51].

Design: The study was conducted using the UK Biobank resource, a population-based cohort of 40- to 69-year olds. Self-report data on hearing, tinnitus, sleep difficulties, and demographic variables were collected from cochlear implant users (n = 194) and individuals identified as potential candidates for cochlear implantation (n = 211). These “candidates” were selected based on (i) impaired hearing sensitivity, inferred from self-reported hearing aid use and (ii) impaired hearing function, inferred from an inability to report words accurately at negative signal to noise ratios on an unaided closed-set test of speech perception. Data on tinnitus (presence, persistence, and related distress) and on sleep difficulties were analyzed using logistic regression models controlling for gender, age, deprivation, and neuroticism.""",Yes,"""Results: The prevalence of tinnitus was similar among implant users (50%) and candidates (52%; p = 0.39). However, implant users were less likely to report that their tinnitus was distressing at its worst (41%) compared with candidates (63%; p = 0.02). The logistic regression model suggested that this difference between the two groups could be explained by the fact that tinnitus was less persistent in implant users (46%) compared with candidates (72%; p < 0.001). Self-reported difficulties with sleep were similar among implant users (75%) and candidates (82%; p = 0.28), but participants with tinnitus were more likely to report sleep difficulties than those without (p < 0.001). The prevalence of sleep difficulties was not related to tinnitus persistence (p = 0.28) or the extent to which tinnitus was distressing (p = 0.55). Conclusions: The lack of association between tinnitus persistence and sleep difficulties is compatible with the notion that tinnitus is suppressed in implant users primarily during active electrical stimulation and may return when the implant is switched off at night time. This explanation is supported by the similar prevalence of sleep problems among implant users and potential candidates for cochlear implantation, despite differences between the groups in tinnitus persistence and related emotional distress. Cochlear implantation may therefore not be an appropriate intervention where the primary aim is to alleviate sleep difficulties""",Yes,"""Introduction Tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of an external stimulus, affects about 16% of the adult population (Dawes et al. 2014; McCormack et al. 2014). Hearing loss has been established as a major risk factor for tinnitus (Nondahl et al. 2011). It has been suggested that degraded auditory input due to cochlear damage can trigger aberrant neuronal activity that is interpreted as tinnitus (Preece et al. 2003; Eggermont & Roberts 2014). The burden imposed by tinnitus is complex and extends beyond the persistence of the percept itself. The overall perceived handicap can include hearing difficulties, anxiety, depression, inability to relax, and sleep difficulties (Tyler & Baker 1983; Langguth 2011; McCormack et al. 2015). This heterogeneity in symptoms is reflected in the wide variety of proposed treatments, many of which are not supported by strong evidence for their effectiveness (Baguley et al. 2013).  Patients and clinicians agree that the management of tinnitus in those with profound hearing loss remains one of the top priorities for future tinnitus research (Hall et al. 2013). One potential device that has been proposed to manage tinnitus in the profoundly deaf is the cochlear implant (CI), which is an established intervention to restore useful aspects of hearing in these patients (Faulkner & Pisoni 2013). Cochlear implantation involves the surgical placement of an electrode array within the cochlea to stimulate spiral ganglion cells electrically to convey auditory information (Loizou 1998). On average, as many as 80% of candidates for cochlear implantation report experiencing tinnitus but the percept appears to subside in many after implantation (Baguley & Atlas 2007). As a result, it has been suggested that cochlear implantation should be considered as a treatment for tinnitus in the profoundly deaf (Tyler et al. 2008b). However, there remains a lack of comprehensive assessments of the burden of tinnitus and tinnitus-related symptoms after cochlear implantation (Baguley 2010) and therefore a lack of evidence for which symptoms may or may not be alleviated by implantation.  Many studies that have evaluated the impact of cochlear implantation on tinnitus have assessed outcome in terms of relief from the percept, for example, the reduction in tinnitus loudness (for a review see Baguley & Atlas 2007; Arts et al. 2012). Other studies have focused on designing and optimizing electrical stimulation strategies to suppress the percept (Chang & Zeng 2012; Arts et al. 2015). The assumption is that the suppression of tinnitus will alleviate its intrusiveness and reduce overall burden. However, although the number of profoundly deaf patients reporting tinnitus decreases following implantation, clinical observations suggest that a large proportion of CI recipients still experience some degree of tinnitus-related handicap (Pan et al. 2009; Bovo et al. 2011; Kloostra et al. 2015; Ramakers et al. 2015). A review of studies that have assessed the levels of tinnitus-related handicap following implantation suggested that about 25% of CI users experience a clinically significant tinnitus, that is, a degree of tinnitus-related handicap that may warrant intervention (Baguley 2010).  The presence of tinnitus after implantation may be explained by the finding that tinnitus is suppressed mostly when the implant is stimulating the auditory nerve and often reverts back to its original loudness (or becomes louder) soon after stimulation is turned off (Zeng et al. 2011; Vlastarakos et al. 2014). Therefore, it is plausible that tinnitus could be still bothersome in CI users at night time if the CI is switched off before going to sleep (Chadha et al. 2009), and consequently that they would not experience a reduction in the occurrence of tinnitus-related insomnia. However, despite the decades of research and converging evidence that sleep difficulties are one of the most common tinnitus-related complaints (Tyler & Baker 1983; Langguth 2011), the treatment of tinnitus-related insomnia remains an outstanding uncertainty for both clinicians and patients (Hall et al. 2013).Few studies have assessed the association between tinnitus and sleep difficulties in CI users, or whether the presence of tinnitus leads to sleep difficulties after patients turn their CI off at night time. One observational study on a small sample of adult CI users has suggested that implant use may reduce sleep difficulties in some, but not all, patients (Di Nardo et al. 2007), but the factors that contribute to that reduction remain unclear.""",Yes,"""Few studies have assessed the association between tinnitus and sleep difficulties in CI users, or whether the presence of tinnitus leads to sleep difficulties after patients turn their CI off at night time.

These results are compatible with previous studies that have demonstrated the potential for electrical stimulation to reduce the percept of tinnitus (for a review, see Baguley & Atlas 2007).  Tinnitus still appears to cause considerable distress in a subset of implanted individuals. However, the data available in the UK Biobank were mostly retrospective and based on self-report and may not accurately reflect participants’ overall level of tinnitus-related distress. The self-reports of CI users might have been influenced by their experience of hearing restoration and/or by the hearing and speech therapy they received following implantation (Pan et al. 2009). However, the lack of general quality of life assessments did not allow for these or other potential psychological effects on well-being and reported tinnitus persistence or distress to be controlled for. While tinnitus can be experienced throughout the day, participants in the UK Biobank were only asked to judge their level of tinnitus-related distress during the periods when their tinnitus is at its worst, for example, when their CI is switched off. If so, the present results may overstate the overall level of distress experienced by CI users. If distress had been measured throughout the day, the difference in distress reported by the CI and candidate groups may have been even more pronounced.  One possible explanation for the lower level of tinnitus persistence among CI users is that they may have regained access to sound following implantation that could suppress or mask their tinnitus and/or reduce the extent to which they attend to their tinnitus. These effects could plausibly lead to a decrease in the perceived loudness of tinnitus and potentially give some relief from tinnitus-related emotional distress. However, neither suppression nor reduced attention to tinnitus may be fully effective or lasting if only due to the fact that currently CI stimulation is optimized for speech perception and may not be optimal for the suppression of tinnitus (Chang & Zeng 2012). Thus, many CI users will likely still experience periods of loud and distressing tinnitus as they did before implantation.

Questions about sleep in the UK Biobank study were not asked in the context of tinnitus. Therefore, the reported difficulties with sleep may have been unrelated to tinnitus but related to other factors, for example, other age-related health problems. However, self-reported difficulties with sleep were highly prevalent in all participants reporting current tinnitus. This association between tinnitus presence and sleep difficulties was found even after controlling for neuroticism, a factor shown to be associated with both tinnitus (McCormack et al. 2014, 2015) and sleep problems (Hintsanen et al. 2014).  Sleep difficulties did not vary as a function of either tinnitus persistence or distress. This finding is consistent with the fact that participants were asked to rate distress based on how much the tinnitus “noises” upset them. Consequently, the reported distress was likely driven by hearing tinnitus persistently (Fig. 3) rather than sleep problems. Additional analyses also determined that the prevalence of sleep difficulties was not influenced by HA use or by poor speech perception (Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/EANDH/A294). Thus, the presence of sleep difficulties appears to be predicated primarily on whether tinnitus is present or not, and would therefore be expected to occur in a majority of those who experience tinnitus. It is perhaps not surprising therefore that insomnia was identified by patients and clinicians as one of the outstanding priorities for tinnitus research (Hall et al. 2013).  Tinnitus Before and After Implantation The present data cannot provide definitive estimates of the effect of implantation on tinnitus because it is not known whether tinnitus reported as occurring only in the past was abolished before or after implantation. If one assumes reporting moderately or severely distressing tinnitus as “significant” enough to consider additional tinnitus management options after implantation (Andersson et al. 2009), the estimate of 37% of CI users found in the present study (Table 3) would be somewhat higher than the 25% of “clinically significant” tinnitus estimated from data reported in other studies (Baguley 2010). If one also assumes that the candidate group was representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK, then the proportion of patients reporting current tinnitus of any kind (56%) was lower than the average estimate of 80% in CI candidates (lower limit of 67%) extrapolated from results of a number of studies (Baguley & Atlas 2007).

One possible explanation for these discrepancies is that the UK Biobank study sampled from the middle-aged UK population (40 to 69 years old) and therefore excluded both younger and older adult CI users and candidates.  Clinical Implications The absence of an association between tinnitus persistence, tinnitus distress, and difficulties with sleep reported here suggests that cochlear implantation may not be an appropriate intervention where the primary motivation is tinnitus suppression for the alleviation of tinnitus-related insomnia. Nevertheless, elevated sleep difficulties remain a significant contributor to perceived tinnitus-related emotional distress, and cases of undiagnosed insomnia may be present among tinnitus patients (Miguel et al. 2014). Insomnia management should therefore still be considered for any patient experiencing tinnitus, including CI users.  The results of the present study suggest that tinnitus is less persistent in those who use a CI compared with those identified as potential candidates for a CI despite similar prevalence of tinnitus in both groups. The results also suggest that the level of tinnitus persistence in CI users is similar to that observed in unaided participants with good speech perception in noise (Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/EANDH/A294). However, the limited information in the UK Biobank study on hearing loss and the type or number of devices used means that uncertainty remains as to whether (a) the difference in tinnitus persistence observed between CI users and potential candidates was a direct result of the devices used and (b) the subset of HA users identified as potential candidates were representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK. If the finding of lower tinnitus persistence among CI users compared with candidates is replicated in further observational and controlled studies, cochlear implantation could be considered as a potential treatment option for persistent and emotionally distressing tinnitus in those whose hearing loss may not otherwise make them a candidate. In those cases, implantation may have the potential to make tinnitus less persistent, possibly leading to a reduction in emotional distress.  The recognized breadth of observed symptoms among tinnitus patients has and continues to drive efforts toward delineating subtypes of tinnitus to provide tailored treatments and improve individual outcomes (Tyler et al. 2008a; Langguth 2011; COST Action BM1306: TINNET 2013). It is somewhat surprising therefore that, in the case of CI users, the focus appears to remain on suppressing the percept of tinnitus (Arts et al. 2012, 2015; Chang & Zeng 2012; Vlastarakos et al. 2014; Ramakers et al. 2015), with relatively less attention given to the characterization and management of other tinnitus-related symptoms. The present results suggest that CI users may experience a relief in tinnitus persistence, but not a complete abolition of tinnitus or tinnitus-related distress. Studies investigating other aspects of tinnitus handicap in CI users are encouraging (e.g., anxiety and depression; Andersson et al. 2009; Olze et al. 2011; Kloostra et al. 2015), but a more comprehensive characterization of tinnitus symptoms is still needed to understand the burden of tinnitus after cochlear implantation. It is only through such understanding that appropriate interventions for alleviating the burden of tinnitus in implant users can be identified and developed.""",Yes,"""If one also assumes that the candidate group was representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK, then the proportion of patients reporting current tinnitus of any kind (56%) was lower than the average estimate of 80% in CI candidates (lower limit of 67%) extrapolated from results of a number of studies (Baguley & Atlas 2007).

A previous study analysed the dietary intake in people consuming a reduced-carbohydrate diet (<40% calories). However, it is not clear what foods people consume when carbohydrate is reduced to below 26% of total calories. Methods: In the present cross-sectional study, the dietary and nutrient intake collected via up to five consecutive 24-h dietary recalls and a food frequency questionnaire of 444 individuals (aged 46-79 years) consuming <26% of calories from carbohydrate (LCHO) was compared with that of 131 897 individuals consuming ≥45% calories from carbohydrate (NCHO) using the UK Biobank Dataset.

Both LCHO groups reported consuming significantly more red meat, oily fish, nuts and seeds but fewer fruits, vegetables and pulses compared to the NCHO groups. In general, the consumption of oily fish, nuts, seeds and pulses was low across the whole cohort and differences in intake between the LCHO and NCHO groups were small. After adjusting for socio-economic status, most differences remained. Conclusions: Carbohydrate restriction is associated with both beneficial and potentially deleterious dietary changes compared to a normal carbohydrate intake.""",Yes,"""Introduction Low‐carbohydrate diets (LCHO) are becoming increasingly popular. In the UK, it was reported that 3 million people had tried the LCHO diet in 2003 1, with the Atkins diet books alone having sold over 45 million books in the latter half of the 20th century 2. Carbohydrate (CHO) restriction, where the restriction is sufficient and adhered to 3-5, appears to confer particular metabolic benefits for the management of type 2 diabetes 4, 6, including a reduction in post‐prandial glycaemia. However, the long‐term health effects in the wider population are not clear. This raises questions of its long‐term safety and efficacy, which warrants ongoing investigation into the dietary habits of such individuals 7, 8.  It is important to note that there is no singular definition of what constitutes a LCHO diet, although a CHO content comprising <26% of calories (or <130 g CHO) has been suggested as a cut‐off 9. Variations of the LCHO diet differ in their permitted levels of macronutrients, such as the low‐carbohydrate, high‐fat diet, which emphasises the importance of increasing fat consumption 10, whereas others increase protein to a greater degree 11. Absolute intakes (i.e. additional grammes) of protein or fat may not increase at all, mirroring a low calorie diet as a result of a reduced overall intake 12. The replacing food or macronutrient may also be an important determinant of the health effects of LCHO diets 4, 7, 8. However, most of the data on food and nutrient consumption in a LCHO diet have been collected in clinical trials 5-8, where participants are instructed to follow a particular dietary pattern. Therefore, to determine nutritional adequacy, it is important to establish what free‐living individuals on a CHO‐restricted diet are consuming.  A recent study compared the dietary intakes of individuals consuming fewer than 40% of calories from CHO with those who were consuming ≥40% in the UK. Although people on a reduced‐CHO diet consumed more red and processed meat and fewer fruits compared to those on a normal‐CHO diet, they also consumed more oily fish and vegetables 13. Therefore, CHO restriction may be associated with both healthy and less‐healthy dietary choices. A weakness of the study was the high cut‐off used to define the LCHO group with the aim of generating a sufficient number of subjects from the limited data available.""",Yes,"""A recent study compared the dietary intakes of individuals consuming fewer than 40% of calories from CHO with those who were consuming ≥40% in the UK.

Therefore, CHO restriction may be associated with both healthy and less‐healthy dietary choices. A weakness of the study was the high cut‐off used to define the LCHO group with the aim of generating a sufficient number of subjects from the limited data available. A lower boundary would be more likely to produce a group of individuals intentionally reducing their CHO intake and thus produce a more accurate representation of dietary and nutrient consumption. To identify sufficient numbers of people consuming a LCHO, a large sample size is required. The UK Biobank contains dietary and anthropometric data for more than 500 000 people.

Median daily consumption of fruit juices and sugar‐sweetened beverages was also significantly higher in the NCHO groups (P < 0.0001) (Table 2). People in the LCHO group (defined as CHO <26% kcal) reported an intake of red meat twice that of the NCHO group (≥45% kcal; red meat: 2.0 servings day–1, IQR = 0.5–3.33 versus 0.9 servings day–1, IQR = 0–1.5; P < 0.0001) (Table 2), although these differences were attenuated when LCHO was defined as <130 g day–1. There were also differences in the frequency of red meats (beef, lamb and pork) consumed, with a greater percentage of the <26% kcal group consuming these foods two or more times week compared to the ≥45% kcal group (see Supporting information, Table S1) and a greater percentage of the ≥45% reporting never consuming these foods compared to the <26% kcal group. However, once vegans and vegetarians were accounted for, there was no difference in the never‐consumers. Reported differences in frequency of intake of these food groups were minimised when LCHO was defined as <130 g day–1 from CHO (see Supporting information, Table S1). Processed meats were consumed with greater frequency in the NCHO group compared to the LCHO groups when defined by grammes (see Supporting information, Table S1). Median daily intake of nuts, seeds and oily fish was significantly higher in the LCHO groups (Table 2), although the intake of these items was relatively low, with only 20% of the whole cohort consuming the recommended amount of oily fish twice a week (see Supporting information, Table S1). Similarly, the NCHO groups consumed significantly more pulses than the LCHO groups, although the overall consumption of these items was low (Table 2).  More than half of both LCHO groups consumed butter as their spread of choice compared to one‐third of the NCHO groups (Table 3). People consuming a NCHO diet also reported a significantly greater amount and variety of fruits and vegetables consumed (Table 3). Of note, most people on both LCHO diets reported having consumed zero types of fruits across the 24‐h dietary recalls, with a further quarter having only one portion (Table 2). Similarly, a greater proportion of people on a LCHO diet reported consuming zero types of vegetables across the 24‐h dietary recalls, although there were no differences between the groups with respect to the percentage of people consuming more than four servings across the dietary recalls.  Intake of macro‐ and micronutrients The reported intakes of macronutrients, total sugar and fibre were all significantly different regardless of whether LCHO was calculated by kcal or the absolute number of grammes (Table 4). All groups exceeded the recommendations for saturated fat. Both LCHO groups reported a fibre intake of ≤11 g per day but, across all groups, fibre intake fell short of the current recommendations of the American Association of Analytical Chemists of 30 g day–1 (approximately 24 g fibre day–1 as calculated via the Englyst method used in UK Biobank).

",NA,No others,Yes,"""In this cross‐sectional study, the reported intakes of key foods and food groups differed between the LCHO and NCHO groups, although both groups included foods that were both beneficial and potentially deleterious to long‐term health.  Individuals in the NCHO groups reported consuming substantially more foods such as doughnuts, pastries, biscuits and chocolate compared to the LCHO groups. A potential advantage of LCHO diets includes the observation that, by reducing dietary CHO, such diets will inevitably reduce added sugars 13. Furthermore, because much of the added sugar in the UK diet comes from foods that are also high in fat, LCHO diets lead to a reduction in these energy‐dense, highly palatable items, which are over‐consumed across the UK population 28. The present analysis suggests this may be the case and the findings are supported by a cross‐sectional study in a US population reporting that added sugars provided 4% kcal in the LCHO group (<30% kcal from CHO) versus 21% in the high CHO group (>55% kcal from CHO) 29. Reverse causality cannot be ruled out, although a previous study also found that the reduction in CHO was associated with a selective reduction in added sugars 13. The UK Biobank dataset provides total sugars from all sources (all mono‐ and disaccharides, including those from milk and present in the structure of foods, such as fruit and vegetables) and so it is not possible to determine the association between the CHO restriction and added sugar restriction in the present study. In any case, to determine whether a LCHO diet leads to a specific reduction in added sugars, a prospective study in people intentionally following a LCHO diet would be required.  Similar to a previous analysis 13, the present study finds that individuals in the LCHO group consume higher quantities of meat, poultry and fish compared to people on a NCHO diet. In general, these differences were small and the statistical significance is a consequence of the large sample size in the study. Poultry appeared to be the most frequently consumed source of animal protein across the whole cohort and close to half of individuals reported consuming beef, lamb and pork less than once per week. This likely reflects the fact that the BIOBANK and similar volunteer cohorts tend to engage in healthier behaviours than the wider population 30. However, only 20% of people in the LCHO group and 15% in the NCHO groups met the current recommendations for oily fish consumption. The consumption of vegetable‐sources of protein was higher in the NCHO groups but, in general, they were consumed in small amounts across the cohort. Nuts, seeds and pulses are also high in micronutrients, fibre and other non‐nutritive components likely beneficial for health 31-33. Therefore, most individuals in the UK BIOBANK cohort would benefit from increasing their consumption of oily fish, nuts, seeds and pulses, irrespective of whether they are consuming a NCHO or LCHO diet.  Fruit and vegetable intake were calculated by summing each different fruit and vegetable that was consumed over each of the 24‐h dietary recalls and thus appeared high compared to typically reported intakes 13. Fruit was consumed much less frequently and in much less variety in the LCHO compared to the NCHO group, which might be a result of individuals on a LCHO diet attempting to avoid excessive ‘sugar’. Mono‐ and di‐saccharides are often referred to under the umbrella of ‘sugar’ in the lay press, despite lactose, glucose and fructose having substantially different glycaemic indices 34 and distinct metabolic effects. For example, fructose consumed in excess, and in particular in liquid form, is causally related to hepatic triglyceride deposition 35, whereas fruit consumed in typical quantities lowers post‐prandial glucose compared to starch and other sugars, without deleterious effects on metabolic function 36. If individuals are concerned about the glycaemic effect of whole fruits, advice could be offered on low‐glycaemic varieties.  The LCHO groups had a higher percentage of people consuming zero servings of vegetables over the five dietary recalls compared to the NCHO groups. Two previous studies have indicated that people consuming a LCHO eating pattern eat more vegetables, which may be due to their largely negligible available CHO content 13, 37. The difference in the present study may be that the LCHO group in the UK BIOBANK had higher material deprivation. Vegetables, when eaten in variety, can provide a substantial amount of fibres, micronutrients and non‐nutritive compounds 38. Fibre is particularly important when individuals are consuming fewer high‐fibre foods such as cereals, wholegrain breads and fruits. Notwithstanding the limitation of the LCHO data originating primarily from one 24‐dietary recall, it is of some concern that a large proportion of people report having zero vegetables. Individuals who aim to follow a LCHO diet should be counselled to consume sufficient vegetables, with an emphasis on the benefits for general and gastrointestinal health.  An oft‐cited concern regarding LCHO diets is that they may be deficient in key nutrients 2. In the present study, only potassium and magnesium were lower than the recommended intakes for the LCHO diets. Caution must be applied to these results because 24‐h dietary recalls can be unreliable for micronutrients 39. Nevertheless, potassium and magnesium are under‐consumed across the population, with lower intakes in reduced‐carbohydrate diets being reported previously 13, and potassium intake from 24‐h dietary recalls may be comparable to dietary records 39. Increasing the consumption of fruits (low‐glycaemic if necessary) and vegetables alongside, nuts, dairy products and oily fish would be a sensible, whole‐diet centred recommendation for people consuming both LCHO and NCHO diets.  To our knowledge, the calorie contribution of alcohol in LCHO diets has not been discussed at length previously. Alcohol consumption in this study is significantly higher in both LCHO groups than in the NCHO groups, even when the proportion of CHO is calculated from non‐alcohol kcal. If we calculate a LCHO diet from total energy intake (data not shown), alcohol contributes up to 16% of the calories consumed in the LCHO group. We note this because alcohol calories are not mentioned in documents suggesting cut‐offs for LCHO diets 9 and, accordingly, future analyses in this area should take this into account. Furthermore, alcohol intake should be considered within the context of CHO restriction and practitioners should work with patients to ensure that alcohol is not replacing CHO.""",Yes,see 18,Partially,"see 18. Does so for differences in group size but no other discussed sources of bias e.g. under/over reporting ""Therefore, the dietary intake of the LCHO reported in the present study has a greater margin of error compared to the NCHO diet. It is also important to recognise that there was a greater proportion of people in the LCHO groups whose data originate from only one dietary recall. """,Yes,"We offer some recommendations for further research in this area: given the very small number of people following a LCHO diet in a dataset with more than 200 000 dietary recalls available, future research may require a specific survey of people deliberately consuming a LCHO diet. This would also address the limitation of the present study in that we cannot be sure these individuals were intentionally following a LCHO diet. It would also be useful to determine the reason why people choose to follow the diet to observe whether this influences dietary choices such as the consumption of fruits.  In conclusion, the present study finds that self‐reported dietary intake in LCHO dietary patterns has both favourable and potentially adverse characteristics compared to a NCHO diet. The LCHO groups consumed fewer high‐sugar, high‐fat snack items, as well as fewer fruit and vegetables and more alcohol. In general, both LCHO and NCHO groups would benefit from increasing oily fish, pulses, and nuts and seeds.",Yes,"""Finally, the BIOBANK cohort is healthier than the general population 30, being predominantly Caucasian, and the LCHO groups are predominantly female.

Many studies have reported that a range of different blood-based inflammatory biomarkers are associated with an increased risk of incident CVD events.3–7 This initially led to an interest in reducing the risk of CVD by targeting patients with evidence of inflammation as illustrated by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.8 More recently, with genetic evidence supporting interleukin-6 pathway as causal in the development of CVD,9 interest has emerged in directly inhibiting specific parts of the inflammatory pathway to prevent CVD.10,11  One of the simplest, and most commonly measured markers of the immune response and inflammation, is the total white blood cell (WBC) count. Many studies have reported that an elevated WBC is associated with higher rates of incident CVD12–15 and non-CVD mortality.13,16 The association between elevated WBC and elevated CVD risk may indicate that infection and inflammation are part of the pathway leading to the development of CVD. However, WBC may also reflect poor health and risk of death from any cause and therefore be a nonspecific association.  Different subpopulations of WBC (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils) may also be associated with CVD and non-CVD mortality.14,17,18 In particular, elevated neutrophil counts may be associated with a higher risk of CVD in routine population data sets,18 although the influence of clinical susceptibility bias is difficult to account for in such databases, and the influence of reverse causality requires consideration.19 An additional consideration is that different associations in specific cell types may be suggestive of distinct pathways that lead to CVD. Although neutrophils (granulocytes that comprise the majority of circulating WBCs) can cause tissue damage, including in the walls of blood vessels via the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps,20 which in turn lead to macrophage-produced interleukin precursors,21 other white cell types such as monocytes (precursors of tissue macrophages) may also be important.22""",Yes,"""To explore these associations further, we examined the association between WBC and the differential leukocyte counts with all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, and non-CVD mortality in the UK Biobank population.""",Yes,"""To explore these associations further, we examined the association between WBC and the differential leukocyte counts with all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, and non-CVD mortality in the UK Biobank population.

Recent data from a large cohort study has shown that WBC was associated with coronary heart disease and cancer mortality among healthy women, even after excluding those with comorbidities (CVDs, connective tissue disease, ulcerative colitis, liver disease, diabetes mellitus, or cancers) and early deaths during follow-up.13 The association of WBC with CVD mortality among women in UK Biobank was fairly weak, but the association of neutrophils with CVD we report was strong in both sexes and is also similar to a recent large cohort study.18 Our sensitivity analysis attenuated associations of circulating leukocyte counts with mortality outcomes. This suggests an element of reverse causality.19 Mechanisms that explain this observation likely include the association between neutrophilia and trauma, stress, bacterial infection, smoking, and indolent cancer,29 any of which ultimately might increase the risk of death from any cause. Likewise, lymphopenia is likely to be caused by old age, viral infection, autoimmune disease, renal failure, and immunosuppressive drugs.30 By excluding those with a range of baseline diseases, and those who develop disease within 2 years of baseline, the present results provide models that limit the effect of baseline disease on counts themselves.  What mechanisms might explain the association of leukocytes with CVD mortality? The inflammatory hypothesis of CVD is well established.31 Underpinning this, cellular atherosclerotic plaques appear more prone to rupture.32 It is hypothesized that leukocytes may play a direct role in destabilizing the plaque itself33,34 through fibrous cap thinning, although it may be that circulating levels of leukocytes do not necessarily reflect resident cells within atherosclerotic plaques. Investigating specific differential counts, our data suggest that high circulating neutrophil levels are linearly associated with CVD mortality that occurs beyond a 2-year time horizon in ostensibly healthy people. The same does not seem to be true of other leukocytes. It is interesting that, until recently, neutrophils were a neglected leukocyte in atherosclerosis research. There are clear mechanisms that might explain why neutrophils might play an important role in causing CVD death.35 Neutrophils interact with cholesterol crystals to produce pro-IL-1β.20 They can form structures that bind bacteria and platelets, the end result of which is that neutrophils release nuclear material leading to cell death and thrombosis.36 Neutrophils are, therefore, intimately linked to the inflammatory cascade, which can be promoted through a proatherogenic environment. Other environmental factors, such as smoking,37 might also promote neutrophilia and CVD death, resulting in confounding. However, our sensitivity analysis suggests that there may be an independent association too. Inhibiting IL-1β in patients with established CVD reduces cardiovascular events10,25 and strongly reduces circulating neutrophil counts.26,27 Our findings suggest that further work should be done in patients without preexisting CVD to determine whether IL-1β blockers, or other modulators of the immune response to inflammation, may have a role to play in the prevention of CVD and the role of neutrophils in this context.  Higher neutrophil counts were also associated with a higher risk of non-CVD death. Here, the association may be even more complex. Specific non-CVD conditions may be linked to higher neutrophil counts through different pathways. For instance, there is evidence that people with chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis have increased risk of death beyond that caused by CVD (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.22752/abstract). There has also been speculation that tumor-infiltrating neutrophils may be important in the prognosis of several types of cancer (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044579X13000138). As noted above, mechanisms that may underlie the associations we observe include the influence of indolent malignancy (both solid organ and hematological) and other confounders such as inflammatory diseases and smoking. Although we corrected for as many of these as possible through multivariable analysis and sensitivity analysis, there remains a significant element of confounding and reverse causality. More work is required to examine the association between neutrophils and specific non-CVD causes of death to determine potential mechanisms underlying our findings.  Our study has many strengths. The UK Biobank includes a wide sample of the UK general population in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status and as such is not derived from health records of patients with a clinical indication for leukocyte measurement, in contrast to prior work.18 Further strengths of the study include its large sample size, comprehensive phenotyping, and simultaneous consideration of differential leukocyte counts derived from a central laboratory measurement, also in contrast to prior work.18 The side-by-side comparison of CVD and non-CVD mortality gives an indication of the specificity of associations, although we did not further subdivide non-CVD morality because of lack of adjudicated outcomes. It is notable that inflammatory markers seem to have a stronger association with CVD mortality than with nonfatal events.38,39 Weaknesses include the lack of data to adjust for lipids, although the extensive adjustment model will capture much of this confounding by proxy. Lack of adjustment for medication is a further limitation, although again adjustment for comorbidity accounts for much of the association. Reverse causality is possible in any observational study, and although our results include a sensitivity analysis and an analysis excluding those with diagnosed comorbidities, we cannot exclude the potential of further reverse causality explaining some of the associations that we report.  In conclusion, we report that among leukocytes, higher neutrophil count is particularly associated with higher CVD risk in a general population. This association seems to be robust in those without comorbidity at baseline or in those who may have unrecognized disease at baseline. Further work is required to determine whether modulation of the immune responses that involve neutrophils, via canakinumab or other interventions, can lead to a reduction in CVD mortality.""",No,,Yes,"""The work in this study was supported by a grant from Chest, Heart, and Stroke Association Scotland (Res16/A165).""",No,,No,,No,,,paul.welsh@glasgow.ac.uk,UK,9310,"cardiovascular disease, epidemiology, inflammation, leukocyte count, neutrophils",,,

INTRODUCTION Ménière’s disease, a disorder of the inner ear, defined by episodes of vertigo, aural fullness, tinnitus, and sensorineural hearing loss, afflicts hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide (Sajjadi & Paparella 2008). Currently, our understanding of the disease etiology remains obscure. It is a complex multifactorial disease with a range of risk factors implicated including family history (genetic and/or childhood environment) (Gazquez & Lopez-Escamez 2011), viral infection (Williams et al. 1987), allergy (Derebery & Berliner 2010), autoimmunity (Gazquez et al. 2011), and nervous system dysfunction (e.g., migraine; Peroutka 2004) all identified as potential contributory factors (Tyrrell et al. 2014a).  Concomitant diseases and other risk factors such as family history, viral infection, and allergy suggest that early-life exposures may contribute to an individual’s risk of developing Ménière’s. However, to date, very limited information is available on the role of early-life exposure in developing Ménière’s. Furthermore, the Barker Hypothesis may also play a role in disease etiology (Hales et al. 1991). A key proxy for differing exposures in intrauterine, perinatal, and early childhood is adult anthropometric measures, especially leg length. Poor maternal and childhood health, insufficient diet (energy intake was positively associated with leg length; beta 0.0027 [0.0013–0.0041]) (Wadsworth et al. 2002), adverse family circumstances (e.g., socioeconomic status [SES] and overcrowding in early childhood both reduce adult leg length by approximately 10–15 cm; Li et al. 2007), and maternal smoking during pregnancy are each known to reduce leg length, independent of birth weight (Gunnell et al. 1998; Wadsworth et al. 2002; Gunnell et al. 2003; Li et al. 2007).  Numerous studies have demonstrated that taller adults have lower risks of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity (Whitley et al. 2012). Furthermore, studies have indicated that leg length is the main contributor to this association (Gunnell et al. 2003), with trunk length associations, weaker or absent. The mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. The prepubertal linear growth occurs more in the leg than in the trunk (Whitley et al. 2012), and leg length may be a particularly sensitive marker of adverse prepubertal environmental factors that affect growth. Studies have also demonstrated that leg length was sensitive to infant (younger than 5 years) socioeconomic circumstance and diet (Wadsworth et al. 2002). Leg length in childhood is robustly correlated with leg length in adulthood. Shorter leg length has been associated with a number of adulthood diseases including coronary heart disease (CHD) (Lawlor et al. 2004) and type 2 diabetes (Lawlor et al. 2002).

Ménière’s Diagnosis During a nurse-led interview, all participants in the UK Biobank were asked what doctor-diagnosed health conditions they experienced from. The nurse then recorded the disease(s) reported in a predetermined list. If the participant was uncertain about an illness, the condition was described to the interviewer who attempted to place it within the list, with the help of a doctor if necessary. There were several options for ear/vestibular disorders: tinnitus, vertigo, labyrinthitis, Ménière’s disease, otosclerosis, or a generic ear/vestibular disorder. We selected all individuals who had reported having Ménière’s (n = 1376). While self-reported, we anticipate that our Ménière’s variable is valid as these individuals reported current tinnitus and hearing loss (Tyrrell et al. 2014a). Furthermore, the majority participants who recorded Meniere’s disease also recorded a prescription of betahistine and vestibular sedatives at the time of the UK Biobank baseline questionnaire, reflecting the current UK prescribing practice for Ménière’s and they also reported avoiding salt, caffeine, and alcohol, which is common clinical advice for individuals with Ménière’s (Tyrrell et al. 2014a).  The controls were all individuals who did not report Ménière’s.  Diabetes and CHD Participants were defined as having type 2 diabetes if they had answered yes to the question “Has a doctor ever told you that you have diabetes?” and had not reported using insulin within the first year of diagnosis. We excluded individuals who reported that they were diagnosed under the age of 35 to limit the numbers of individuals with slow-progressing autoimmune diabetes or monogenic forms of diabetes. CHD was defined as a self-reported diagnosis of angina, heart attack, or heart failure.  Components of Adult Height Standing and sitting height (trunk length) variables were available in the UK Biobank for 496,318 participants. Standing and seated heights were measured using a Seca 202 device (Seca, UK). We excluded individuals defined by classic criteria to be of small stature (height <148 cm; n = 1573) (Vance et al. 2012). We then calculated leg length (total height minus trunk length) and leg-to-trunk ratio. We further excluded 261 participants with leg length greater than 120 cm and less than 60 cm.

When we only included individuals with Ménière’s on betahistine (n = 599) as cases, we saw similar associations for height (OR, 0.88 [0.81–0.96]) and leg length (OR, 0.92 [0.85–1.00]) per quintile increase""",NA,Not used,Yes,"""Ménière’s was noted to be more prevalent in older, female individuals of white origin, and with higher BMI as previously noted (Sajjadi & Paparella 2008). For the first time, we demonstrated inverse associations existed between Ménière’s and the components of adult height. We also observed that higher IMD scores (representing greater deprivation) for place of birth was associated with increased odds of Ménière’s.  The crude results show a similar level of association between the diagnosis of Ménière’s disease and any of the individual components of adult height, that is, total height, leg length, and trunk length. This observation is in accordance with previous research showing that total adult height is associated with lower rates of a number of chronic diseases (Davey Smith et al. 2000) although the physiological mechanisms behind this are not always clear (Bray et al. 2006).  After adjusting for potential confounders in the form of age, BMI, CHD, diabetes, ethnicity, sex, smoking, and social class as defined by education, trunk length ceases to be a significant predictor of the diagnosis of Ménière’s disease, and it appears that overall height and leg length are the components of adult height most strongly associated with the disease. This finding is consistent, when tested in all cases and controls, in cases versus age- and sex-matched controls and in a subgroup analysis of women only. In a subgroup analysis of men only, no component of height was found to be a significant predictor of Ménière’s disease after adjustment for confounders.""",Yes,"""We acknowledge some limitations with our data. The disease diagnosis was self-reported; however, people were also able to select vestibular disorder, tinnitus, vertigo, and labyrinthitis which, along with the presence and advice of a trained nurse, should have reduced the number of people incorrectly reporting Ménière’s. Furthermore, the self-reported Ménière’s sufferers had increased odds of Ménière’s-type symptoms and reporting the use of Ménière’s medication and commonly used dietary self-management. It is possible that the people reporting Ménière’s in the UK Biobank are incorrectly diagnosed. Ménière’s is particularly difficult to diagnose in the early stages of the disease. We performed a sensitivity analysis where we excluded individuals diagnosed in the 5 years before recruitment to the UK Biobank, as it is anticipated that in this time frame, newly diagnosed individuals will undergo a range of tests that might suggest misdiagnosis (Sajjadi & Paparella 2008).  There may be participants in the UK Biobank who have Meniere’s disease but are not yet diagnosed, but as the prevalence was 0.27% which is similar to prior studies, we believe this number to be small. The recruitment strategy of the UK Biobank meant that it is not a representative sample of the British population (borne out by the under-representation of ethnic minorities), and selection criteria also limit it to the 40- to 70-year-old age range. Volunteer bias may have occurred, with more people with health conditions volunteering than healthy individuals. Healthy participant bias may also operate in the opposing direction with relatively fit people participating, as some travel to recruitment centers were involved (with a large proportion of participants past the retirement age participating). Finally, we used the cross-sectional baseline data of the UK Biobank; however, as we are investigating associations between Ménière’s and height, we can assume that factors contributing to height occurred before the diagnosis of Ménière’s in most individuals.  Other unmeasured factors not considered in the analyses may underlie the associations; for example, growth-regulating genes may be independently associated with Ménière’s. Genetics currently explain approximately 12% of the variation in adult height although it is anticipated that more variants will be identified in the future. We were unable to investigate the role of genetics within this study; future work should consider the associations while accounting for known height variants. Alternatively, taller individuals are considered to be more successful in later life (Case & Paxson 2006), and this may protect against Ménière’s rather than some growth-influencing exposure. Our previous work suggested an inverse association between educational attainment and Ménière’s (Tyrrell et al. 2014a).  We were also unable to account for changes in height due to aging. However, age-related changes in height are predominantly attributed to shrinkage of the trunk, and therefore, our findings for leg length, the well-defined marker of an adverse childhood environment, will not be altered (Fernihough & McGovern 2014), suggesting that our findings are accurate.""",Yes,se 19_i,Yes,"""This study provides evidence of an inverse association between Ménière’s disease and stature.

These studies demonstrated that adult height and particularly leg length were inversely associated with disease prevalence in adulthood. A recent study demonstrated an association between leg length and metabolic disorders underlying type 2 diabetes, including lower insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function (Johnston et al. 2013). Previous studies into Ménière’s have suggested an association between the disease and insulin resistance (Lavinsky et al. 2013)...This study demonstrated robust associations between Ménière’s and the components of adult height, with consistent associations with leg length after adjusting for various confounders. The specific association between leg length and Ménière’s may suggest that early-life environmental exposures that influence skeletal growth also influence Ménière’s risk in later life. This is feasible as factors that influence skeletal growth are likely to impact on the development of the nervous and immune systems, both of which are implicated in Ménière’s etiology (Tyrrell et al. 2014a).

Introduction Fragility fractures, sarcopenia (the presence of low skeletal muscle mass and function), and frailty are becoming more prevalent in our aging society with their attendant disabilities and costs for health and social care. Moreover, maintaining mobility and wellbeing in our aging society is important. The costs of falls and fractures are £2.3 billion per year in the UK ($17 billion in the US), with one in two women and one in five men experiencing a fracture over the age of 50 years [1,2]. Estimates of the costs of sarcopenia are $US18.5B, and they are set to rise [3]. Osteoporosis (the presence of low bone density, BMD) is a well-recognised risk factor for fragility fractures [4,5,6,7], but more recently the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass, function and sarcopenia, as well as frailty, have also been recognised as risk factors for osteoporosis, falls, and fractures [6,7,8]. Skeletal muscle provides protection through hormonal or endocrine interactions between muscle and bone, muscle force generated mechanical signals, and maintenance of postural balance. So, conserving skeletal muscle mass and function is important for prevention of fractures [9,10,11]. Both osteoporosis and sarcopenia are highly prevalent. Estimates for the prevalence of osteoporosis in the community are 22.1% and 5.5% in European women and men, aged 50 years and over [1]. In the USA 77.1% of women and 10.0% of men, over the age of 65 years have either osteoporosis or low bone density [12]. Sarcopenia has been identified in between 1% and 29% in community dwelling people over the age of 60 years, with estimates for those living in long term care of between 14% and 33% [13,14]. Recent predictions for Europe estimate that the prevalence of sarcopenia will almost double overall in the elderly population to 22.3% by 2045 [13,14]. The prevalence of frailty is 25% in those over the age in 80 [12]. It is clear that the prevalence of all these conditions (osteoporosis, sarcopenia and frailty, and number of fractures) will rise in line with the increasing age of populations in the UK and USA, as will the costs of health and social care for their treatment [3,13,15,16]. Prior to a diagnosis of these conditions, gradual losses in bone density and skeletal muscle mass and strength (sarcopenic risk factors) occur in a continuum starting from the age 30 years, with increasing rates of loss in those over the age of 60 years [17,18]. Importantly, these conditions, once present, are difficult to reverse and current treatment strategies are limited. Therefore, maintaining skeletal muscle and bone health during aging is important in our populations, and new preventative strategies in middle and younger older ages (middle age 40–60 years, younger older age 60 to 70 years) are needed. Dietary composition can impact on the mechanisms leading to age-related loss of bone density, skeletal muscle mass or function. Calcium is well established as essential for bone health, as is protein for skeletal muscle, but other nutrients that are integral to bone and muscle physiology, such as magnesium (Mg), have not been investigated extensively and concurrently in relation to both skeletal muscle and bone health in both men and women of middle and younger older age [19,20,21,22,23]. The mechanism by which Mg may protect against osteoporosis and sarcopenic risk factors may be through the protection from cytokine induced stimulation of osteoclast activity or the protection of loss of skeletal muscle mass or strength. For osteoporosis, Mg can influence osteoblast activity as well as hydroxyapatite crystal formation, and regulation of calcium homeostasis through interactions between parathyroid hormone and vitamin D [24,25]. For skeletal muscle, Mg has direct physiological and metabolic roles, including maintenance of protein synthesis and turnover. Mg may also affect muscle performance though energy metabolism (production of ATP), transmembrane transport, and muscle contraction and relaxation [26,27]. Moreover, skeletal muscle and bone contain the majority of Mg in the body with 60% found in bone and 27% in muscle, indicating the importance of Mg to the musculoskeletal system [28]. Understanding the gender specific differences in associations between diet and skeletal muscle and bone health is important, as men attain a higher proportion of skeletal muscle mass, grip strength, and BMD at younger ages than women. Also, the effects of aging differ, with men losing a higher percentage of muscle mass and a lower percentage of BMD than women as they age. Few studies have investigated the sarcopenic risk factors with dietary magnesium in middle and older aged populations and even fewer investigated these associations according to gender. Grip strength has only been investigated in five previous studies with dietary or supplemental Mg intake or blood concentrations, and only one of these was in men [20,21,27,29,30]. Even fewer studies have investigated the associations between Mg and skeletal muscle mass, with none investigating associations in men only [20,21,29,30]. Of the greater number of studies investigating dietary magnesium and bone density, most were in older women (34), with only five investigating associations independently in men [25,31,32,33,34].""",Yes,"""To our knowledge, no studies have previously investigated dietary Mg and measures of both bone and skeletal muscle health concurrently in the same cohort, independently in men and women.

In order to control for increases in FFM with height and weight, the following indices were used [39].

Secondly, FFM divided by BMI (FFMBMI) was calculated since this takes into account the increase in body size, scaled for height, and it was calculated as total FFM divided by BMI [40]. Thirdly, total appendicular lean mass (ALM) was used because skeletal muscle mass in the limbs is more directly related to issues of mobility and the onset of sarcopenia was calculated as the sum of FFM in the arms and legs. ALM was scaled by BMI (ALMBMI) calculated as ALM divided by BMI [40]. Bone Mineral Density. The Sahara Clinical Bone Sonometer was used to estimate bone mineral density (BMD) based on ultrasound measurement of the calcaneus (heel) [41]. In the early stages of recruitment, only a single heel was used for the measurement, but in the later stages, measurements were made on both heels. The average of the two heel estimates was used in this study if both were available; otherwise, the single value was used (0.71% (n = 545) of the measurements that were used in our analyses were made the left had side only, and 0.76% (n = 581) of measurements were made on the right hand side only).""",Yes,"""2.3. Measurement of Magnesium Intake Dietary intake was assessed using the Oxford WebQ, a computerised 24-h recall questionnaire that was self-completed online on up to five occasions [42,43].

The Oxford WebQ questionnaire consists of 200 food items with associated choices of standard portion units or portion sizes [42,43]. This questionnaire has been validated against an interviewer-administered 24-h recall, with only small differences being found between the intakes of nutrients using both methods [43]. Intakes of nutrients from this questionnaire were calculated using composition data taken from McCance and Widdowson’s The Composition of Food and its supplements [43].

Binary variables for Mg, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation were derived from questions on supplement taking, including multivitamins and minerals. If a participant had answered that they had taken a relevant supplement on any of the food questionnaires, then this was coded as “yes”. To estimate potential misreporting of diet, the ratio of reported energy intake (EI) to estimated energy expenditure (EER) (EI:EER ratio), was calculated and adjusted for in the analyses [45]. The EER was calculated based on equations for men or women aged 19 years and older from the US Dietary Reference Intakes, and these equations were applied according to the BMI of participants; greater or less than 25 kg/m2 [45].

These exclusions left a total of 156,575 people in the study (73,323 men and 82,098 women in the muscle analyses, 36,118 men and 40,441 women in the BMD analysis).  2.6. Statistical Analysis We examined the association between dietary Mg, skeletal muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density using multivariable regression techniques. First, for men and women separately, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of each outcome variable for each sex-specific quintile of dietary Mg (model 1). Then, we fitted Mg quintiles as the predictor in an adjusted model, again for men and women separately, with the covariates included. For this adjusted model, we calculated adjusted means with standard errors of each outcome for each sex-specific quintile of dietary Mg (model 2). For both models, we tested for a trend (p value given as p trend in the tables) in these unadjusted (model 1) and adjusted (model 2) values by fitting the median value of the outcome variable within each quintile as a continuous variable. Model 2 was also adjusted for sex-specific quintile of percentage energy from protein, smoking status, age group, physical activity levels, dietary energy intake, the ratio of EI:EER, the number of food questionnaires completed, whether the participant took Mg supplements, and, for women, whether the participant took HRT and whether she had experienced menopause. For the measures of skeletal muscle mass and strength, we also adjusted for whether the participant had taken cholesterol-lowering drugs. For BMD, we also adjusted for BMI, dietary calcium, dietary vitamin D, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. For grip strength, we additionally adjusted for height. To determine whether there might be a different relationship between Mg and the outcomes of interest by age, we repeated the analyses stratified by age (<60 years and ≥60 years).

This is important as these factors are associated with an increased risk of falls, frailty, sarcopenia, and fractures. Higher intakes of dietary Mg were positively associated with a greater grip strength, indices of skeletal muscle mass, and BMD in both men and women aged 39–72 years continuously across the distribution of intakes. The inter-quintile differences associated with dietary Mg ranged from 1.1% and 2.4% for grip strength to 5.1% and 5.5% for FFMBMI, in men and women, respectively, but were smaller for BMD being 2.9% and 0.9%. When comparing these differences with previously measured longitudinal annual losses of skeletal muscle mass, grip strength and bone density, the associations found across the distribution of Mg intake ranged from one quarter in men to three quarters in women, for grip strength, and from 3 times in men to 5.1 times in women for FFM%. For BMD, these comparisons were 1.9 times in women and 9.7 times in men. Moreover, the associations were in the main of a similar scale in younger, as well as older, men and women, indicating that dietary Mg has relevance for protection for skeletal muscle and bone outcomes both in middle and younger older age groups. In men over the age of 60 years, the interquintile differences found in grip strength were around twice that of younger men. Whilst these findings are cross-sectional, they indicate that it is likely to be important for older men to consume sufficient dietary magnesium. Our findings were also significant after statistical adjustment for the important factors that contribute to skeletal muscle and bone loss: Age, smoking, and physical activity, and in women, HRT medication. For skeletal muscle our results remained significant after adjustment for dietary protein, which has been traditionally regarded as the most important nutrient for skeletal muscle health. For bone density, we also accounted for dietary and supplemental intakes of calcium. Thus, our results are independent of protein for muscle and of calcium for bone which have well established structural and physiological roles for musculoskeletal health. Mg also has important metabolic, physiological, and structural roles in the musculoskeletal system""",Yes,"""One of limitations of this study is that it is a cross-sectional design and so we cannot infer causation. Also, since we excluded individuals of non-Caucasian background, our findings may not apply to those of different ethnic origin. Body composition was measured with BIA, which is considered as less precise than measurements made with DXA, although BIA is regarded as accurate in healthy individuals [56,60]. However, the method used for this study is single frequency BIA and so may underestimate the loss of skeletal muscle mass as compared with measurements made with multi-frequency BIA [61]. Heel BMD was measured by ultrasound attenuation rather than DXA, but previous studies have found that ultrasound methods are associated with osteoporotic risk factors and predict the incidence of fractures [62,63]. Although the self-reported measurements of physical activity we used are less precise than objective measures, they do distinguish across the range of activity levels for individuals [64].""",Partially,"Do not estimate magnitude ""However, the method used for this study is single frequency BIA and so may underestimate the loss of skeletal muscle mass as compared with measurements made with multi-frequency BIA [""",Partially,"Do not acknowledge limitations is conclusions ""Our research has found positive associations between greater intakes of dietary Mg and grip strength, indices of skeletal muscle mass, and BMD in men and women in middle and older age groups.

Our findings indicate that it is likely to be important to consume sufficient Mg as well as protein for the health of skeletal muscle, as well as calcium for bone.

Former heavy (>20/day) smokers were also more likely to report short (<6 h) sleep duration (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.25–1.60; P < 0.001), long-sleep duration (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.47–2.71; P < 0.001) and sleeplessness (OR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.38–1.57; P < 0.001) than never smokers.

Existing global tobacco control interventions need to be enforced.""",Yes,"""Worldwide, sleep disturbance affects more than one-third of the adult general population,1 and the prevalence is rising partly due to the ageing population and increasing urbanisation.2,3 The proportion of the English population taking sleep medication has doubled since 1983.4 Symptoms of sleep disturbance include sleeplessness or insomnia, short- and long-sleep duration, difficulty awakening in the morning and signs of daytime dysfunction, such as daytime sleepiness.5  Sleep disturbance predisposes to poor health, including cardiovascular diseases and mental health problems.6,7 Short (<6 h/day) and long (>9 h/day) sleep duration are particularly associated with increased risk of diabetes,8 cardiovascular diseases9 and memory impairment.10 Meta-analyses of cohort studies11,12 have consistently shown an increased mortality risk in persons reporting short- or long-sleep duration. Economic implications of sleep disturbance cannot be overlooked and include increased absenteeism and lost productivity,13 more accidents14 and increased healthcare utilisation and costs.13 In the USA, the annual economic burden of sleep disturbance has been estimated at $100 billion,13 and the National Health Service (NHS) in England spends around £50 million on sleep medication each year.15  It is evident that nicotine can stimulate the release of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine16 which, in turn, may inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and sleep-promoting neurons located in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), causing excessive arousal of the body.17 Electroencephalography (EEG) reports have also revealed marked differences in sleep waves between smokers and non-smokers, with smokers having frequent arousals.18 There is strong evidence that smoking cessation is associated with poor sleep;19 however, previous studies on active smoking and sleep characteristics have produced conflicting results. For instance, while some studies have reported positive associations between active smoking and sleep disturbance,20–25 others have reported no association26–32 or even negative associations.33–35 Furthermore, research is lacking into whether exposure to passive smoking is associated with sleep disturbance.

However, participants are not necessarily representative in terms of lifestyle. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to generalise summary statistics, such as prevalence, to the general population. However, estimates of the magnitude of associations, such as between tobacco and sleep, should be generalisable. In common with most epidemiological studies of sleep, sleep characteristics were self-reported; objective measurement of parameters such as sleep duration would, however, not be feasible within such a large study. It is also important to mention that the questions used to evaluate sleep disturbance were not from a validated scale such as the General Sleep Disturbance Scale. Smoking characteristics were also self-reported; reports of smoking status and level of exposure could not be corroborated by objective measures such as cotinine assay. Whilst we adjusted for a wide range of potential confounders, residual confounding is always possible within any observational study. For instance, we used self-reported depression and stress as a proxy for mental health and it is possible that these do not completely measure overall mental health. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders and are also associated with sleep disturbance and probably initiation of cigarette smoking, but we could not adjust for anxiety in our analysis. Additionally, since this was a cross-sectional study, it was not possible to determine the temporal relationship between smoking and sleep; therefore, reverse causation cannot be excluded. For example, sleep disturbance might lead to mental disorders such as anxiety and depression.51 There is some evidence to suggest that poor stress control and anxiety disorders are among the factors that predict initiation of cigarette smoking.52,5""",No,,Partially,"Makes a policy suggestion despite limitations ""Tobacco exposure is known to directly increase the risk of many diseases including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and many cancers.54 Our study suggests that there is also an association between tobacco exposure and a number of sleep characteristics.

Smoking prevalence and exposure to passive smoking are declining in many developed countries. However, these improvements are more than offset by increases in highly populated, developing, and newly industrialised countries such as China. As a result, the global prevalence of active smoking and passive exposure to tobacco is expected to continue increasing over the next few decades.55 Currently, ~6 million deaths are attributed to smoking every year, of which 0.6 million are associated with passive smoke exposure.56 It may be beneficial to enforce the existing global tobacco control interventions to reduce the impact on a wide range of health parameters, including sleep disturbance""",Yes,"""The UK Biobank is representative of the UK general population, within the age range recruited, in terms of age, sex, ethnic and socioeconomic breakdown.

We sought to verify this in lifelong non-smokers, among whom confounding by active smoking can be excluded, and investigate associations with circulatory and cancer deaths.  Methods In UK Biobank, among 149 343 white never-smokers aged 40–69 years at entry, 2401 deaths occurred over a mean of 6.5-year follow-up. In the Health Surveys for England (HSE) 1995, 1996, 2001 and Scottish Health Surveys (SHS) 1998 and 2003 combined, there were 500 deaths among 6579 white never-smokers aged 40–69 years at entry, followed for a mean of 13.9 years. SD (z) scores for forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were derived using Global Lung Initiative 2012 reference equations. These z-scores were related to deaths from all causes, circulatory disease and cancers using proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, height, socioeconomic status, region and survey.""",Yes,"""Results In the HSE–SHS data set, decreasing z-scores for FEV1 (zFEV1) and FVC (zFVC) were each associated to a similar degree with increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratios per unit decrement 1.17, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25 for zFEV1 and 1.19, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.28 for zFVC). This was replicated in Biobank (HRs 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.26 and 1.24, 1.19 to 1.29, respectively). zFEV1 and zFVC were less strongly associated with mortality from circulatory diseases in HSE–SHS (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.40 for zFVC) than in Biobank (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.60 for zFVC). For cancer mortality, HRs were more consistent between cohorts (for zFVC: HRs 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.24 in HSE–SHS and 1.10, 1.05 to 1.15 in Biobank). The strongest associations were with respiratory mortality (for zFVC: HRs 1.61, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.08 in HSE–SHS and 2.15, 1.77 to 2.61 in Biobank).  Conclusions Spirometric indices predicted mortality more strongly than systolic blood pressure or body mass index, emphasising the importance of promoting lung health in the general population, even among lifelong non-smokers.""",Partially,"Do not explain what FEV1 or FVC are ""Four decades of epidemiological research have consistently shown that reduced levels of ventilatory function, measured as one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FVC), are associated with higher all-cause mortality rates, and therefore shorter survival in the general population.1–7 Few studies have reported specifically on lifelong non-smokers,3 4 a group which form the minority of most populations surveyed hitherto, but are set to become more common in future as smoking becomes less prevalent in higher income countries.  Most publications have focused on FEV1, but a recent analysis7 of asymptomatic participants in the multiethnic Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study reported that all-cause mortality was strongly associated with diminished FVC, after adjustment for FEV1, but not the other way around, and there was no association between survival and the ratio of FEV1 to FVC.

Modelling of mortality The relationship of spirometric indices with subsequent mortality was modelled by proportional hazards (Cox) regression, which estimates the relative increase in mortality rate (HR) for a unit change in each explanatory variable. The z-scores are expressed on a SD scale, so HRs for zFEV1 and zFVC are expressed per unit decrement (ie, an increase in risk for a decrease in lung function). A typical range of z-scores among lifelong non-smokers would be 4 units. A HR of 1.2 per unit decrement corresponds approximately to a twofold difference in mortality rate across this range.  Due to the high correlation between zFEV1 and zFVC among lifelong non-smokers (0.88 in Biobank, 0.80 in national health survey participants aged 40–69 years), we modelled the association of mortality with zFEV1 both alone and jointly with zFEVFVC, and similarly for zFVC.

The significance of the HR for zFEVFVC when modelled jointly with zFEV1 was used to assess whether zFVC predicted mortality independent of zFEV1, and vice versa when zFEVFVC was modelled jointly with zFEV1.  All proportional hazards models were restricted to white participants and adjusted for sex, age, standing height, socioeconomic status and region. Analyses of data from the five national health surveys were additionally adjusted for survey year as a categorical variable. Since each survey was conducted in a different year, inclusion of survey year in the model is closely equivalent to a fixed-effect meta-analysis of the results from each of the five surveys. In a more formal two-stage individual participant meta-analysis for all-cause mortality in lifelong non-smokers, there was no substantial or significant heterogeneity of HRs among the five national health surveys (I²=0.0%, p=0.775 for zFEV1; I²=10.5%, p=0.346 for zFVC). Therefore, for simplicity of presentation we report results for the five national surveys combined, but analyse UKB separately because one of our objectives is to investigate how closely these two sets of results correspond. Heterogeneity between HRs for the pooled national surveys and UKB was assessed by testing the significance of the difference between the corresponding log-HRs from these two data sets.

Outlying observations were excluded by restricting all the analyses in both data sets to values of zFEV1 and zFVC within the range −5 to +5 z-score units. This exclusion removed 0.2% of UKB participants, 0.5% of participants in the national health surveys aged 40–69 years and 0.3% of national health survey participants aged 70 years or more.  Modelling of mortality The relationship of spirometric indices with subsequent mortality was modelled by proportional hazards (Cox) regression, which estimates the relative increase in mortality rate (HR) for a unit change in each explanatory variable. The z-scores are expressed on a SD scale, so HRs for zFEV1 and zFVC are expressed per unit decrement (ie, an increase in risk for a decrease in lung function). A typical range of z-scores among lifelong non-smokers would be 4 units. A HR of 1.2 per unit decrement corresponds approximately to a twofold difference in mortality rate across this range.  Due to the high correlation between zFEV1 and zFVC among lifelong non-smokers (0.88 in Biobank, 0.80 in national health survey participants aged 40–69 years), we modelled the association of mortality with zFEV1 both alone and jointly with zFEVFVC, and similarly for zFVC. Among never-smokers, the correlations between zFEV1 and zFEVFVC (0.35 in Biobank, 0.36 in the national surveys) and between zFVC and zFEVFVC (−0.13 in Biobank, −0.20 in the national surveys) were weak enough to avoid major collinearity in the joint models. The significance of the HR for zFEVFVC when modelled jointly with zFEV1 was used to assess whether zFVC predicted mortality independent of zFEV1, and vice versa when zFEVFVC was modelled jointly with zFEV1.  All proportional hazards models were restricted to white participants and adjusted for sex, age, standing height, socioeconomic status and region. Analyses of data from the five national health surveys were additionally adjusted for survey year as a categorical variable. Since each survey was conducted in a different year, inclusion of survey year in the model is closely equivalent to a fixed-effect meta-analysis of the results from each of the five surveys. In a more formal two-stage individual participant meta-analysis for all-cause mortality in lifelong non-smokers, there was no substantial or significant heterogeneity of HRs among the five national health surveys (I²=0.0%, p=0.775 for zFEV1; I²=10.5%, p=0.346 for zFVC). Therefore, for simplicity of presentation we report results for the five national surveys combined, but analyse UKB separately because one of our objectives is to investigate how closely these two sets of results correspond. Heterogeneity between HRs for the pooled national surveys and UKB was assessed by testing the significance of the difference between the corresponding log-HRs from these two data sets.  The assumption of proportionality of hazards was assessed by log-log plots and by fitting zFEV1 or zFVC as a time-dependent covariate in the model. No strong or statistically significant evidence of time dependence emerged for all-cause mortality among lifelong non-smokers. Nevertheless, results for all-cause mortality were partitioned at 5 years of follow-up for two reasons. First, because the minimum duration of follow-up in UKB was 4.87 years, so virtually all of that cohort had been followed for 5 years or more, allowing a more direct comparison with results from the national health surveys, all of which had been followed for more than 5 years. The second reason for partitioning at 5 years was to address the possibility of reverse causation (impaired spirometric performance due to pre-existing conditions which lead to early death).

This was considered the most inclusive sample of ‘usable spirograms’. When end-blow quality was also considered, 58% of the cohort had evidence of a good plateau and both FEV1 and FVC reproducible within 150 mL, the criteria recommended by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) Task Force on Standardisation of Spirometry.17 This subgroup of 58% was considered to be the ‘best quality’ spirograms, among which to evaluate the relative importance of FEV1 and FVC as predictors of mortality.  The present analysis is based on deaths occurring up to mid-August 2015, a mean follow-up period of 6.5 years. There were 2401 deaths among 149 343 lifelong non-smokers aged 40–69 years of white ethnicity who performed ‘usable spirograms. Deaths from respiratory disease, circulatory disease, cancer and all other causes were coded using ICD10 (chapters J, I, C and all others, respectively).  Smoking history was self reported. Socioeconomic status was measured at the level of residential area, using the Townsend Deprivation Index, grouped into quartiles for analysis. Biobank recruitment centre was used as an additional covariate to adjust for possible regional differences.  Adjustment of spirometric measures for gender, age and height The Global Lung Initiative (GLI) 2012 reference equations for white ethnic groups18 were used in both sets of data to standardise FEV1 and FVC for age, sex and height. The GLI-2012 equations generate a ‘z-score’ which represents the relative position of an individual among the distribution predicted for lifelong non-smokers with no history of lung disease of the same gender, age and height. This allows for the spread of predicted values to differ by age, height and gender, expressing the relative ranking of an individual in terms of a SD (z) score. For each individual in the analysis, there were three GLI-2012 z-scores, corresponding to their relative ranking for FEV1 (zFEV1), FVC (zFVC) and the ratio FEV1:FVC (zFEVFVC).

Anthropometric indexes (height, weight, waist and hip circumference, body composition) and other physiologic characteristics (heel bone mineral density, grip strength, blood pressure, pulse rate) were measured following standardized protocols. We estimated the age-adjusted means of each characteristic in 6 diet groups (198,166 regular meat eaters, 199,784 low meat eaters, 4381 poultry eaters, 9674 fish eaters, 6366 vegetarians, and 378 vegans) in white women and men, and in 2 diet groups (3322 meat eaters and 1186 vegetarians) in British Indian women and men.""",Yes,"No test statistics ""Results In white women, after adjustment for age and compared with regular meat eaters, non–red meat eaters had lower adiposity (e.g., 4.5% lower body fat in vegan women) and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure (−4.2 and −3.3 mm Hg, respectively), and generally lower heel bone mineral density t-score (−0.26).

At the physical measures station, participants were asked to remove their socks and shoes. Height was measured with the use of the Seca 202 height measure (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Waist (at the natural indent) and hip (widest point) circumferences were measured over light clothes with the use of the Seca-200 tape measure (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Weight and bioimpedance were measured by using the Tanita BC418ma bioimpedance device (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan), from which percentages of body fat and lean mass were estimated. BMI was calculated as weight (kilograms)/height (meters) squared. Calcaneal bone density was taken on the left heel with the use of a Norland McCue Contact Ultrasound Bone Analyzer (Norland, Trumbull, Connecticut, USA), with participants sitting upright; and a heel BMD t-score was calculated on the basis of the measured BMD values. Hand-grip strength for each hand was taken by using the Jamar Hydraulic hand dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, Indiana, USA), and we considered both the higher grip-strength value of either hand and average grip strength of the 2 hands for our analyses. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse rate were taken with the use of the Omron HEM-7015IT digital blood pressure monitor (Omron, Kyoto, Japan) after participants have been seated for ≥5 min, and the averages of 2 measurements, taken ≥1 min apart, were used for analyses.""",Yes,"""Ethnicity classification On the touch-screen questionnaire, participants were asked to select their ethnicity from options of “White,” “Mixed,” “Asian or Asian British,” “Black or Black British,” “Chinese,” “Other ethnic group,” “Do not know,” or “Prefer not to answer.” Participants were included for analyses if they identified as “white” or as “Asian or Asian British” and subsequently as “Indian.” The white population was included because it made up the majority of the UK Biobank population (∼94%), and the British Indian population was included due to the large proportion of vegetarians in this population group (24.6% compared with 1.7% in the overall cohort)....Diet group classification For classification of diet groups, relevant dietary information from the touch-screen questionnaire was used. Participants were asked their frequency of consumption of processed meat, beef, lamb or mutton, pork, chicken, turkey or other poultry, oily fish, or other types of fish, in 6 categories of frequency ranging from “Never” to “Once or more daily.” Participants were also asked whether they never ate eggs or foods containing eggs or dairy products.  On the basis of these questions, 6 diet groups (regular meat eaters, low meat eaters, poultry eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans) were defined for the white population. To rank the participants by weekly red and processed-meat consumption based on the touch-screen, we summed the frequencies for processed meat, beef, pork, and lamb or mutton by using the following coding: “Never” = 0, “Less than once a week” = 0.5, “Once a week” = 1, “2–4 times a week” = 3, “5–6 times a week” = 5.5, and “Once or more daily” = 7. Regular meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating red (beef, lamb or mutton, or pork) or processed meat >3 times/wk, whereas low meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating red or processed meat ≤3 times/wk, regardless of what else they ate. Poultry eaters were defined as participants who reported never consuming any red or processed meat but who did eat poultry. Fish eaters were participants who reported that they never consumed any red meat, processed meat, or poultry but who ate oily or nonoily fish. Vegetarians were defined as participants who reported that they never consumed any meat or fish, and vegans were participants who reported that they never consumed any meat, fish, eggs or foods containing eggs, or dairy products. A total of 2630 white participants who did not answer the relevant questions to be classified into a diet group were excluded from our analyses. For the British Indian population, 2 diet groups (meat eaters and vegetarians) were defined due to the smaller numbers in this population group.

For this study, we excluded participants who reported that they had changed their diet in the past 5 y due to illness or who did not answer this question (n = 57,907). All of the participants also attended a computer-assisted personal interview and had physical measurements taken. In addition to the touch-screen questionnaire, additional dietary information was collected with the use of a Web-based 24-h dietary assessment tool (14), which was administered ≤5 times in a large subsample of participants (∼210,000). A participant flow chart of this study is included as Supplemental Figure 1. This observational study was registered at http://www.isrctn.com/ as ISRCTN10125697.  Ethnicity classification On the touch-screen questionnaire, participants were asked to select their ethnicity from options of “White,” “Mixed,” “Asian or Asian British,” “Black or Black British,” “Chinese,” “Other ethnic group,” “Do not know,” or “Prefer not to answer.” Participants were included for analyses if they identified as “white” or as “Asian or Asian British” and subsequently as “Indian.” The white population was included because it made up the majority of the UK Biobank population (∼94%), and the British Indian population was included due to the large proportion of vegetarians in this population group (24.6% compared with 1.7% in the overall cohort).  Diet group classification For classification of diet groups, relevant dietary information from the touch-screen questionnaire was used. Participants were asked their frequency of consumption of processed meat, beef, lamb or mutton, pork, chicken, turkey or other poultry, oily fish, or other types of fish, in 6 categories of frequency ranging from “Never” to “Once or more daily.” Participants were also asked whether they never ate eggs or foods containing eggs or dairy products.  On the basis of these questions, 6 diet groups (regular meat eaters, low meat eaters, poultry eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans) were defined for the white population. To rank the participants by weekly red and processed-meat consumption based on the touch-screen, we summed the frequencies for processed meat, beef, pork, and lamb or mutton by using the following coding: “Never” = 0, “Less than once a week” = 0.5, “Once a week” = 1, “2–4 times a week” = 3, “5–6 times a week” = 5.5, and “Once or more daily” = 7. Regular meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating red (beef, lamb or mutton, or pork) or processed meat >3 times/wk, whereas low meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating red or processed meat ≤3 times/wk, regardless of what else they ate. Poultry eaters were defined as participants who reported never consuming any red or processed meat but who did eat poultry. Fish eaters were participants who reported that they never consumed any red meat, processed meat, or poultry but who ate oily or nonoily fish. Vegetarians were defined as participants who reported that they never consumed any meat or fish, and vegans were participants who reported that they never consumed any meat, fish, eggs or foods containing eggs, or dairy products. A total of 2630 white participants who did not answer the relevant questions to be classified into a diet group were excluded from our analyses. For the British Indian population, 2 diet groups (meat eaters and vegetarians) were defined due to the smaller numbers in this population group. Meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating any red meat, processed meat, or poultry; and vegetarians were defined as participants who reported that they did not eat any meat or fish but did eat eggs, dairy products, or both. A total of 278 British Indian participants were excluded because they did not answer the relevant questions, or because they were fish eaters or vegans. Separately, information collected with the use of the Web-based 24-h dietary assessment tool was used to estimate food and nutrient intakes in each diet group.  Anthropometric and physiologic measures Anthropometric and physiologic measures were collected on all participants during the baseline visit by trained staff following a standardized protocol. At the physical measures station, participants were asked to remove their socks and shoes. Height was measured with the use of the Seca 202 height measure (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Waist (at the natural indent) and hip (widest point) circumferences were measured over light clothes with the use of the Seca-200 tape measure (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Weight and bioimpedance were measured by using the Tanita BC418ma bioimpedance device (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan), from which percentages of body fat and lean mass were estimated. BMI was calculated as weight (kilograms)/height (meters) squared. Calcaneal bone density was taken on the left heel with the use of a Norland McCue Contact Ultrasound Bone Analyzer (Norland, Trumbull, Connecticut, USA), with participants sitting upright; and a heel BMD t-score was calculated on the basis of the measured BMD values. Hand-grip strength for each hand was taken by using the Jamar Hydraulic hand dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, Indiana, USA), and we considered both the higher grip-strength value of either hand and average grip strength of the 2 hands for our analyses. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse rate were taken with the use of the Omron HEM-7015IT digital blood pressure monitor (Omron, Kyoto, Japan) after participants have been seated for ≥5 min, and the averages of 2 measurements, taken ≥1 min apart, were used for analyses.  Statistical analyses Summary baseline characteristics of the cohort were tabulated by 6 diet groups in white women and men and by 2 diet groups in British Indian women and men.

Models developed to identify patients at risk for EAC and increase early detection have been developed based on data from case–control studies. We analyzed data from a prospective study to identify factors available to clinicians that identify individuals with a high absolute risk of EAC.  Methods We collected data from 355,034 individuals (all older than 50 years) without a prior history of cancer enrolled in the UK Biobank prospective cohort study from 2006 through 2010; clinical data were collected through September 2014. We identified demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors, measured at baseline, that associated with development of EAC within 5 years using logistic regression analysis. We used these data to create a model to identify individuals at risk for EAC. Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity analyses.""",Yes,"""Results Within up to 5 years of follow up, 220 individuals developed EAC. Age, sex, smoking, body mass index, and history of esophageal conditions or treatments identified individuals who developed EAC (AUROC, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.77–0.82). We used these factors to develop a scoring system and identified a point cut off that 104,723 individuals (29.5%), including 170 of the 220 cases with EAC, were above. The scoring system identified individuals who developed EAC with 77.4% sensitivity and 70.5% specificity. The 5-year risk of EAC was 0.16% for individuals with scores above the threshold and 0.02% for individuals with scores below the threshold.  Conclusion We combined data on several well-established risk factors that are available to clinicians to develop a system to identify individuals with a higher absolute risk of EAC within 5 years. Studies are needed to evaluate the utility of these factors in a multi-stage, triaged, screening program.""",Yes,"""The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is increasing in Western populations,1 and prognosis is poor. Overall survival is <20%.2 Methods to improve early diagnosis are important3 because the poor survival is largely attributable to late clinical presentation with advanced disease.2  Endoscopy with biopsies for histologic confirmation is the gold standard method of detecting esophageal and gastric cancers.4, 5 However, population-wide endoscopy screening programs are unlikely to be cost-effective or feasible because of the low incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancers and the cost, invasiveness, and psychological burden of endoscopy screening.6  Clinical guidelines suggest that individuals with chronic symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) should be referred for endoscopy screening to identify Barrett’s esophagus,7 a precursor to EAC present in 1%–2% of the adult population.8 Individuals with Barrett’s esophagus are often entered into endoscopy surveillance programs.9 Use of GERD as the sole initial triage factor for endoscopy is appealing in its simplicity, but delays in obtaining endoscopy are common in part because of a lack of both specificity, because risk of EAC in individuals with GERD is low,10, 11 and sensitivity, because a large proportion of EAC cases (∼40%) never report GERD symptoms.11  Automated clinical risk prediction tools using data easily accessible to primary care physicians to flag high-risk individuals may offer a lower cost method to improve early detection and are being investigated for other conditions.12 Established risk factors including body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and GERD may be useful for risk prediction of EAC13, 14, 15 and Barrett’s esophagus.16, 17, 18 However, existing studies have relied on age and sex matched case-control data, which may be subject to recall bias and ignore age and sex in improving the risk prediction, which are strong risk factors.19 An assessment of traditional risk factors may be useful as triage directly to endoscopy, in which case risk prediction for any upper gastrointestinal cancers diagnosed via endoscopy would be most informative.

Residential greenness, a fundamental component of urban design, has been shown to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders. The present study investigates the association between residential green exposure and prevalence of major depressive disorders using a large and diverse cross-sectional dataset from the UK Biobank.  Methods In this cross-sectional, observational, associational study, we used baseline data from the UK Biobank cohort of participants aged 37–73 years from across the UK. Environmental exposure data were derived from a modelled and linked built environment database. Residential greenness was assessed with a 0·5 m resolution Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, which is derived from spectral reflectance measurements in remotely sensed colour infrared data and measured within geocoded dwelling catchments. Other environment metrics included street-level movement density, terrain, and fine particulate exposures. A series of logistic models examined associations between residential greenness and odds of major depressive disorder after adjusting for activity-influencing environments and individual covariates.""",Yes,"""Findings Of 122 993 participants with data on major depressive disorder, the study analytical sample comprised 94 879 (77·1%) participants recruited across ten UK Biobank assessment centres between April 29, 2009, and Oct 1, 2010. A protective effect of greenness on depression was consistently observed, with 4·0% lower odds of major depressive disorder per interquartile increment in Normalised Difference Vegetation Index greenness (odds ratio 0·960, 95% CI 0·93–0·99; p=0·0044). Interaction analyses indicated that the beneficial effects of greenness were more pronounced among women, participants younger than 60 years, and participants residing in areas with low neighbourhood socioeconomic status or high urbanicity.  Interpretation The results point to the benefits of well designed green environments on mental health. Further longitudinal studies are needed to decipher causal pathways. In the UK, policies aimed at optimising allocation and design of green spaces might help preserve psychological ecosystem services, thereby, improving the mental wellbeing of populations and enhancing the mental capital of cities.""",Yes,"""Introduction Given the present unprecedented rate of urbanisation, about 60% of the global population are predicted to reside in cities by 2030, with one in every three people living in cities with at least half a million inhabitants.1 Typically, cities are characterised by highly dense, impervious, built-up spaces and a scarcity of natural environments, with the associated potential effects on mental health. Dynamic stress vulnerability models have reported links between reduced exposure to green environments and enhanced vulnerability to the negative health effects of stressful life events, which can result in increments in the proportion of the population with mental disorders and an overall reduction in the mental capital of cities.2, 3, 4 In recent years, mental disorders, including mood disorders, have emerged as a leading cause of global disease burden. They also act as risk factors for the development of communicable and non-communicable diseases, and contribute to accidental and non-accidental injuries.5, 6, 7 The UK's total annual expenditure on brain disorders was estimated to be approximately €134 billion in 2010, of which €19·24 billion was incurred on mood disorders, accounting for approximately 3·9 million annual cases or 8·73% of all brain disorders.8  The causes of mental health disorders are complex, with a long latency between exposures and subsequent incidence and progression. A systems-based life course approach towards enhancing the mental capital of cities and wellbeing of their populations has been proposed.9 The importance of such a holistic approach has been emphasised by the inclusion of mental health within the Sustainable Development Goals.10, 11 Relatedly, exposure to residential green environment has also been regarded as an effective upstream-level urban intervention with an aim to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders.12  Research in context  Evidence before this study  We searched online databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO, Scopus, and Google/Google Scholar databases, for studies and reports published in English between Jan 1, 1984, and Feb 10, 2018, using a combination of search terms, including “residential greenness”, “green space”, “NDVI”, or “built environment”, and “mental health”, “depression”, or “major depressive disorder”.  Mental health disorders have emerged as a leading cause of the global burden of disease. At the same time, the present unprecedented pace of urbanisation and an increasing proportion of impervious built-up spaces in our cities have resulted in reduced exposures to salutogenic green environments. Several studies have examined the links between exposure to green environments and mental health, with most studies suggesting beneficial effects. Green exposure has been measured in terms of access to green spaces (proportion of green spaces within a residential neighbourhood) as well as the general salutogenic potential of green environments. The protective effects of residential green have been hypothesised to originate from one or more of its functional roles: as restorative stress-relieving spaces; supportive social interaction spaces promoting a sense of community; active living spaces facilitating physical activity; and natural filters ameliorating the adverse effects of negative exposures such as air, noise, and thermal pollution.  Notwithstanding the evidence generated so far, the links between residential green exposure and mental health still remain equivocal in adults. Many of the studies linking residential green exposure with mental health have used coarse measures of green exposure, whereas a few studies have used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index as an index of salutogenic green, although of low-to-moderate spatial resolution. Most studies so far have been small scale and done in homogeneous environmental settings, resulting in limited statistical power and generalisability....Some studies report a beneficial effect of contact with green environments on health, in general,13, 14, 15 and more specifically, with regard to stress, mood, and mental health.16, 17 Several studies have established a protective independent association between various indicators of mental health and the percentage of green space within a residential neighbourhood,18, 19, 20, 21 the amount of tree cover in an urban area,22 and the overall exposure of individuals to salutogenic green environments.23, 24, 25 These protective effects of residential green spaces have been explained in terms of four mechanisms related to their specific functional roles: restorative, stress-relieving spaces;4, 26, 27, 28 supportive, social interaction spaces that promote a sense of community;29 active living spaces that facilitate physical activity;30, 31, 32 and natural filters that ameliorate the adverse effects of air, noise, and thermal pollution.33, 34, 35  Despite the substantial body of evidence, the links between residential green exposure and mental health still remain far from conclusive in adults.17 Many of the studies have used coarse measures of green exposure, expressed as a proportion of greenness based on land cover maps within a specific catchment or census geography, thereby neglecting to include private gardens, street trees, and green spaces that do not meet a specific criterion, such as a size threshold, and hindering the study's replicability and comparability. A few studies have used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an index of greenery derived from Landsat satellite data, as an overall measure of green exposure (although at a low-to-moderate resolution).

UKBUMP is a high-resolution spatial database of health-influencing environment exposures modelled within multiscale residential neighbourhoods of each UK Biobank participant's geocoded dwelling. Environmental exposure metrics were developed through spatial and network analyses of data from multiple UK-wide spatial databases, resulting in multiple exposure variables related to greenness, urban density, destination accessibility, street-level accessibility, terrain, and deprivation.43, 44 Briefly, UKBUMP was developed by geocoding participants' dwelling addresses to the level of building footprints, delineating multiscale dwelling neighbourhoods by defining street network buffers centred on the geocoded dwelling locations in ArcGIS12 Network Analyst, and measuring environmental exposures within these functional neighbourhoods. After linking the exposure metrics to the participants' dwelling locations, the data were reanonymised. Accurate data on building-level land uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated Transport Network databases, whereas residential greenness was modelled from high-resolution (50 × 50 cm2) colour infrared data captured during aerial photography with the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4.43  Residential greenness Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank participants' dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote sensing device. Chlorophyll in healthy vegetation absorbs radiation in the visible red region (630–690 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflects radiation in the near-infrared region (760–900 nm). This differential in the absorbance and reflectance of wavelengths by chlorophyll is used as a proxy for green quality and intensity. The differential is measured using the following formula:   The formula includes the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the visible (RED) and near-infrared regions (NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Index scores range between −1 and 1, with higher values indicating higher densities of green vegetation.  In the present study, NDVI greenness was derived from a series of 0·5 m resolution, colour-infrared imagery collected by Bluesky (Ashby-De-La-Zouch, UK) with the help of specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Summer-time images of the study areas collected over similar temporal scales (across the baseline phase of the UK Biobank study) were stitched together to avoid temporal mismatch.

UKBUMP is a high-resolution spatial database of health-influencing environment exposures modelled within multiscale residential neighbourhoods of each UK Biobank participant's geocoded dwelling. Environmental exposure metrics were developed through spatial and network analyses of data from multiple UK-wide spatial databases, resulting in multiple exposure variables related to greenness, urban density, destination accessibility, street-level accessibility, terrain, and deprivation.43, 44 Briefly, UKBUMP was developed by geocoding participants' dwelling addresses to the level of building footprints, delineating multiscale dwelling neighbourhoods by defining street network buffers centred on the geocoded dwelling locations in ArcGIS12 Network Analyst, and measuring environmental exposures within these functional neighbourhoods. After linking the exposure metrics to the participants' dwelling locations, the data were reanonymised. Accurate data on building-level land uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated Transport Network databases, whereas residential greenness was modelled from high-resolution (50 × 50 cm2) colour infrared data captured during aerial photography with the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4.43  Residential greenness Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank participants' dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote sensing device. Chlorophyll in healthy vegetation absorbs radiation in the visible red region (630–690 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflects radiation in the near-infrared region (760–900 nm). This differential in the absorbance and reflectance of wavelengths by chlorophyll is used as a proxy for green quality and intensity. The differential is measured using the following formula:   The formula includes the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the visible (RED) and near-infrared regions (NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Index scores range between −1 and 1, with higher values indicating higher densities of green vegetation.  In the present study, NDVI greenness was derived from a series of 0·5 m resolution, colour-infrared imagery collected by Bluesky (Ashby-De-La-Zouch, UK) with the help of specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Summer-time images of the study areas collected over similar temporal scales (across the baseline phase of the UK Biobank study) were stitched together to avoid temporal mismatch. After excluding large water bodies, we modelled mean NDVI within a 500 m residential buffer of each UK Biobank participant. Selection of a 500 m catchment area for measuring residential green exposures was based on our previous studies46, 47 and on other previous reports48, 49 that used a quarter mile (400–500 m) neighbourhood for measuring NDVI greenness.  Physical environment Among the physical environment exposures, terrain was modelled in ArcGIS12 Spatial Analyst from a 5 m resolution Bluesky digital terrain model and expressed as variability (SD) of slope, in degrees, within a 0·5 km residential catchment of UK Biobank participants' dwellings. As such, the metric is able to differentiate between flat and hilly surface within the residential catchment.  Exposure to PM2·5 obtained from UK Biobank's linked air pollution exposure data was used as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution. The measurement was based on monitoring on three occasions over a 14 day period during the cold, warm, and intermediate seasons of the year. Individual annual exposure to particulate matter concentrations around geocoded residential addresses was derived from land-use regression models.50  Built environment Built-environment metrics from UKBUMP were assessed within a 1 km street catchment of participants' dwellings. Street-level movement density was modelled in terms of through-movement potential of the street segments, also termed as betweenness centrality in graph theoretic terminology. The method has been used in active living research and described elsewhere.51, 52 The UK-wide street network data for the study area comprised approximately 4 million street segments, which were extracted from the OS MasterMap Integrated Transport Network database, transcribed into an access graph model, and subjected to network analysis in sDNA53 to model street-level movement density. Movement density is expressed as the simulated counts of movement through each link in the network, given its relative position and topological connectivity with other segments within the network. The measure also acts as a proxy for relative accessibility and centrality of a place. Betweenness centrality of x in a graph of N links might be defined as:  ɛ ɛ  In the formula, y and z are the geodesic endpoints; Ry is the set of links within a defined neighbourhood catchment from y; L(y) is the length of link y and L(z) is the length of link z; and P(z) is the proportion of link z within the defined radius.  The origin-destination function (OD) is defined as:   An objective index of urbanicity within a 1 km residential catchment was developed from the UKBUMP built-environment variables to investigate associations between residential greenness and major depressive disorder, stratified by urbanicity quartiles. Urbanicity was defined as:   The formula includes the density of residential housing (resid), retail (retail), and public transport (PT) in units per km2 street catchment, in addition to street-level movement density (street movement).  Individual-level covariates On the basis of previous scientific literature, the study adjusted for demographic covariates (age, sex, highest educational qualification, and employment status), smoking status, and prevalent comorbidities (body-mass index [BMI] status, doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease, and diabetes).  Socioeconomic status was assessed at household and neighbourhood levels in terms of mean annual household income before tax and Townsend deprivation index scores,54 which is a composite index of four postcode-level socioeconomic status variables (household overcrowding, unemployment, non-home ownership, and non-car ownership), with a higher score indicative of lower neighbourhood socioeconomic status.  We used participation in leisure and social activities as a proxy for social interaction and support. Level of participation was based on response to the questionnaire: “Which of the following do you attend once a week or more often? (You can select more than one)”; with available responses being none; pub or social club; religious group; sports club or gym; and adult education class or other group activity. Responses were converted into a six-factor variable: none, pub or social club, religious group, sports club or gym, adult education class and other, and combination of two or more activities.  Statistical analyses The prevalence of lifetime experience of probable major depressive disorder was modelled as a two factor variable (case or non-case) as per UK Biobank's assessment protocol. Age was coded as a three-factor variable (38–50 years, 51–60 years, or 61–73 years) and sex as a two-factor variable (female or male). Highest educational attainment was defined as a five-factor variable (none; O levels, GCSEs, or CSEs; A levels or AS levels; NVQ, HND, HNC, or other professional qualification; or college or university degree) and employment as a three-factor variable (employed; retired; or unemployed, home maker, or other). Mean annual household income before tax was expressed as a four-factor variable (<£18 000, £18 000–£30 999, £31 000–£51 999, or ≥£52 000).

Betweenness centrality of x in a graph of N links might be defined as:  ɛ ɛ  In the formula, y and z are the geodesic endpoints; Ry is the set of links within a defined neighbourhood catchment from y; L(y) is the length of link y and L(z) is the length of link z; and P(z) is the proportion of link z within the defined radius.  The origin-destination function (OD) is defined as:   An objective index of urbanicity within a 1 km residential catchment was developed from the UKBUMP built-environment variables to investigate associations between residential greenness and major depressive disorder, stratified by urbanicity quartiles. Urbanicity was defined as:   The formula includes the density of residential housing (resid), retail (retail), and public transport (PT) in units per km2 street catchment, in addition to street-level movement density (street movement).  Individual-level covariates On the basis of previous scientific literature, the study adjusted for demographic covariates (age, sex, highest educational qualification, and employment status), smoking status, and prevalent comorbidities (body-mass index [BMI] status, doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease, and diabetes).  Socioeconomic status was assessed at household and neighbourhood levels in terms of mean annual household income before tax and Townsend deprivation index scores,54 which is a composite index of four postcode-level socioeconomic status variables (household overcrowding, unemployment, non-home ownership, and non-car ownership), with a higher score indicative of lower neighbourhood socioeconomic status.  We used participation in leisure and social activities as a proxy for social interaction and support. Level of participation was based on response to the questionnaire: “Which of the following do you attend once a week or more often? (You can select more than one)”; with available responses being none; pub or social club; religious group; sports club or gym; and adult education class or other group activity. Responses were converted into a six-factor variable: none, pub or social club, religious group, sports club or gym, adult education class and other, and combination of two or more activities.  Statistical analyses The prevalence of lifetime experience of probable major depressive disorder was modelled as a two factor variable (case or non-case) as per UK Biobank's assessment protocol. Age was coded as a three-factor variable (38–50 years, 51–60 years, or 61–73 years) and sex as a two-factor variable (female or male). Highest educational attainment was defined as a five-factor variable (none; O levels, GCSEs, or CSEs; A levels or AS levels; NVQ, HND, HNC, or other professional qualification; or college or university degree) and employment as a three-factor variable (employed; retired; or unemployed, home maker, or other). Mean annual household income before tax was expressed as a four-factor variable (<£18 000, £18 000–£30 999, £31 000–£51 999, or ≥£52 000). The household income data were available for 82 839 participants in the analytical sample. Townsend scores were categorised into quintiles and used as a five-factor variable. Smoking status was coded as non-smoker, previous smoker, and current smoker. Doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease was transformed into a four-factor variable (none; high blood pressure; heart attack, angina, or stroke; or both high blood pressure and heart attack, angina, or stroke) and diabetes was coded as a two-factor variables (yes or no). Measured BMI status was expressed as a three-factor variable (<25 kg/m2; ≥25 kg/m2 and <30 kg/m2; or ≥30 kg/m2). Terrain variability and walkability (expressed as movement density) were transformed into quartiles.  The study followed a multi-layered analyses strategy.

However, no one has examined whether chronotype is associated with mortality risk to date. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that being an evening type is associated with increased mortality in a large cohort study, the UK Biobank. Our analysis included 433 268 adults aged 38–73 at the time of enrolment and an average 6.5-year follow-up. The primary exposure was chronotype, as assessed through a single self-reported question-defining participants as definite morning types, moderate morning types, moderate evening types or definite evening types. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and mortality due to CVD. Prevalent disease was also compared among the chronotype groups. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, body mass index, sleep duration, socioeconomic status and comorbidities.""",Yes,"""Greater eveningness, particularly being a definite evening type, was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of all comorbidities. Comparing definite evening type to definite morning type, the associations were strongest for psychological disorders (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.86–2.02, p = < 0.001), followed by diabetes (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.24–1.36, p = < 0.001), neurological disorders (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.20–1.30, p = < 0.001), gastrointestinal/abdominal disorders (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.19–1.27, p = < 0.001) and respiratory disorders (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.18–1.26, p = < 0.001). The total number of deaths was 10 534, out of which 2127 were due to CVD. Greater eveningness, based on chronotype as an ordinal variable, was associated with a small increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.004–1.05, p = 0.017) and CVD mortality (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00–1.09, p = 0.06). Compared to definite morning types, definite evening types had significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02–1.18, p = 0.012). This first report of increased mortality in evening types is consistent with previous reports of increased levels of cardiometabolic risk factors in this group. Mortality risk in evening types may be due to behavioural, psychological and physiological risk factors, many of which may be attributable to chronic misalignment between internal physiological timing and externally imposed timing of work and social activities. These findings suggest the need for researching possible interventions aimed at either modifying circadian rhythms in individuals or at allowing evening types greater working hour flexibility.""",No,"""Introduction Identifying novel,potentially modifiable, life-style factors associated with increased morbidity and mortality can lead to innovative strategies for improving health. We investigated a measure of chronotype, which is an estimate of the general part of the day (ranging between morning and evening) that a person prefers for their daily activities. Later chronotype (i.e. evening preference) and later timing of sleep (which is associated with later chronotype) have been associated with morbidity, including higher rates of metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Reutrakul and Knutson 2015; Merikanto et al. 2013; Yu et al. 2015; Koopman et al. 2017) and psychiatric symptoms (Jankowski 2016; Melo et al. 2017; Putilov 2017). In the UK Biobank Study, a large prospective cohort study, a preference for evening was also associated with more cardiovascular risk factors, such as higher rates of smoking and overweight/obesity (Patterson et al. 2017).  Current evidence therefore implicates later chronotype (i.e. being a self-described “evening person”) in the risk of a variety of diseases. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that a later chronotype is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality as well as mortality due to CVD in a large study of adults in the United Kingdom.""",No,,Yes,"""The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that a later chronotype is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality as well as mortality due to CVD in a large study of adults in the United Kingdom.""",Yes,Methods on page 2,Yes,"""We used data from the UK Biobank, a large, prospective, population-based cohort study that was designed to investigate risk factors for major disease of middle and older age (Sudlow et al. 2015).

Which ONE of these types do you consider yourself to be?” and had the response options “Definitely a ‘morning’ type, Rather more a ‘morning’ than an ‘evening’ type, Rather more an ‘evening’ type than a ‘morning’ type, Definitely an ‘evening’ type”.  Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality and mortality due to CVD. Mortality information was obtained from the National Health Service for England and Wales and by the NHS Central Register in Scotland. All details from the death certificate were provided to UK Biobank. Primary cause of death was codified according to ICD10 by trained UK Biobank personnel. We identified the ICD10 codes I00-I99 as CVD-related.  Comorbidities were based on self-report. Specifically, participants were asked to report any illnesses they had and if the participant was uncertain of the type of illness he/she had, they described it to the interviewer (a trained nurse) who attempted to code it. If the illness could not be coded during the interview, the interviewer entered a free-text description, which was subsequently reviewed by a physician and, where possible, matched to codes. Using these codes, cases of self-reported CVD, diabetes, other endocrine disorders, neurological disorders, renal disorders, respiratory disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, gastrointestinal/abdominal disorders and psychological disorders were identified (see Supplemental Table 1).  Covariates in the model were selected based on the potential to confound associations between chronotype and mortality. These covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status (SES), sleep duration and comorbidities. Age at baseline assessment was calculated in years based on date of birth. Three age bins were defined based on previous analyses of UK Biobank data (Ganna and Ingelsson 2015): 37–52, 53–62 and 63–73 years. Sex (male/female) and ethnicity were self-identified. Since a large majority of the sample (94%) self-identified as “white”, we dichotomised ethnicity into “white” and “non-white”. Smoking status was obtained by self-report with the following categories: “never”, “previous smoker”, “current smoker” and “prefer not to answer”. Standing height was measured using a Seca 240-cm height measure while participants stood barefoot with posture verified by trained staff. Weight was measured using a Tanita BC418MA body composition analyser and BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m²). SES was based on the Townsend deprivation index (Townsend et al. 1988), which was calculated immediately prior to participants joining UK Biobank and was based on the preceding national census output areas. Each participant was assigned a score based on their postcode.  Finally, sleep duration came from the touch screen interview based on the question, “About how many hours sleep do you get in every 24 hours (please include naps)?” and responses were provided as integers.  Statistical analyses Analyses were restricted to those participants who provided a response to the question about chronotype (n = 444 281) and further excluded those who were missing any of the covariate data resulting in a final sample size of 433 268 participants. The chronotype groups were compared in unadjusted analyses using analyses of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables (e.g. age, BMI, sleep duration, SES) or chi-squared tests for categorical variables (e.g. sex, ethnicity, smoking, comorbidities). Mean chronotype score was also compared between groups using t tests (for dichotomous variables) or ANOVA (for variables with >2 groups). The prevalence of the comorbidities between the chronotype groups was also compared after adjusting for age and sex using logistic regression models. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk of mortality according to chronotype. We modelled chronotype as an ordinal variable and, to allow for non-linear associations, we also created dummy variables with definite morning type as the referent. Cox proportional hazards models were estimated adjusting for age (as continuous variable), sex, ethnicity, smoking status, BMI, SES, diagnosed comorbidities and sleep duration. We also created interaction terms between chronotype (ordinal variable) and both sex and the three age groups to test for differences in associations between mortality and chronotype. When interaction terms were significant, we conducted stratified analyses. Finally, a significant number of participants (n = 50 061) selected the answer “do not know” to the chronotype question. Other investigators reporting UK Biobank data (Jones et al. 2016) have chosen to classify this group as a fifth, intermediate response. So, to verify our findings, we have repeated the analysis of chronotype and mortality risk using a five-level chronotype variable: 2 definite morning type, 1 moderate morning types, 0 do not know, −1 moderate evening types and −2 definite evening types.

However, key environmental determinants of chronotype are potentially modifiable by interventions aimed at advancing circadian phase, such as administration of light in the morning and of melatonin in the evening. Another strategy to improve health of evening types would be to adjust work schedules to suit individual chronotype. It is also worth noting that daylight savings time (DST)/summer time places a further burden on individuals who are already struggling with the dictates of social norms on when to start the working day, and the switch to DST, which is perceived as more uncomfortable by evening types than by morning types (Nascimento De Alencar et al. 2017; Kantermann et al. 2007), also coincided with greater incidence of cardiovascular events (Jiddou et al. 2013).

Methods We used prospective follow-up data from the UK Biobank cohort study to assess self-reported isolation (a three-item scale) and loneliness (two questions). The main outcomes were all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We calculated the percentage of excess risk mediated by risk factors to assess the extent to which the associations of social isolation and loneliness with mortality were attributable to differences between isolated and lonely individuals and others in biological (body-mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and handgrip strength), behavioural (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity), socioeconomic (education, neighbourhood deprivation, and household income), and psychological (depressive symptoms and cognitive capacity) risk factors.""",Yes,"""Findings 466 901 men and women (mean age at baseline 56·5 years [SD 8·1]) were included in the analyses, with a mean follow-up of 6·5 years (SD 0·8).

The Townsend deprivation index is an integrated neighbourhood-level measure of unemployment, non-car ownership, non-home ownership, and household overcrowding across the UK.15 To assess biological factors, trained data collectors measured height and weight in all participants during clinic attendance using standard operating procedures, and the body-mass index (BMI) was subsequently calculated.

Depressive symptoms were measured using the frequency of four items from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ):16,  17 (1) depressed mood, (2) disinterest or absence of enthusiasm, (3) tenseness or restlessness, and (4) tiredness or lethargy in the previous 2 weeks.

Similar scales have been used previously in other UK studies.12 Loneliness was assessed with two questions: “Do you often feel lonely?” (no=0, yes=1) and “How often are you able to confide in someone close to you?” (0=almost daily to about once a month; 1=once every few months to never or almost never). An individual was defined as lonely if he or she scored 2, and not lonely if he or she scored 0 or 1.

We examined the associations of social isolation and loneliness with all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazard models with age as a timescale. Associations with cause-specific mortality were examined using competing-risks survival regression (based on Fine and Gray's proportional sub-hazards model), which is the appropriate method for estimation of competing actual risks.19 All the models were adjusted for age, sex, and ethnic origin, with additional adjustment for chronic disease. To measure the robustness of these associations, we did additional subgroup analyses separately for men and women, three age groups (37–52 years, 53–60 years, and 61–73 years), different ethnic groups (white vs non-white), and participants with and without chronic disease at baseline. Subgroup analyses by sex, age, ethnic origin, and chronic disease were chosen because these factors represent potential confounders for the association between social relations and mortality. Men, individuals belonging to ethnic minorities, elderly people, and those with long-standing illness tend to have fewer social relations and also are at increased risk of mortality.4,  6 Similar three-level age categorisations have been used in a previous study based on UK Biobank data.20 To assess the extent to which baseline biological, behavioural, socioeconomic, psychological, and health-related risk factors explained the associations of social isolation and loneliness with mortality, we calculated the percentage of excess risk mediated (PERM) for the following five groups of explanatory variables: (1) biological (BMI, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and handgrip strength); (2) behavioural (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity); (3) socioeconomic (Townsend deprivation index, education, and household income); (4) psychological factors (depressive symptoms and cognitive performance); and (5) self-rated health.

Finally, all the risk factors were included in the same model simultaneously (final model). To assess the extent to which the associations followed a dose–response pattern, we did dose–response analyses using sum scores from the individual items of the isolation and loneliness measures. We analysed isolation and loneliness separately to assess whether there was a pattern across the continuous score as a predictor of mortality. We accounted for missing data by multiple imputation by chained equations, which generated five imputed datasets.22 The imputation model included age, sex, social isolation, loneliness, all confounding and mediating variables, the Nelson-Aalen estimate of cumulative hazard, and survival status.23 We fitted Cox proportional hazards models within each imputed dataset and combined them in accordance with Rubin's rules.

Aims To assess whether very low birth weight (<1500 g) and low birth weight (1500–2490 g) were associated with higher neuroticism scores assessed in middle age, and lifetime history of either MDD or BD. We controlled for possible confounding factors.  Method Retrospective cohort study using baseline data on the 83 545 UK Biobank participants with detailed mental health and birth weight data.

Whereas this may potentially protect against early mortality, it may have negative sequelae in later life, including susceptibility to some chronic diseases. 7  Low birth weight and MDD A recent meta-analysis which pooled assessments of the association between low birth weight and risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) derived in 18 separate studies, comprising a total of 59 442 participants, did not find evidence for an association once publication bias was taken into account. 2 The authors noted significant heterogeneity between studies, including wide age ranges of participants, different outcome measures, inadequate follow-up rates and low power. Studies also often failed to control for important potential confounders such as maternal smoking or maternal MDD, socioeconomic status, gestational age, gender and family history of MDD, and some studies included extremely low birth weight (<1000 g) participants from specialist hospital environments.

Neuroticism scores were positively skewed, and log/square root transformations did not improve the distribution; we report linear regression statistics because the final results were not meaningfully different from Spearman non-parametric correlations (not shown) but are easier to interpret, and assumptions of normality are to an extent eased in very large data-sets. 19 Because the MDD and BD groups had significantly higher neuroticism scores, as would be expected (both P<0.001), we removed participants with either of these disorders from the neuroticism analyses.  We used Poisson regression to estimate relative risk (RR) ratios for the MDD and BD analyses in relation to birth weight. RR ratios are preferable to odds ratios when the outcome is not rare (i.e. >10%) in the population, as odds ratios are poor estimates of RRs in such circumstances, and are harder to interpret. 20 P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS V.22, except for Fig. 1 which was made by using STATA SE v.13.  We found a positive association between year of birth and birth weight in kilograms, controlling for maternal smoking and maternal depression (r=0.01, P<0.001) suggesting a possible birth cohort effect. We tested each association unadjusted for covariates, and then adjusted for possible confounding variables: year of birth (i.e. controlling for possible age and birth cohort effects), Townsend deprivation score, White v. Black and minority ethnic, gender, maternal smoking and maternal depression. Finally, because physical disorders can be risk factors for psychiatric disorders 21 and are, therefore, potential mediators, for the MDD and BD analyses we added the covariates of hypertension, cardiac disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, type 2 diabetes, COPD and osteoporosis. For each model, we first tested for an overall deleterious very low>low>normal birth weight dose effect, and then for an effect of birth weight group (very low/low) v. normal weight as the referent category.  We formally tested whether significant birth weight and mood disorder associations were mediated by trait neuroticism scores, using the PROCESS macro. 12 Briefly, the effect of a predictor variable (e.g. birth weight group) on an outcome variable (e.g. MDD) can be either direct or indirect via a mediator (e.g. neuroticism). In a mediation context, a three-way association has two products: ‘Path A’: the association between the predictor and mediator (e.g. birth weight and neuroticism), and ‘Path B’: the mediator and outcome association adjusted for the predictor (e.g. association for neuroticism and MDD adjusted for birth weight). The indirect effect is the combined product of these two paths. 11,12 We used the PROCESS macro ‘Model 4’, which allows for dichotomous independent variables/outcomes in mediation models (bootstrap n=1000, bias-corrected).  We excluded all participants who had requested withdrawal from the UK Biobank as of March 2015.

Neuroticism scores were positively skewed, and log/square root transformations did not improve the distribution; we report linear regression statistics because the final results were not meaningfully different from Spearman non-parametric correlations (not shown) but are easier to interpret, and assumptions of normality are to an extent eased in very large data-sets. 19 Because the MDD and BD groups had significantly higher neuroticism scores, as would be expected (both P<0.001), we removed participants with either of these disorders from the neuroticism analyses.  We used Poisson regression to estimate relative risk (RR) ratios for the MDD and BD analyses in relation to birth weight. RR ratios are preferable to odds ratios when the outcome is not rare (i.e. >10%) in the population, as odds ratios are poor estimates of RRs in such circumstances, and are harder to interpret. 20 P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS V.22, except for Fig. 1 which was made by using STATA SE v.13.  We found a positive association between year of birth and birth weight in kilograms, controlling for maternal smoking and maternal depression (r=0.01, P<0.001) suggesting a possible birth cohort effect. We tested each association unadjusted for covariates, and then adjusted for possible confounding variables: year of birth (i.e. controlling for possible age and birth cohort effects), Townsend deprivation score, White v. Black and minority ethnic, gender, maternal smoking and maternal depression. Finally, because physical disorders can be risk factors for psychiatric disorders 21 and are, therefore, potential mediators, for the MDD and BD analyses we added the covariates of hypertension, cardiac disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, type 2 diabetes, COPD and osteoporosis.

In a mediation context, a three-way association has two products: ‘Path A’: the association between the predictor and mediator (e.g. birth weight and neuroticism), and ‘Path B’: the mediator and outcome association adjusted for the predictor (e.g. association for neuroticism and MDD adjusted for birth weight). The indirect effect is the combined product of these two paths. 11,12 We used the PROCESS macro ‘Model 4’, which allows for dichotomous independent variables/outcomes in mediation models (bootstrap n=1000, bias-corrected).""",No,,NA,No follow up measures,,,,,Yes,"""We excluded all participants who had requested withdrawal from the UK Biobank as of March 2015.

There were clear trends whereby the risk of all three increased with reducing birth weight, from normal to very low. Tests of mediation showed that the association between birth weight and MDD was partially mediated by its association with neuroticism.  We found a significant association between low birth weight and higher neuroticism, which survived adjustment for relevant covariates. There was a significant dose effect, such that lower birth weight was associated with higher neuroticism in adulthood (i.e. very low>low>normal). The birth weight/neuroticism associations were characterised by relatively small effect sizes: around a 0.20–0.30 increase in neuroticism scores (out of 12) for low/very low v. normal birth weight. Given the large sample size, statistical significance may not be clinically meaningful, in terms of being a risk factor for MDD/BD.  We found a significant association between low/very low birth weight and increased risk of MDD. This survived adjustment for potential confounding variables and physical disorder history. There appeared to be dose effect, with lower birth weight being associated with higher MDD rates. We found a similar dose effect association for BD. When we separately contrasted very low and low birth weight categories with normal birth weight, we found a significant association between very low birth weight and risk of BD in the unadjusted and confounder- but not mediator-adjusted model (i.e. additionally corrected for physical disorders). Note that sample sizes for the BD analyses were relatively small, and this may contribute to non-significant P-values where the relevant effect sizes are similar or even stronger than in the MDD results.""",Yes,"""The birth weight data in UK Biobank were obtained by asking the participants to recall it in late adulthood. Whereas actual recorded data would be preferable as recall will be subject to inherent noise/error – Inskip et al 24 showed that Bland-Altman plots revealed reasonable agreement between the recalled weight (at assessment) and recorded (hospital record-based) birth weights in 1729 women (Spearman rank r=0.87), although this was in young women. This nonetheless suggests that recalled birth weight is reasonably accurate; when people can recall their birth weight, their recall is quite good, but many, of course, were excluded from these analyses as their birth weight was unknown. It is possible that certain recall biases influence our final results; for example, perhaps participants with chronic illnesses are more likely to recall information such as maternal depression or smoking. There was a significant association between likelihood of reporting birth weight (v. not) and probable MDD/BD; however, this was modest.  The present study corrects for several limitations compared with the recent meta-analysis. However, there are additional variables that were not accounted for, including gestational age, maternal socioeconomic status and pregnancy-related complications such as preterm birth. The classification of probable MDD/BD was based on self-report data which may be subject to under-reporting. The current study does not take into account genetic factors that may contribute to low birth weight or mood disorder, potentially important variables such as parent's socioeconomic status, or whether parent's attitudes or behaviours are different for children with low birth weight. We did not control for multiple births which may contribute to the prevalence of low birth weight in the sample; however, we are not aware of multiple pregnancies being a risk factor for MDD/neuroticism independent of any effect of low birth weight, and it therefore might not act as a confounder.  Participants with lifetime histories of depression may have been less likely to participate in UK Biobank research, and this may interact with other variables such as lower socioeconomic status; the sample may not be entirely representative of psychiatric disease prevalence in a range of different backgrounds. Additionally, developmental problems (such as low birth weight) may result in a bias where the most impaired participants do not reach older age or participate in research.
