7_iv - ICD-10 codes = Partially-External or Yes in terms of diagnostic criteria


6a_ii - we took "source" to sources of participants & therefore the UK BIobank. Different from "setting" question because that we took to mean the setting of the UK Biobank itself

5_vi - we took "dates of data collection" to mean if they included all dates for exposure/outcome, recruitment, beginning & end of follow-up (if used) but could they mean something else + this interpretation means that it is simply a duplicate of 5_iii, 5_iv, and 5_v

8starred_i - NOT duplicate as 6a_ii but was treated as such at start. "source" not defined in guidance. So initally interpreted as sources of data, this made it a duplicate of 6a sources for each variable would be "UK Biobank", later had to reassess this because we reinterpretted it to mean sources of each variable interms of method of measurement (self-completed questionnaire, interview, clinician measurement)

comparability - guidance says "important to know if groups being compared differed with respect to the way in which the data were collected... For instance, if an interviewer first questions all the cases and then the controls, or vice versa, bias is possible because of the learning curve". So this question will always be "Yes" unless authors unclear that *all particpants* measured in same way. Also often NA because only applies if two or more groups being compared (i.e. exposure not continuous)

Distinguishing - subgroups, interactions, & sensitivity analyses was hard

# Rules

Rules are to resolve conflicts not to collect new data so they're directed what consistently we coded

CHECK dependencies  (if these change during conflict resolution it will create more conflicts down the line)
* 1b -> 4 - If 1b is Yes then 4 will be yes because methods fully described in abstract. 
If 1b is Partially or No then see if conflict in 4 and if yes then reassess.
* 7_v -> 12b_i -> 17_i  - subgroup analyses used or not. We defined effect modifiers as terms used in subgroup analyses or interactions but this is not how STROBE seem to do it
* 7_v -> 12_ii -> 17_ii - interaction analyses used or not. We defined effect modifiers as terms used in subgroup analyses or interactions but this is not how STROBE seem to do it

* starred items for 8 items = all NA because
* 12_e -> 17_iii - sensitivity analyses done = results must be reported


Accepted rule I proposed
* 1a - Rule = "prospective" is marked as partially 
* 1b - Rule = missing statistical model is Partially 
* 2_i - Rule = if have intro is Yes -- b/c avoids subjectivity 
* 5_i - Rule = partially have either recruitment details or states its from the UK Biobank but not both
* 6a_iv_coh - Rule = Partially if don't give name of follow-up data source
* all 8 star items = all NA because giving info separately for cases/exposed & controls/unexposed would be irrelevant since both sources/measures are same for both = NA for all
* 13starred_a - Rule = "Yes" if give numbers in UKB, eligible and included
* 14starredb - Rule = "NA" if complete case analysis
* 15starred_coh - Rule = "Yes" if give number of outcome events, don't need rate too
* 16a_v - Rule = "Partially" if missing Townsend quintile boundaries, but name other boundaries
* 20 - Rule = Partially if make policy recommendations

New rule becky & I created
* 4 - Rule = Yes if methods described early on in paper but this includes abstract. 
* 5_v - Rule = Yes if any follow-up date
* 14starredc - Rule = Yes if give any of mean/range/total
* 17_ii - Rule = "Yes"if only p-value or significance indicated for interaction
* 8starred_iii - Rule = "NA" for all studies because everyone had same assessment
* 7, 8starred_ii & 11_i & 11_ii & 11_iii &12_a, 14starred (maybe 16b?) - Rule = go with conservative estimate which is [insert conservative estimate] because hard to resolve if other person looked less so would require extensive checking and debate

# Duplicates - Rule = "NA" for all for higher numbered items
* 6a_ii & 8starred_i - because Becky & Mark took it to mean UK Biobank, KD took it to mean UKB and follow-up sources but this is covered by the more granular detail of 8starred_i (which KD took to mean just UKB)
* 6a_i & 6a_iii & 10 - took 6a_i to mean inclusion in the analysis and took 6a_iii to mean methods of selection into the analysis, which is the same thing.
10 is a duplicate of 6a_i and 6a_iii because all included studies are not novel studies so eligbility criteria covered by 6a_i is justification for sample size.
All of which are the same thing.
* 6a_i NOT duplicate of 5a because guidance we took "recruitment sites or sources" in item 5 to mean recruitment into UKB and took "eligibility criteria...group from which study population was selected" to mean inclusion in the analysis. 

# Answered questions

9 = Yes or No? What would be a partially?
* Yep just binary


11_ii & 11_iii = I used unsure/Partially when no/some groupings defined but unclear if others were, Mark didn't do this
* majority of reviewers treated it one way so yes avoid unsure

if the main results were already separated by a variable (e.g. sex) we treated these as the results not sub-group analyses. We considered sub-group analyses to be those additional to the main analysis (e.g. Malon2016mple7729 the separate analyses are the main analysis)
* define = repeated analysis with stratification

*12_e - what defines a sensitivity analysis
* any check on robustness

13starred_b?
* not duplicate it is a ustifcations for why numbers went down

exclude star questions because too many conflicts?
* restricted to main items because subitems had high conflict rate and 
* too subjective, unsure when it would apply since practically doing it for multiple or continuous exposures would be ridciulous

16c - is it NA?
* NA if not binary outcome, but will probably be No because saw so few

19ii - how define it? what is too harsh?
* Example is not too conservative so discuss magnitude & direction for some or all of their sources of bias

# to ask becky

# questions
* 5_v for cross-sectionals be NA? We agreed on the rule "Rule = Yes if follow-up dates" but this gives a potentially unfair extra point to cross-sectionals that report follow up vs those we mark as NA BUT some cross-sectional studies do use follow up measures as covariates
* Benne2018bank0017 with RR - interactions done as sensitivity analysis so does this mean we complete interaction & sensitivity analyses or one or the other ( I completed interactions, RR did sensitivity analyses)
* 7_v We defined effect modifiers as terms used in subgroup analyses or interactions but this is not how STROBE seem to do it - this OK?
* 7_v becky its

# to confirm rules
* 12b_i & 17_i - Rule = "NA" if not used even though could consider examining subgroups advisable
* 12b_ii & 17_ii - Rule = "NA" if not used even though could consider examining interactions advisable
* 17_ii - Rule = "Partially" if some p-values not exact, unless <.001
* 7_v - Rule = "Yes" if describe variable used in interaction or subgroup analysis
* 12e & 17_iii though not sure this is necessary because we treated all interactions as interactions not sensitivity analyses - Rule = "NA" if sensitivity analysis is an interaction test 
* 7_vi - Rule = NA if BMI because not a disease outcome
* 7_vi - Rule = Partially-External if ICD-10 codes given but not ICD diagnostic criteria
	** what if codes not given and just link to ICD-10?
* 5_i - Rule = , "invited", or "NHS register" get a yes but unsure if "general population" gets a Yes. 
Need to see how BW marked
* 5_iv - Becky said no because don't give dates for when people self-reported their exposure. 
Mark & I interpreted it as date baseline assessments done. 
Partially Mark & I later assigned to references to "baseline" ( 5_iv also needs tidying up)
* 12b_i - Rule = "NA" if subgroup analyses are the main analysis as this is covered by other items
* 12b_ii - Rule = "Partially" if missing statistical tests and don't say how interaction incoroporated into model
* 12c - Rule = "Partially" if some missing data explained but not clearly for all variables

# To do
* 8 starred i - need to import & resolve 
* exposures
* outcomes
* papers I haven't reviewed ~2
* papers others haven't reviewed
* item 4 redo if necessary
* 17_iv = send to Becky & see if there's 
* check duplicates are same (e.g. 6a_i and 6a_iii)
