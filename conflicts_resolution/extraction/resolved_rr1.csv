Up to 600 million people are affected worldwide and COPD is one of the leading causes of mortality.1 COPD is characterized by progressive and largely irreversible airflow limitation resulting in dyspnea. Extrapulmonary features such as fatigue, osteoporosis, cardiac failure, and depression are highly prevalent.2  Patients with COPD can have cognitive impairments, either globally or in single cognitive domains.3 Reported incidence ranges from 12% to 88%.4 Cognitive impairment may be associated with the degree of lung function impairment in patients with COPD5 and has been found to predict mortality in hypoxemic COPD.6 Moreover, cognitive impairment may lead to increased dyspnea and fatigue7 and result in incorrect use of inhaler devices and low compliance with medical treatment as has previously been shown in elderly subjects.8 This might increase the exacerbation risk and could result in worse health outcome.9 To date it remains unknown which domains of cognitive functioning are affected in community-based patients with COPD.10  Insight in cognitive functioning is of great importance to optimize self-management programs for patients with COPD. Indeed, for a patient with COPD, it is important to comply with guidelines for a healthier life style (eg, quit smoking, correct use of medication, and become physically active). Executive functions are evoked for adequate self-management.11 The domain executive functioning is a multifaceted neuropsychological construct, consisting of a set of higher-order neurocognitive processes that contribute to purposeful, goal-directed, and future-oriented behavioral skills, such as organization, planning, problem solving, and reasoning.12 Patients with executive function deficits have difficulties in managing their disease.11 Consequently, cognitive impairments in COPD patients may negatively affect their treatment and in particular the impact of self-management programs.""",Yes,"""To date it remains unknown which domains of cognitive functioning are affected in community-based patients with COPD.10...The aims of the present study were to compare different domains of cognitive functioning between persons in the general population with and without obstructive lung disease (OLD) and to analyze the relationship between cognitive functioning and the degree of airflow limitation.""",Yes,"""The aims of the present study were to compare different domains of cognitive functioning between persons in the general population with and without obstructive lung disease (OLD) and to analyze the relationship between cognitive functioning and the degree of airflow limitation.

More detailed neuropsychological assessment is needed to explore other domains of cognitive functioning in OLD and to control for differences such as motor skills or visual difficulties. Nevertheless, previous studies often only used 1 scale to measure global cognitive functioning (eg, the Mini-Mental State Examination),9, 26 while the current study used a concise testing battery to measure 5 domain-specific cognitive skills. Next to cognitive functioning, other aspects of executive functioning should be investigated in future studies to get a better insight in the role of executive functioning in respiratory diseases. Third, no data were available regarding impact of cognitive impairment in various domains on clinically relevant outcomes (eg, health-related quality of life, exacerbations, and mortality). Also, data on other possible confounders, such as hypoxemia, long-term oxygen therapy,27, 28 obstructive sleep apnea, and overlap syndrome,29 which may affect cognitive functioning, are lacking.

Further assessment of domains of cognitive functioning and the relationship between cognitive impairment and patient-related outcomes is needed to optimize patient-oriented treatment and self-management programs for patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Future studies should also assess the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation and lifestyle factors on the relationship between lung function and cognitive functioning in patients with COPD.

Of those with refractive error within a range eligible for laser refractive surgery (n = 60 352), 1892 (3.1%) reported having bilateral refractive surgery and 549 (0.9%) unilateral surgery. Frequency of bilateral surgery decreased with increasing age and was higher in women. Frequency did not vary with educational attainment or accommodation status but increased with income among working age adults. Social participation, for example, regular visits to a pub or social club, was more common among those who underwent surgery. Other eye conditions were reported by 28% of those reporting refractive surgery compared with 11% of those eligible for treatment but not reporting surgery.  Conclusion This study provides information not available routinely on the frequency and distribution of laser refractive surgery in an adult UK population. A high frequency of ocular conditions conventionally considered contraindications to laser refractive surgery raises the possibility that extant guidance on patient selection may not be followed.""",Yes,"""Refractive error is an important public health issue: it affects at least 30% of the adult population in industrialized countries1, 2 and is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in the world.3, 4 There has been significant progress in the development of surgical interventions for refractive error since the late 1970s.5, 6, 7, 8  In the United Kingdom, only 5% of laser refractive surgery services are hosted within the publicly funded (ie, free at the point of use) National Health Service.9 The lowest cost of LASIK treatment for one eye has remained static at £395 since 2001, although the average cost is nearer £1000 and charges are reported to vary considerably by provider.9 The cost and the elective nature of refractive surgery may influence which individuals undergo LASIK, but, regardless, it is essential to the success of the procedure that it is being offered to appropriate individuals. Guidance on patient selection have been issued by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)5 and includes the need for a stable prescription for the preceding 2 to 3 years, otherwise healthy eyes, having reasonable expectations of the surgery, and absence of some specific conditions, for example, diabetes. The Royal College of Ophthalmologists has issued patient guidance10 and professional standards10 and has initiated a certificate of competence to practice for surgeons who successfully complete appropriate training. Recent surveys indicate an increase in both the number of clinics offering refractive laser surgery in the United Kingdom and the techniques available.9, 11 However, there is a paucity of data on the number of procedures performed and outcomes in the United Kingdom because these procedures are not subject to routine and publicly reported NHS mechanisms.""",Yes,"""UK Biobank is a large prospective study within which 122 000 adults, ages 40 to 69 years, had an ophthalmic assessment, including autorefraction and habitual distance visual acuity.A In addition, diverse and detailed data were collected on sociodemographic factors and medical history, specifically, self-report on eyes/vision included reason for and age of wearing glasses/contact lenses, eye diseases, and treatment received (including refractive laser surgery).

The distribution of refractive error differed between those reporting laser refractive surgery and those who were eligible but did not report surgery, as shown in Table 2. Figure 1 shows the distribution of mean spherical equivalent in those reporting bilateral refractive surgery to be less skewed (ie, shifted toward myopic values) and more leptokurtotic (“peaked”) than that of those not reporting surgery, the latter being consistent with the distribution of mean SE found in similar adult populations.13 In those who had bilateral surgery, the range of mean SE was −0.11 D (range −25.04 to 7.36 D), with 77.3% emmetropic (95% CI, 75.3 to 79.2), 13.6% myopic (95% CI, 12.1 to 15.3), and 9.1% hypertrophic (95% CI, 7.7 to 10.5) (Table 2). In comparison, in those who did not have surgery, the range of mean SE was −24.1 D to 13.9 D (mean 0.17 D), with 45.8% (95% CI, 45.5 to 46.1) emmetropic, 26.5% (95% CI, 26.2 to 26.7) myopic, and 27.7% (95% CI, 27.5 to 28.0) hypertrophic. In those who had laser eye surgery in only 1 eye, manifest spherical equivalent in the operated eye ranged from −19.59 D to 9.19 D (mean −0.4 D), with 47.9% (43.5 to 52.3) emmetropic, 34.8% (30.6 to 39.1) myopic, and 17.4% (14.2 to 20.9) hyperopic. A lower proportion of those reporting bilateral laser eye surgery reported wearing glasses or contact lenses compared with those reporting unilateral surgery or those who had refractive error with no report of surgery (56.3%, 75.6%, and 88.9%, respectively). Frequency of Laser Surgery, Overall and by Age, by Sociodemographic Factors Overall, of those with refractive error eligible for laser refractive surgery 3.1% (3.0 to 3.3) reported bilateral and 0.9% (0.8 to 1.0) unilateral treatment: 4.4% (4.1 to 4.6) in women and 3.7% (3.4 to 3.9) in men. There was a decreasing trend in frequency with age, from 8.6% (7.8 to 9.5) in the younger age group (40 to 44 years) to 2.5% (2.3 to 2.8) in the oldest age group (65 to 69 years) (Table 3). Laser surgery was also more common among those in higher categories of accommodation tenure and with higher educational attainment. There was an increasing trend in frequency of surgery with increasing income in those of pre-retirement age (ie, 40 to 60 years). Among the employed, frequency decreased with age: 7.7% (7.1 to 8.3) (40 to 49 years), 4.2% (3.9 to 4.5) (50 to 59 years), and 2.6 (2.3 to 3.0) (60 to 69 years).  Distribution of Refractive Surgery by Sociodemographic Factors The distributions of age, sex, ethnicity, and socio-economic factors differed between those who had bilateral surgery and those who had refractive error and would have been eligible for refractive surgery but did not report it (Table 4). There were no such differences observed when comparing with the unilateral surgery group.A higher proportion of participants who had refractive surgery were women (60.4% vs 55.9%), were younger (49% vs 26%, age 40 to 54 years), with higher income (34% vs 26% in the range >52k), and of minority ethnicity (89.2% vs 91.6% white) (Table 4). There was some indication that those having surgery were less likely to be in the lowest or highest category of educational qualification or accommodation tenure.  Frequency of Other Self-Reported Ocular Conditions Of note, the frequency of other self-reported eye conditions was higher in the group reporting laser refractive surgery (27.5%) than in those with refractive error but no surgery (11.4%) and those without refractive error (8.1%) (Table 5). Specifically, cataract was reported by 8.9%, ocular trauma by 1.7%, retinal detachment by 2.1%, diabetic eye disease by 3.3%, and glaucoma by 2.5% of those who reported having laser refractive surgery. Because these were cross-sectional data, it was not possible to determine whether these additional ocular disorders occurred before or after refractive surgery.Distribution and Frequency of General Health and Happiness and Social Activity Outcomes There were no consistent differences found in report of general health, happiness, or visits from/to friends between the 2 groups in either distribution or frequency of laser eye surgery (Table 3, Table 6). There were significant differences in the distribution of those reporting social and physical activities. Of those who reported attending a sports/gym club in the preceding month, 39.1% reported treatment versus 28.9% who did not; of those going to a pub or social club, 28.2% reported treatment versus 24.0% who did not; of those attending a religious group, 10.7% reported treatment versus 17.1% who did not; and of those attending other group activities, 19.3% reported treatment versus 23.2% who did not (Table 6). For all activities, the frequency in both groups decreased with age (Table 3).""",no,NA,,No,NA,,No,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,Yes,"Table 1 ""Study Population Non-cycloplegic autorefraction was carried out with the use of the Tomey RC 5000 autorefkeratometer (Tomey Corp).

Residential greenness, a fundamental component of urban design, has been shown to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders. The present study investigates the association between residential green exposure and prevalence of major depressive disorders using a large and diverse cross-sectional dataset from the UK Biobank.  Methods In this cross-sectional, observational, associational study, we used baseline data from the UK Biobank cohort of participants aged 37–73 years from across the UK. Environmental exposure data were derived from a modelled and linked built environment database. Residential greenness was assessed with a 0·5 m resolution Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, which is derived from spectral reflectance measurements in remotely sensed colour infrared data and measured within geocoded dwelling catchments. Other environment metrics included street-level movement density, terrain, and fine particulate exposures. A series of logistic models examined associations between residential greenness and odds of major depressive disorder after adjusting for activity-influencing environments and individual covariates.""",Yes,"""Findings Of 122 993 participants with data on major depressive disorder, the study analytical sample comprised 94 879 (77·1%) participants recruited across ten UK Biobank assessment centres between April 29, 2009, and Oct 1, 2010. A protective effect of greenness on depression was consistently observed, with 4·0% lower odds of major depressive disorder per interquartile increment in Normalised Difference Vegetation Index greenness (odds ratio 0·960, 95% CI 0·93–0·99; p=0·0044). Interaction analyses indicated that the beneficial effects of greenness were more pronounced among women, participants younger than 60 years, and participants residing in areas with low neighbourhood socioeconomic status or high urbanicity.  Interpretation The results point to the benefits of well designed green environments on mental health. Further longitudinal studies are needed to decipher causal pathways. In the UK, policies aimed at optimising allocation and design of green spaces might help preserve psychological ecosystem services, thereby, improving the mental wellbeing of populations and enhancing the mental capital of cities.""",Yes,"""Introduction Given the present unprecedented rate of urbanisation, about 60% of the global population are predicted to reside in cities by 2030, with one in every three people living in cities with at least half a million inhabitants.1 Typically, cities are characterised by highly dense, impervious, built-up spaces and a scarcity of natural environments, with the associated potential effects on mental health. Dynamic stress vulnerability models have reported links between reduced exposure to green environments and enhanced vulnerability to the negative health effects of stressful life events, which can result in increments in the proportion of the population with mental disorders and an overall reduction in the mental capital of cities.2, 3, 4 In recent years, mental disorders, including mood disorders, have emerged as a leading cause of global disease burden. They also act as risk factors for the development of communicable and non-communicable diseases, and contribute to accidental and non-accidental injuries.5, 6, 7 The UK's total annual expenditure on brain disorders was estimated to be approximately €134 billion in 2010, of which €19·24 billion was incurred on mood disorders, accounting for approximately 3·9 million annual cases or 8·73% of all brain disorders.8  The causes of mental health disorders are complex, with a long latency between exposures and subsequent incidence and progression. A systems-based life course approach towards enhancing the mental capital of cities and wellbeing of their populations has been proposed.9 The importance of such a holistic approach has been emphasised by the inclusion of mental health within the Sustainable Development Goals.10, 11 Relatedly, exposure to residential green environment has also been regarded as an effective upstream-level urban intervention with an aim to reduce the public health burden of mental disorders.12  Research in context  Evidence before this study  We searched online databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO, Scopus, and Google/Google Scholar databases, for studies and reports published in English between Jan 1, 1984, and Feb 10, 2018, using a combination of search terms, including “residential greenness”, “green space”, “NDVI”, or “built environment”, and “mental health”, “depression”, or “major depressive disorder”.  Mental health disorders have emerged as a leading cause of the global burden of disease. At the same time, the present unprecedented pace of urbanisation and an increasing proportion of impervious built-up spaces in our cities have resulted in reduced exposures to salutogenic green environments. Several studies have examined the links between exposure to green environments and mental health, with most studies suggesting beneficial effects. Green exposure has been measured in terms of access to green spaces (proportion of green spaces within a residential neighbourhood) as well as the general salutogenic potential of green environments. The protective effects of residential green have been hypothesised to originate from one or more of its functional roles: as restorative stress-relieving spaces; supportive social interaction spaces promoting a sense of community; active living spaces facilitating physical activity; and natural filters ameliorating the adverse effects of negative exposures such as air, noise, and thermal pollution.  Notwithstanding the evidence generated so far, the links between residential green exposure and mental health still remain equivocal in adults. Many of the studies linking residential green exposure with mental health have used coarse measures of green exposure, whereas a few studies have used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index as an index of salutogenic green, although of low-to-moderate spatial resolution. Most studies so far have been small scale and done in homogeneous environmental settings, resulting in limited statistical power and generalisability....Some studies report a beneficial effect of contact with green environments on health, in general,13, 14, 15 and more specifically, with regard to stress, mood, and mental health.16, 17 Several studies have established a protective independent association between various indicators of mental health and the percentage of green space within a residential neighbourhood,18, 19, 20, 21 the amount of tree cover in an urban area,22 and the overall exposure of individuals to salutogenic green environments.23, 24, 25 These protective effects of residential green spaces have been explained in terms of four mechanisms related to their specific functional roles: restorative, stress-relieving spaces;4, 26, 27, 28 supportive, social interaction spaces that promote a sense of community;29 active living spaces that facilitate physical activity;30, 31, 32 and natural filters that ameliorate the adverse effects of air, noise, and thermal pollution.33, 34, 35  Despite the substantial body of evidence, the links between residential green exposure and mental health still remain far from conclusive in adults.17 Many of the studies have used coarse measures of green exposure, expressed as a proportion of greenness based on land cover maps within a specific catchment or census geography, thereby neglecting to include private gardens, street trees, and green spaces that do not meet a specific criterion, such as a size threshold, and hindering the study's replicability and comparability. A few studies have used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an index of greenery derived from Landsat satellite data, as an overall measure of green exposure (although at a low-to-moderate resolution). Most studies so far have been small scale and done in homogeneous environmental settings, resulting in limited statistical power and generalisability. Furthermore, most studies do not adjust for other aspects of activity-influencing built environment and individual-level confounding effects, or consider interaction effects.""",Yes,"""Despite the substantial body of evidence, the links between residential green exposure and mental health still remain far from conclusive in adults.17 Many of the studies have used coarse measures of green exposure, expressed as a proportion of greenness based on land cover maps within a specific catchment or census geography, thereby neglecting to include private gardens, street trees, and green spaces that do not meet a specific criterion, such as a size threshold, and hindering the study's replicability and comparability.

UKBUMP is a high-resolution spatial database of health-influencing environment exposures modelled within multiscale residential neighbourhoods of each UK Biobank participant's geocoded dwelling. Environmental exposure metrics were developed through spatial and network analyses of data from multiple UK-wide spatial databases, resulting in multiple exposure variables related to greenness, urban density, destination accessibility, street-level accessibility, terrain, and deprivation.43, 44 Briefly, UKBUMP was developed by geocoding participants' dwelling addresses to the level of building footprints, delineating multiscale dwelling neighbourhoods by defining street network buffers centred on the geocoded dwelling locations in ArcGIS12 Network Analyst, and measuring environmental exposures within these functional neighbourhoods. After linking the exposure metrics to the participants' dwelling locations, the data were reanonymised. Accurate data on building-level land uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated Transport Network databases, whereas residential greenness was modelled from high-resolution (50 × 50 cm2) colour infrared data captured during aerial photography with the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4.43  Residential greenness Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank participants' dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote sensing device.

The method has been used in active living research and described elsewhere.51, 52 The UK-wide street network data for the study area comprised approximately 4 million street segments, which were extracted from the OS MasterMap Integrated Transport Network database, transcribed into an access graph model, and subjected to network analysis in sDNA53 to model street-level movement density. Movement density is expressed as the simulated counts of movement through each link in the network, given its relative position and topological connectivity with other segments within the network. The measure also acts as a proxy for relative accessibility and centrality of a place.

Individual-level covariates On the basis of previous scientific literature, the study adjusted for demographic covariates (age, sex, highest educational qualification, and employment status), smoking status, and prevalent comorbidities (body-mass index [BMI] status, doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease, and diabetes).  Socioeconomic status was assessed at household and neighbourhood levels in terms of mean annual household income before tax and Townsend deprivation index scores,54 which is a composite index of four postcode-level socioeconomic status variables (household overcrowding, unemployment, non-home ownership, and non-car ownership), with a higher score indicative of lower neighbourhood socioeconomic status.  We used participation in leisure and social activities as a proxy for social interaction and support. Level of participation was based on response to the questionnaire: “Which of the following do you attend once a week or more often? (You can select more than one)”; with available responses being none; pub or social club; religious group; sports club or gym; and adult education class or other group activity. Responses were converted into a six-factor variable: none, pub or social club, religious group, sports club or gym, adult education class and other, and combination of two or more activities.  Statistical analyses The prevalence of lifetime experience of probable major depressive disorder was modelled as a two factor variable (case or non-case) as per UK Biobank's assessment protocol. Age was coded as a three-factor variable (38–50 years, 51–60 years, or 61–73 years) and sex as a two-factor variable (female or male). Highest educational attainment was defined as a five-factor variable (none; O levels, GCSEs, or CSEs; A levels or AS levels; NVQ, HND, HNC, or other professional qualification; or college or university degree) and employment as a three-factor variable (employed; retired; or unemployed, home maker, or other). Mean annual household income before tax was expressed as a four-factor variable (<£18 000, £18 000–£30 999, £31 000–£51 999, or ≥£52 000).

UKBUMP is a high-resolution spatial database of health-influencing environment exposures modelled within multiscale residential neighbourhoods of each UK Biobank participant's geocoded dwelling. Environmental exposure metrics were developed through spatial and network analyses of data from multiple UK-wide spatial databases, resulting in multiple exposure variables related to greenness, urban density, destination accessibility, street-level accessibility, terrain, and deprivation.43, 44 Briefly, UKBUMP was developed by geocoding participants' dwelling addresses to the level of building footprints, delineating multiscale dwelling neighbourhoods by defining street network buffers centred on the geocoded dwelling locations in ArcGIS12 Network Analyst, and measuring environmental exposures within these functional neighbourhoods. After linking the exposure metrics to the participants' dwelling locations, the data were reanonymised. Accurate data on building-level land uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated Transport Network databases, whereas residential greenness was modelled from high-resolution (50 × 50 cm2) colour infrared data captured during aerial photography with the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4.43  Residential greenness Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank participants' dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote sensing device. Chlorophyll in healthy vegetation absorbs radiation in the visible red region (630–690 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflects radiation in the near-infrared region (760–900 nm). This differential in the absorbance and reflectance of wavelengths by chlorophyll is used as a proxy for green quality and intensity. The differential is measured using the following formula:   The formula includes the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the visible (RED) and near-infrared regions (NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Index scores range between −1 and 1, with higher values indicating higher densities of green vegetation.  In the present study, NDVI greenness was derived from a series of 0·5 m resolution, colour-infrared imagery collected by Bluesky (Ashby-De-La-Zouch, UK) with the help of specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Summer-time images of the study areas collected over similar temporal scales (across the baseline phase of the UK Biobank study) were stitched together to avoid temporal mismatch. After excluding large water bodies, we modelled mean NDVI within a 500 m residential buffer of each UK Biobank participant. Selection of a 500 m catchment area for measuring residential green exposures was based on our previous studies46, 47 and on other previous reports48, 49 that used a quarter mile (400–500 m) neighbourhood for measuring NDVI greenness.  Physical environment Among the physical environment exposures, terrain was modelled in ArcGIS12 Spatial Analyst from a 5 m resolution Bluesky digital terrain model and expressed as variability (SD) of slope, in degrees, within a 0·5 km residential catchment of UK Biobank participants' dwellings. As such, the metric is able to differentiate between flat and hilly surface within the residential catchment.  Exposure to PM2·5 obtained from UK Biobank's linked air pollution exposure data was used as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution. The measurement was based on monitoring on three occasions over a 14 day period during the cold, warm, and intermediate seasons of the year.

Accurate data on building-level land uses and street networks were sourced from UK Ordnance Survey AddressBase Premium and MasterMap Integrated Transport Network databases, whereas residential greenness was modelled from high-resolution (50 × 50 cm2) colour infrared data captured during aerial photography with the Vexcel UltraCamD and the Leica ADS4.43  Residential greenness Residential exposure to salutogenic green environment was measured in terms of mean NDVI within a 500 m catchment radius of geocoded UK Biobank participants' dwellings. NDVI is a unit-less index of relative overall vegetation density and quality, and is derived from differential surface reflectance in the red and near infrared regions,45 which is measured with a remote sensing device. Chlorophyll in healthy vegetation absorbs radiation in the visible red region (630–690 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflects radiation in the near-infrared region (760–900 nm). This differential in the absorbance and reflectance of wavelengths by chlorophyll is used as a proxy for green quality and intensity. The differential is measured using the following formula:   The formula includes the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the visible (RED) and near-infrared regions (NIR) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Index scores range between −1 and 1, with higher values indicating higher densities of green vegetation.  In the present study, NDVI greenness was derived from a series of 0·5 m resolution, colour-infrared imagery collected by Bluesky (Ashby-De-La-Zouch, UK) with the help of specially developed sensors mounted underneath a survey aircraft. Summer-time images of the study areas collected over similar temporal scales (across the baseline phase of the UK Biobank study) were stitched together to avoid temporal mismatch. After excluding large water bodies, we modelled mean NDVI within a 500 m residential buffer of each UK Biobank participant. Selection of a 500 m catchment area for measuring residential green exposures was based on our previous studies46, 47 and on other previous reports48, 49 that used a quarter mile (400–500 m) neighbourhood for measuring NDVI greenness.  Physical environment Among the physical environment exposures, terrain was modelled in ArcGIS12 Spatial Analyst from a 5 m resolution Bluesky digital terrain model and expressed as variability (SD) of slope, in degrees, within a 0·5 km residential catchment of UK Biobank participants' dwellings. As such, the metric is able to differentiate between flat and hilly surface within the residential catchment.  Exposure to PM2·5 obtained from UK Biobank's linked air pollution exposure data was used as a proxy for traffic-related air pollution. The measurement was based on monitoring on three occasions over a 14 day period during the cold, warm, and intermediate seasons of the year. Individual annual exposure to particulate matter concentrations around geocoded residential addresses was derived from land-use regression models.50  Built environment Built-environment metrics from UKBUMP were assessed within a 1 km street catchment of participants' dwellings. Street-level movement density was modelled in terms of through-movement potential of the street segments, also termed as betweenness centrality in graph theoretic terminology. The method has been used in active living research and described elsewhere.51, 52 The UK-wide street network data for the study area comprised approximately 4 million street segments, which were extracted from the OS MasterMap Integrated Transport Network database, transcribed into an access graph model, and subjected to network analysis in sDNA53 to model street-level movement density. Movement density is expressed as the simulated counts of movement through each link in the network, given its relative position and topological connectivity with other segments within the network. The measure also acts as a proxy for relative accessibility and centrality of a place. Betweenness centrality of x in a graph of N links might be defined as:  ɛ ɛ  In the formula, y and z are the geodesic endpoints; Ry is the set of links within a defined neighbourhood catchment from y; L(y) is the length of link y and L(z) is the length of link z; and P(z) is the proportion of link z within the defined radius.  The origin-destination function (OD) is defined as:   An objective index of urbanicity within a 1 km residential catchment was developed from the UKBUMP built-environment variables to investigate associations between residential greenness and major depressive disorder, stratified by urbanicity quartiles. Urbanicity was defined as:   The formula includes the density of residential housing (resid), retail (retail), and public transport (PT) in units per km2 street catchment, in addition to street-level movement density (street movement).  Individual-level covariates On the basis of previous scientific literature, the study adjusted for demographic covariates (age, sex, highest educational qualification, and employment status), smoking status, and prevalent comorbidities (body-mass index [BMI] status, doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease, and diabetes).  Socioeconomic status was assessed at household and neighbourhood levels in terms of mean annual household income before tax and Townsend deprivation index scores,54 which is a composite index of four postcode-level socioeconomic status variables (household overcrowding, unemployment, non-home ownership, and non-car ownership), with a higher score indicative of lower neighbourhood socioeconomic status.  We used participation in leisure and social activities as a proxy for social interaction and support. Level of participation was based on response to the questionnaire: “Which of the following do you attend once a week or more often? (You can select more than one)”; with available responses being none; pub or social club; religious group; sports club or gym; and adult education class or other group activity. Responses were converted into a six-factor variable: none, pub or social club, religious group, sports club or gym, adult education class and other, and combination of two or more activities.  Statistical analyses The prevalence of lifetime experience of probable major depressive disorder was modelled as a two factor variable (case or non-case) as per UK Biobank's assessment protocol. Age was coded as a three-factor variable (38–50 years, 51–60 years, or 61–73 years) and sex as a two-factor variable (female or male). Highest educational attainment was defined as a five-factor variable (none; O levels, GCSEs, or CSEs; A levels or AS levels; NVQ, HND, HNC, or other professional qualification; or college or university degree) and employment as a three-factor variable (employed; retired; or unemployed, home maker, or other). Mean annual household income before tax was expressed as a four-factor variable (<£18 000, £18 000–£30 999, £31 000–£51 999, or ≥£52 000). The household income data were available for 82 839 participants in the analytical sample. Townsend scores were categorised into quintiles and used as a five-factor variable. Smoking status was coded as non-smoker, previous smoker, and current smoker. Doctor-diagnosed cardiometabolic disease was transformed into a four-factor variable (none; high blood pressure; heart attack, angina, or stroke; or both high blood pressure and heart attack, angina, or stroke) and diabetes was coded as a two-factor variables (yes or no). Measured BMI status was expressed as a three-factor variable (<25 kg/m2; ≥25 kg/m2 and <30 kg/m2; or ≥30 kg/m2). Terrain variability and walkability (expressed as movement density) were transformed into quartiles.  The study followed a multi-layered analyses strategy.

Objective We aimed to perform cross-sectional analyses of diet group with anthropometric and physiologic characteristics in a large cohort in the United Kingdom.  Design The UK Biobank recruited ∼500,000 middle-aged participants throughout the United Kingdom in 2006–2010. Anthropometric indexes (height, weight, waist and hip circumference, body composition) and other physiologic characteristics (heel bone mineral density, grip strength, blood pressure, pulse rate) were measured following standardized protocols. We estimated the age-adjusted means of each characteristic in 6 diet groups (198,166 regular meat eaters, 199,784 low meat eaters, 4381 poultry eaters, 9674 fish eaters, 6366 vegetarians, and 378 vegans) in white women and men, and in 2 diet groups (3322 meat eaters and 1186 vegetarians) in British Indian women and men.""",Yes,"No test statistics ""Results In white women, after adjustment for age and compared with regular meat eaters, non–red meat eaters had lower adiposity (e.g., 4.5% lower body fat in vegan women) and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure (−4.2 and −3.3 mm Hg, respectively), and generally lower heel bone mineral density t-score (−0.26). Patterns of differences by diet group were similar in white men. In the Indian population, compared with meat eaters, vegetarian women were shorter (−1.1 cm) and had lower lean mass (−0.5 kg), and both vegetarian women and men had lower grip strength (−1.3 and −1.4 kg, respectively). No significant differences in the other characteristics were observed.  Conclusions Differences in anthropometric and physiologic characteristics were observed across diet groups in white participants, but fewer differences were observed in British Indian participants. The observed differences may be important as intermediate markers of long-term health in different diet groups.

At the physical measures station, participants were asked to remove their socks and shoes. Height was measured with the use of the Seca 202 height measure (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Waist (at the natural indent) and hip (widest point) circumferences were measured over light clothes with the use of the Seca-200 tape measure (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Weight and bioimpedance were measured by using the Tanita BC418ma bioimpedance device (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan), from which percentages of body fat and lean mass were estimated. BMI was calculated as weight (kilograms)/height (meters) squared. Calcaneal bone density was taken on the left heel with the use of a Norland McCue Contact Ultrasound Bone Analyzer (Norland, Trumbull, Connecticut, USA), with participants sitting upright; and a heel BMD t-score was calculated on the basis of the measured BMD values. Hand-grip strength for each hand was taken by using the Jamar Hydraulic hand dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, Indiana, USA), and we considered both the higher grip-strength value of either hand and average grip strength of the 2 hands for our analyses. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse rate were taken with the use of the Omron HEM-7015IT digital blood pressure monitor (Omron, Kyoto, Japan) after participants have been seated for ≥5 min, and the averages of 2 measurements, taken ≥1 min apart, were used for analyses.""",Yes,Yes,"""Ethnicity classification On the touch-screen questionnaire, participants were asked to select their ethnicity from options of “White,” “Mixed,” “Asian or Asian British,” “Black or Black British,” “Chinese,” “Other ethnic group,” “Do not know,” or “Prefer not to answer.” Participants were included for analyses if they identified as “white” or as “Asian or Asian British” and subsequently as “Indian.” The white population was included because it made up the majority of the UK Biobank population (∼94%), and the British Indian population was included due to the large proportion of vegetarians in this population group (24.6% compared with 1.7% in the overall cohort)....Diet group classification For classification of diet groups, relevant dietary information from the touch-screen questionnaire was used. Participants were asked their frequency of consumption of processed meat, beef, lamb or mutton, pork, chicken, turkey or other poultry, oily fish, or other types of fish, in 6 categories of frequency ranging from “Never” to “Once or more daily.” Participants were also asked whether they never ate eggs or foods containing eggs or dairy products.  On the basis of these questions, 6 diet groups (regular meat eaters, low meat eaters, poultry eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans) were defined for the white population.

We investigated predictors of mortality in UK Biobank participants during a 5 year period. We aimed to investigate the associations between most of the available measurements and 5 year all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and to develop and validate a prediction score for 5 year mortality using only self-reported information.  Methods Participants were enrolled in the UK Biobank from April, 2007, to July, 2010, from 21 assessment centres across England, Wales, and Scotland with standardised procedures. In this prospective population-based study, we assessed sex-specific associations of 655 measurements of demographics, health, and lifestyle with all-cause mortality and six cause-specific mortality categories in UK Biobank participants using the Cox proportional hazard model. We excluded variables that were missing in more than 80% of the participants and all cardiorespiratory fitness test measurements because summary data were not available. Validation of the prediction score was done in participants enrolled at the Scottish centres. UK life tables and census information were used to calibrate the score to the overall UK population.""",Yes,"""Findings About 500 000 participants were included in the UK Biobank. We excluded participants with more than 80% variables missing (n=746). Of 498 103 UK Biobank participants included (54% of whom were women) aged 37–73 years, 8532 (39% of whom were women) died during a median follow-up of 4·9 years (IQR 4·33–5·22). Self-reported health (C-index including age 0·74 [95% CI 0·73–0·75]) was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in men and a previous cancer diagnosis (0·73 [0·72–0·74]) was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality in women. When excluding individuals with major diseases or disorders (Charlson comorbidity index >0; n=355 043), measures of smoking habits were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality. The prognostic score including 13 self-reported predictors for men and 11 for women achieved good discrimination (0·80 [0·77–0·83] for men and 0·79 [0·76–0·83] for women) and significantly outperformed the Charlson comorbidity index (p<0·0001 in men and p=0·0007 in women). A dedicated website allows the interactive exploration of all results along with calculation of individual risk through an online questionnaire.  Interpretation Measures that can simply be obtained by questionnaires and without physical examination were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality in the UK Biobank population.

Epidemiological studies that obtain several measurements through questionnaires, physical assessments, and biological samples can be done to compare the prognostic value of risk factors of short-term mortality and provide new hypotheses about health determinants. Moreover, these risk factors can be combined into a prognostic index to provide information about individual mortality risk or other health-related measures. Traditionally, association with mortality has been studied for one risk factor at a time,2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and the few studies that have investigated more than one risk factor did not assess different causes of death and based their analyses on small study samples.7 Several prognostic indices for short-term mortality exist, but they have mainly been developed for and assessed in older individuals or in high-risk populations.8, 9 Furthermore, the small sample sizes and the small number of risk factors investigated are the main limitations of all previous studies.""",Yes,"""The UK Biobank project10 includes about 500 000 men and women aged 40–70 years.

Conclusions Although general and central adiposity measures each have profound deleterious effects on the risk of MI in both sexes, a higher waist circumference and waist‐to‐hip ratio conferred a greater excess risk of MI in women than in men. Waist‐to‐hip ratio was more strongly associated with the risk of MI than body mass index in both sexes, especially in women.""",Yes,"!Excess adipose tissue is a major, and increasingly common, risk factor for chronic diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI), the leading cause of death worldwide.1, 2 In 2016, the World Health Organization estimated that more than 40% of women and 39% of men worldwide were overweight (defined as a body mass index [BMI] of >25 kg/m2) and that over 15% of women and 11% of men were obese (BMI >30 kg/m2).3  BMI is the most widely used measure to assess the prevalence of overweight and obesity across populations and to quantify the detrimental effects of excess adipose tissue on the risk of MI in later life. However, BMI is a measure of general adiposity and does not discriminate between adipose tissue present in visceral and subcutaneous areas. Yet, as compared with subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue is more metabolically active, is closely related to insulin resistance, and may be more strongly associated with cardiometabolic risk.4, 5 Measures of central adiposity and body composition, including waist circumference, waist‐to‐hip ratio, and waist‐to‐height ratio, may, therefore, be better suited than BMI for quantifying the etiological relationship between adiposity and cardiovascular disease. Although some studies have reported that measures of central adiposity are more strongly related to cardiovascular risk than BMI,6, 7, 8, 9, 10 others have found minimal differences across anthropometric measures and reported that each measure was similarly associated with the risk of future MI.11, 12  There are substantial sex differences in body fat distribution, with a predominance of subcutaneous fat in women and visceral fat in men.13, 14 Although the association between BMI and the risk of MI is broadly similar between women and men,15 it is conceivable that there is a sex differential in the effects of central adiposity on the risk of MI—with potentially stronger effects in women than men. However, most previous studies did not report the associations between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of MI separately for women and men. Even when sex‐specific results on multiple anthropometric measures were available, direct comparisons between measures for women and men separately were lacking.""",Yes,"""However, most previous studies did not report the associations between measures of general and central adiposity and the risk of MI separately for women and men.
