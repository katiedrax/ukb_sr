Welsh2018bank0945,Association of Total and Differential Leukocyte Counts With Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality in the UK Biobank,KD,Cohort,,ni,,,,ni,,,Never,yes_almost,"""This research was conducted using the UK Biobank resource""",yes_exact,No,No,,Yes,"""Elevated white blood cell count is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We aimed to investigate whether specific leukocyte subpopulations, which may more closely indicate a specific inflammatory pathway, are specifically associated with CVD.  Approach and Results— Participants (478 259) from UK Biobank with data for white blood cell count were included. Death because of CVD (n=1377) and non-CVD causes (n=8987) occurred during median follow-up time of 7.0 years (interquartile range, 6.3–7.6). In Cox models, deciles of leukocyte counts (lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) were examined using the fifth decile as the referent group. Models were stratified by sex and adjusted for a range of classical risk factors. A sensitivity analysis excluded participants with baseline comorbidites and the first 2 years of follow-up. Men (hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.22–2.08) and women (HR, 2.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–3.35) in the highest decile of neutrophil count were at higher risk of CVD mortality and nonfatal CVD (men HR, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.16–1.42 and women HR, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.38). In the sensitivity analysis, the power to investigate CVD mortality was limited, but for both sexes combined, the linear HRs for a 1×109/L cell count increase in white blood cell count and neutrophils, respectively, was 1.05 (1.03–1.07) and 1.07 (1.04–1.11).""",yes,Yes,"""Participants (478 259) from UK Biobank with data for white blood cell count were included.

Conclusions— Among circulating leukocyte subpopulations, neutrophil count in men was most consistently associated with fatal and nonfatal CVD. Further studies of interventions that lower circulating neutrophils, such as canakinumab, are required to investigate causality.""",yes,Yes,"""Introduction Inflammation may be a key, potentially modifiable, process in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD).1,2 Elevated levels of inflammatory mediators within healthy people may increase the risk of CVD. Many studies have reported that a range of different blood-based inflammatory biomarkers are associated with an increased risk of incident CVD events.3–7 This initially led to an interest in reducing the risk of CVD by targeting patients with evidence of inflammation as illustrated by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.8 More recently, with genetic evidence supporting interleukin-6 pathway as causal in the development of CVD,9 interest has emerged in directly inhibiting specific parts of the inflammatory pathway to prevent CVD.10,11  One of the simplest, and most commonly measured markers of the immune response and inflammation, is the total white blood cell (WBC) count. Many studies have reported that an elevated WBC is associated with higher rates of incident CVD12–15 and non-CVD mortality.13,16 The association between elevated WBC and elevated CVD risk may indicate that infection and inflammation are part of the pathway leading to the development of CVD. However, WBC may also reflect poor health and risk of death from any cause and therefore be a nonspecific association.  Different subpopulations of WBC (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils) may also be associated with CVD and non-CVD mortality.14,17,18 In particular, elevated neutrophil counts may be associated with a higher risk of CVD in routine population data sets,18 although the influence of clinical susceptibility bias is difficult to account for in such databases, and the influence of reverse causality requires consideration.19 An additional consideration is that different associations in specific cell types may be suggestive of distinct pathways that lead to CVD. Although neutrophils (granulocytes that comprise the majority of circulating WBCs) can cause tissue damage, including in the walls of blood vessels via the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps,20 which in turn lead to macrophage-produced interleukin precursors,21 other white cell types such as monocytes (precursors of tissue macrophages) may also be important.22""",Yes,"""To explore these associations further, we examined the association between WBC and the differential leukocyte counts with all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, and non-CVD mortality in the UK Biobank population.""",Yes,"""To explore these associations further, we examined the association between WBC and the differential leukocyte counts with all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, and non-CVD mortality in the UK Biobank population.

Recent data from a large cohort study has shown that WBC was associated with coronary heart disease and cancer mortality among healthy women, even after excluding those with comorbidities (CVDs, connective tissue disease, ulcerative colitis, liver disease, diabetes mellitus, or cancers) and early deaths during follow-up.13 The association of WBC with CVD mortality among women in UK Biobank was fairly weak, but the association of neutrophils with CVD we report was strong in both sexes and is also similar to a recent large cohort study.18 Our sensitivity analysis attenuated associations of circulating leukocyte counts with mortality outcomes. This suggests an element of reverse causality.19 Mechanisms that explain this observation likely include the association between neutrophilia and trauma, stress, bacterial infection, smoking, and indolent cancer,29 any of which ultimately might increase the risk of death from any cause. Likewise, lymphopenia is likely to be caused by old age, viral infection, autoimmune disease, renal failure, and immunosuppressive drugs.30 By excluding those with a range of baseline diseases, and those who develop disease within 2 years of baseline, the present results provide models that limit the effect of baseline disease on counts themselves.  What mechanisms might explain the association of leukocytes with CVD mortality? The inflammatory hypothesis of CVD is well established.31 Underpinning this, cellular atherosclerotic plaques appear more prone to rupture.32 It is hypothesized that leukocytes may play a direct role in destabilizing the plaque itself33,34 through fibrous cap thinning, although it may be that circulating levels of leukocytes do not necessarily reflect resident cells within atherosclerotic plaques. Investigating specific differential counts, our data suggest that high circulating neutrophil levels are linearly associated with CVD mortality that occurs beyond a 2-year time horizon in ostensibly healthy people. The same does not seem to be true of other leukocytes. It is interesting that, until recently, neutrophils were a neglected leukocyte in atherosclerosis research. There are clear mechanisms that might explain why neutrophils might play an important role in causing CVD death.35 Neutrophils interact with cholesterol crystals to produce pro-IL-1β.20 They can form structures that bind bacteria and platelets, the end result of which is that neutrophils release nuclear material leading to cell death and thrombosis.36 Neutrophils are, therefore, intimately linked to the inflammatory cascade, which can be promoted through a proatherogenic environment. Other environmental factors, such as smoking,37 might also promote neutrophilia and CVD death, resulting in confounding. However, our sensitivity analysis suggests that there may be an independent association too. Inhibiting IL-1β in patients with established CVD reduces cardiovascular events10,25 and strongly reduces circulating neutrophil counts.26,27 Our findings suggest that further work should be done in patients without preexisting CVD to determine whether IL-1β blockers, or other modulators of the immune response to inflammation, may have a role to play in the prevention of CVD and the role of neutrophils in this context.  Higher neutrophil counts were also associated with a higher risk of non-CVD death. Here, the association may be even more complex. Specific non-CVD conditions may be linked to higher neutrophil counts through different pathways. For instance, there is evidence that people with chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis have increased risk of death beyond that caused by CVD (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.22752/abstract). There has also been speculation that tumor-infiltrating neutrophils may be important in the prognosis of several types of cancer (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044579X13000138). As noted above, mechanisms that may underlie the associations we observe include the influence of indolent malignancy (both solid organ and hematological) and other confounders such as inflammatory diseases and smoking. Although we corrected for as many of these as possible through multivariable analysis and sensitivity analysis, there remains a significant element of confounding and reverse causality. More work is required to examine the association between neutrophils and specific non-CVD causes of death to determine potential mechanisms underlying our findings.  Our study has many strengths. The UK Biobank includes a wide sample of the UK general population in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status and as such is not derived from health records of patients with a clinical indication for leukocyte measurement, in contrast to prior work.18 Further strengths of the study include its large sample size, comprehensive phenotyping, and simultaneous consideration of differential leukocyte counts derived from a central laboratory measurement, also in contrast to prior work.18 The side-by-side comparison of CVD and non-CVD mortality gives an indication of the specificity of associations, although we did not further subdivide non-CVD morality because of lack of adjudicated outcomes. It is notable that inflammatory markers seem to have a stronger association with CVD mortality than with nonfatal events.38,39 Weaknesses include the lack of data to adjust for lipids, although the extensive adjustment model will capture much of this confounding by proxy. Lack of adjustment for medication is a further limitation, although again adjustment for comorbidity accounts for much of the association. Reverse causality is possible in any observational study, and although our results include a sensitivity analysis and an analysis excluding those with diagnosed comorbidities, we cannot exclude the potential of further reverse causality explaining some of the associations that we report.  In conclusion, we report that among leukocytes, higher neutrophil count is particularly associated with higher CVD risk in a general population. This association seems to be robust in those without comorbidity at baseline or in those who may have unrecognized disease at baseline. Further work is required to determine whether modulation of the immune responses that involve neutrophils, via canakinumab or other interventions, can lead to a reduction in CVD mortality.""",No,,Yes,"""The work in this study was supported by a grant from Chest, Heart, and Stroke Association Scotland (Res16/A165).""",No,,No,,No,,,paul.welsh@glasgow.ac.uk,UK,9310,"cardiovascular disease, epidemiology, inflammation, leukocyte count, neutrophils",,,

Many studies have reported that an elevated WBC is associated with higher rates of incident CVD12–15 and non-CVD mortality.13,16 The association between elevated WBC and elevated CVD risk may indicate that infection and inflammation are part of the pathway leading to the development of CVD. However, WBC may also reflect poor health and risk of death from any cause and therefore be a nonspecific association.  Different subpopulations of WBC (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils) may also be associated with CVD and non-CVD mortality.14,17,18 In particular, elevated neutrophil counts may be associated with a higher risk of CVD in routine population data sets,18 although the influence of clinical susceptibility bias is difficult to account for in such databases, and the influence of reverse causality requires consideration.19 An additional consideration is that different associations in specific cell types may be suggestive of distinct pathways that lead to CVD. Although neutrophils (granulocytes that comprise the majority of circulating WBCs) can cause tissue damage, including in the walls of blood vessels via the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps,20 which in turn lead to macrophage-produced interleukin precursors,21 other white cell types such as monocytes (precursors of tissue macrophages) may also be important.22",Yes,"Different subpopulations of WBC (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils) may also be associated with CVD and non-CVD mortality.14,17,18 In particular, elevated neutrophil counts may be associated with a higher risk of CVD in routine population data sets,18 although the influence of clinical susceptibility bias is difficult to account for in such databases, and the influence of reverse causality requires consideration.19 An additional consideration is that different associations in specific cell types may be suggestive of distinct pathways that lead to CVD.

Design: The study was conducted using the UK Biobank resource, a population-based cohort of 40- to 69-year olds. Self-report data on hearing, tinnitus, sleep difficulties, and demographic variables were collected from cochlear implant users (n = 194) and individuals identified as potential candidates for cochlear implantation (n = 211). These “candidates” were selected based on (i) impaired hearing sensitivity, inferred from self-reported hearing aid use and (ii) impaired hearing function, inferred from an inability to report words accurately at negative signal to noise ratios on an unaided closed-set test of speech perception. Data on tinnitus (presence, persistence, and related distress) and on sleep difficulties were analyzed using logistic regression models controlling for gender, age, deprivation, and neuroticism.""",,Yes,"""Results: The prevalence of tinnitus was similar among implant users (50%) and candidates (52%; p = 0.39). However, implant users were less likely to report that their tinnitus was distressing at its worst (41%) compared with candidates (63%; p = 0.02). The logistic regression model suggested that this difference between the two groups could be explained by the fact that tinnitus was less persistent in implant users (46%) compared with candidates (72%; p < 0.001). Self-reported difficulties with sleep were similar among implant users (75%) and candidates (82%; p = 0.28), but participants with tinnitus were more likely to report sleep difficulties than those without (p < 0.001). The prevalence of sleep difficulties was not related to tinnitus persistence (p = 0.28) or the extent to which tinnitus was distressing (p = 0.55). Conclusions: The lack of association between tinnitus persistence and sleep difficulties is compatible with the notion that tinnitus is suppressed in implant users primarily during active electrical stimulation and may return when the implant is switched off at night time. This explanation is supported by the similar prevalence of sleep problems among implant users and potential candidates for cochlear implantation, despite differences between the groups in tinnitus persistence and related emotional distress. Cochlear implantation may therefore not be an appropriate intervention where the primary aim is to alleviate sleep difficulties""",partially,Yes,"""Introduction Tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of an external stimulus, affects about 16% of the adult population (Dawes et al. 2014; McCormack et al. 2014). Hearing loss has been established as a major risk factor for tinnitus (Nondahl et al. 2011). It has been suggested that degraded auditory input due to cochlear damage can trigger aberrant neuronal activity that is interpreted as tinnitus (Preece et al. 2003; Eggermont & Roberts 2014). The burden imposed by tinnitus is complex and extends beyond the persistence of the percept itself. The overall perceived handicap can include hearing difficulties, anxiety, depression, inability to relax, and sleep difficulties (Tyler & Baker 1983; Langguth 2011; McCormack et al. 2015). This heterogeneity in symptoms is reflected in the wide variety of proposed treatments, many of which are not supported by strong evidence for their effectiveness (Baguley et al. 2013).  Patients and clinicians agree that the management of tinnitus in those with profound hearing loss remains one of the top priorities for future tinnitus research (Hall et al. 2013). One potential device that has been proposed to manage tinnitus in the profoundly deaf is the cochlear implant (CI), which is an established intervention to restore useful aspects of hearing in these patients (Faulkner & Pisoni 2013). Cochlear implantation involves the surgical placement of an electrode array within the cochlea to stimulate spiral ganglion cells electrically to convey auditory information (Loizou 1998). On average, as many as 80% of candidates for cochlear implantation report experiencing tinnitus but the percept appears to subside in many after implantation (Baguley & Atlas 2007). As a result, it has been suggested that cochlear implantation should be considered as a treatment for tinnitus in the profoundly deaf (Tyler et al. 2008b). However, there remains a lack of comprehensive assessments of the burden of tinnitus and tinnitus-related symptoms after cochlear implantation (Baguley 2010) and therefore a lack of evidence for which symptoms may or may not be alleviated by implantation.  Many studies that have evaluated the impact of cochlear implantation on tinnitus have assessed outcome in terms of relief from the percept, for example, the reduction in tinnitus loudness (for a review see Baguley & Atlas 2007; Arts et al. 2012). Other studies have focused on designing and optimizing electrical stimulation strategies to suppress the percept (Chang & Zeng 2012; Arts et al. 2015). The assumption is that the suppression of tinnitus will alleviate its intrusiveness and reduce overall burden. However, although the number of profoundly deaf patients reporting tinnitus decreases following implantation, clinical observations suggest that a large proportion of CI recipients still experience some degree of tinnitus-related handicap (Pan et al. 2009; Bovo et al. 2011; Kloostra et al. 2015; Ramakers et al. 2015). A review of studies that have assessed the levels of tinnitus-related handicap following implantation suggested that about 25% of CI users experience a clinically significant tinnitus, that is, a degree of tinnitus-related handicap that may warrant intervention (Baguley 2010).  The presence of tinnitus after implantation may be explained by the finding that tinnitus is suppressed mostly when the implant is stimulating the auditory nerve and often reverts back to its original loudness (or becomes louder) soon after stimulation is turned off (Zeng et al. 2011; Vlastarakos et al. 2014). Therefore, it is plausible that tinnitus could be still bothersome in CI users at night time if the CI is switched off before going to sleep (Chadha et al. 2009), and consequently that they would not experience a reduction in the occurrence of tinnitus-related insomnia. However, despite the decades of research and converging evidence that sleep difficulties are one of the most common tinnitus-related complaints (Tyler & Baker 1983; Langguth 2011), the treatment of tinnitus-related insomnia remains an outstanding uncertainty for both clinicians and patients (Hall et al. 2013).Few studies have assessed the association between tinnitus and sleep difficulties in CI users, or whether the presence of tinnitus leads to sleep difficulties after patients turn their CI off at night time. One observational study on a small sample of adult CI users has suggested that implant use may reduce sleep difficulties in some, but not all, patients (Di Nardo et al. 2007), but the factors that contribute to that reduction remain unclear.""",Yes,"""Few studies have assessed the association between tinnitus and sleep difficulties in CI users, or whether the presence of tinnitus leads to sleep difficulties after patients turn their CI off at night time.

Tinnitus still appears to cause considerable distress in a subset of implanted individuals. However, the data available in the UK Biobank were mostly retrospective and based on self-report and may not accurately reflect participants’ overall level of tinnitus-related distress. The self-reports of CI users might have been influenced by their experience of hearing restoration and/or by the hearing and speech therapy they received following implantation (Pan et al. 2009). However, the lack of general quality of life assessments did not allow for these or other potential psychological effects on well-being and reported tinnitus persistence or distress to be controlled for. While tinnitus can be experienced throughout the day, participants in the UK Biobank were only asked to judge their level of tinnitus-related distress during the periods when their tinnitus is at its worst, for example, when their CI is switched off. If so, the present results may overstate the overall level of distress experienced by CI users. If distress had been measured throughout the day, the difference in distress reported by the CI and candidate groups may have been even more pronounced.  One possible explanation for the lower level of tinnitus persistence among CI users is that they may have regained access to sound following implantation that could suppress or mask their tinnitus and/or reduce the extent to which they attend to their tinnitus. These effects could plausibly lead to a decrease in the perceived loudness of tinnitus and potentially give some relief from tinnitus-related emotional distress. However, neither suppression nor reduced attention to tinnitus may be fully effective or lasting if only due to the fact that currently CI stimulation is optimized for speech perception and may not be optimal for the suppression of tinnitus (Chang & Zeng 2012). Thus, many CI users will likely still experience periods of loud and distressing tinnitus as they did before implantation.

Questions about sleep in the UK Biobank study were not asked in the context of tinnitus. Therefore, the reported difficulties with sleep may have been unrelated to tinnitus but related to other factors, for example, other age-related health problems. However, self-reported difficulties with sleep were highly prevalent in all participants reporting current tinnitus. This association between tinnitus presence and sleep difficulties was found even after controlling for neuroticism, a factor shown to be associated with both tinnitus (McCormack et al. 2014, 2015) and sleep problems (Hintsanen et al. 2014).  Sleep difficulties did not vary as a function of either tinnitus persistence or distress. This finding is consistent with the fact that participants were asked to rate distress based on how much the tinnitus “noises” upset them. Consequently, the reported distress was likely driven by hearing tinnitus persistently (Fig. 3) rather than sleep problems. Additional analyses also determined that the prevalence of sleep difficulties was not influenced by HA use or by poor speech perception (Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/EANDH/A294). Thus, the presence of sleep difficulties appears to be predicated primarily on whether tinnitus is present or not, and would therefore be expected to occur in a majority of those who experience tinnitus.

If one also assumes that the candidate group was representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK, then the proportion of patients reporting current tinnitus of any kind (56%) was lower than the average estimate of 80% in CI candidates (lower limit of 67%) extrapolated from results of a number of studies (Baguley & Atlas 2007).

One possible explanation for these discrepancies is that the UK Biobank study sampled from the middle-aged UK population (40 to 69 years old) and therefore excluded both younger and older adult CI users and candidates.  Clinical Implications The absence of an association between tinnitus persistence, tinnitus distress, and difficulties with sleep reported here suggests that cochlear implantation may not be an appropriate intervention where the primary motivation is tinnitus suppression for the alleviation of tinnitus-related insomnia. Nevertheless, elevated sleep difficulties remain a significant contributor to perceived tinnitus-related emotional distress, and cases of undiagnosed insomnia may be present among tinnitus patients (Miguel et al. 2014). Insomnia management should therefore still be considered for any patient experiencing tinnitus, including CI users.  The results of the present study suggest that tinnitus is less persistent in those who use a CI compared with those identified as potential candidates for a CI despite similar prevalence of tinnitus in both groups. The results also suggest that the level of tinnitus persistence in CI users is similar to that observed in unaided participants with good speech perception in noise (Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/EANDH/A294). However, the limited information in the UK Biobank study on hearing loss and the type or number of devices used means that uncertainty remains as to whether (a) the difference in tinnitus persistence observed between CI users and potential candidates was a direct result of the devices used and (b) the subset of HA users identified as potential candidates were representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK. If the finding of lower tinnitus persistence among CI users compared with candidates is replicated in further observational and controlled studies, cochlear implantation could be considered as a potential treatment option for persistent and emotionally distressing tinnitus in those whose hearing loss may not otherwise make them a candidate. In those cases, implantation may have the potential to make tinnitus less persistent, possibly leading to a reduction in emotional distress.  The recognized breadth of observed symptoms among tinnitus patients has and continues to drive efforts toward delineating subtypes of tinnitus to provide tailored treatments and improve individual outcomes (Tyler et al. 2008a; Langguth 2011; COST Action BM1306: TINNET 2013). It is somewhat surprising therefore that, in the case of CI users, the focus appears to remain on suppressing the percept of tinnitus (Arts et al. 2012, 2015; Chang & Zeng 2012; Vlastarakos et al. 2014; Ramakers et al. 2015), with relatively less attention given to the characterization and management of other tinnitus-related symptoms. The present results suggest that CI users may experience a relief in tinnitus persistence, but not a complete abolition of tinnitus or tinnitus-related distress. Studies investigating other aspects of tinnitus handicap in CI users are encouraging (e.g., anxiety and depression; Andersson et al. 2009; Olze et al. 2011; Kloostra et al. 2015), but a more comprehensive characterization of tinnitus symptoms is still needed to understand the burden of tinnitus after cochlear implantation.

Hearing loss has been established as a major risk factor for tinnitus (Nondahl et al. 2011). It has been suggested that degraded auditory input due to cochlear damage can trigger aberrant neuronal activity that is interpreted as tinnitus (Preece et al. 2003; Eggermont & Roberts 2014). The burden imposed by tinnitus is complex and extends beyond the persistence of the percept itself. The overall perceived handicap can include hearing difficulties, anxiety, depression, inability to relax, and sleep difficulties (Tyler & Baker 1983; Langguth 2011; McCormack et al. 2015). This heterogeneity in symptoms is reflected in the wide variety of proposed treatments, many of which are not supported by strong evidence for their effectiveness (Baguley et al. 2013).  Patients and clinicians agree that the management of tinnitus in those with profound hearing loss remains one of the top priorities for future tinnitus research (Hall et al. 2013). One potential device that has been proposed to manage tinnitus in the profoundly deaf is the cochlear implant (CI), which is an established intervention to restore useful aspects of hearing in these patients (Faulkner & Pisoni 2013). Cochlear implantation involves the surgical placement of an electrode array within the cochlea to stimulate spiral ganglion cells electrically to convey auditory information (Loizou 1998). On average, as many as 80% of candidates for cochlear implantation report experiencing tinnitus but the percept appears to subside in many after implantation (Baguley & Atlas 2007). As a result, it has been suggested that cochlear implantation should be considered as a treatment for tinnitus in the profoundly deaf (Tyler et al. 2008b). However, there remains a lack of comprehensive assessments of the burden of tinnitus and tinnitus-related symptoms after cochlear implantation (Baguley 2010) and therefore a lack of evidence for which symptoms may or may not be alleviated by implantation.  Many studies that have evaluated the impact of cochlear implantation on tinnitus have assessed outcome in terms of relief from the percept, for example, the reduction in tinnitus loudness (for a review see Baguley & Atlas 2007; Arts et al. 2012). Other studies have focused on designing and optimizing electrical stimulation strategies to suppress the percept (Chang & Zeng 2012; Arts et al. 2015). The assumption is that the suppression of tinnitus will alleviate its intrusiveness and reduce overall burden. However, although the number of profoundly deaf patients reporting tinnitus decreases following implantation, clinical observations suggest that a large proportion of CI recipients still experience some degree of tinnitus-related handicap (Pan et al. 2009; Bovo et al. 2011; Kloostra et al. 2015; Ramakers et al. 2015). A review of studies that have assessed the levels of tinnitus-related handicap following implantation suggested that about 25% of CI users experience a clinically significant tinnitus, that is, a degree of tinnitus-related handicap that may warrant intervention (Baguley 2010).  The presence of tinnitus after implantation may be explained by the finding that tinnitus is suppressed mostly when the implant is stimulating the auditory nerve and often reverts back to its original loudness (or becomes louder) soon after stimulation is turned off (Zeng et al. 2011; Vlastarakos et al. 2014). Therefore, it is plausible that tinnitus could be still bothersome in CI users at night time if the CI is switched off before going to sleep (Chadha et al. 2009), and consequently that they would not experience a reduction in the occurrence of tinnitus-related insomnia. However, despite the decades of research and converging evidence that sleep difficulties are one of the most common tinnitus-related complaints (Tyler & Baker 1983; Langguth 2011), the treatment of tinnitus-related insomnia remains an outstanding uncertainty for both clinicians and patients (Hall et al. 2013).""",Yes,"""Few studies have assessed the association between tinnitus and sleep difficulties in CI users, or whether the presence of tinnitus leads to sleep difficulties after patients turn their CI off at night time.

Design:  The study was conducted using the UK Biobank resource, a population-based cohort of 40- to 69-year olds. Self-report data on hearing, tinnitus, sleep difficulties, and demographic variables were collected from cochlear implant users (n = 194) and individuals identified as potential candidates for cochlear implantation (n = 211). These “candidates” were selected based on (i) impaired hearing sensitivity, inferred from self-reported hearing aid use and (ii) impaired hearing function, inferred from an inability to report words accurately at negative signal to noise ratios on an unaided closed-set test of speech perception. Data on tinnitus (presence, persistence, and related distress) and on sleep difficulties were analyzed using logistic regression models controlling for gender, age, deprivation, and neuroticism. Results:  The prevalence of tinnitus was similar among implant users (50%) and candidates (52%; p = 0.39). However, implant users were less likely to report that their tinnitus was distressing at its worst (41%) compared with candidates (63%; p = 0.02). The logistic regression model suggested that this difference between the two groups could be explained by the fact that tinnitus was less persistent in implant users (46%) compared with candidates (72%; p < 0.001). Self-reported difficulties with sleep were similar among implant users (75%) and candidates (82%; p = 0.28), but participants with tinnitus were more likely to report sleep difficulties than those without (p < 0.001). The prevalence of sleep difficulties was not related to tinnitus persistence (p = 0.28) or the extent to which tinnitus was distressing (p = 0.55). Conclusions:  The lack of association between tinnitus persistence and sleep difficulties is compatible with the notion that tinnitus is suppressed in implant users primarily during active electrical stimulation and may return when the implant is switched off at night time. This explanation is supported by the similar prevalence of sleep problems among implant users and potential candidates for cochlear implantation, despite differences between the groups in tinnitus persistence and related emotional distress. Cochlear implantation may therefore not be an appropriate intervention where the primary aim is to alleviate sleep difficulties. Introduction Tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of an external stimulus, affects about 16% of the adult population (Dawes et al. 2014; McCormack et al. 2014).

However, despite the decades of research and converging evidence that sleep difficulties are one of the most common tinnitus-related complaints (Tyler & Baker 1983; Langguth 2011), the treatment of tinnitus-related insomnia remains an outstanding uncertainty for both clinicians and patients (Hall et al. 2013).  Few studies have assessed the association between tinnitus and sleep difficulties in CI users, or whether the presence of tinnitus leads to sleep difficulties after patients turn their CI off at night time. One observational study on a small sample of adult CI users has suggested that implant use may reduce sleep difficulties in some, but not all, patients (Di Nardo et al. 2007), but the factors that contribute to that reduction remain unclear. The aims of the present study were therefore to (i) estimate the prevalence of sleep difficulties among adult CI users and those who may be candidates for implantation and (ii) examine the associations between sleep difficulties, tinnitus characteristics, and tinnitus-related emotional distress.  Methods Participants The data were obtained from the UK Biobank resource. The UK Biobank baseline health data were collected in 2007 to 2010 from over 500,000 people aged 40 to 69 years who were invited to participate based on their residence proximity to a UK Biobank Assessment Center (Allen et al. 2014).

Further analyses revealed that this group difference was driven by the lower persistence of their tinnitus (Fig. 3): participants who reported tinnitus as less persistent were more likely to report a lower level of emotional distress as a result of their tinnitus.

Authors state  ""Questions about sleep in the UK Biobank study were not asked in the context of tinnitus. Therefore, the reported difficulties with sleep may have been unrelated to tinnitus but related to other factors, for example, other age-related health problems. However, self-reported difficulties with sleep were highly prevalent in all participants reporting current tinnitus. This association between tinnitus presence and sleep difficulties was found even after controlling for neuroticism, a factor shown to be associated with both tinnitus (McCormack et al. 2014, 2015) and sleep problems (Hintsanen et al. 2014).""  The present data cannot provide definitive estimates of the effect of implantation on tinnitus because it is not known whether tinnitus reported as occurring only in the past was abolished before or after implantation. If one assumes reporting moderately or severely distressing tinnitus as “significant” enough to consider additional tinnitus management options after implantation (Andersson et al. 2009), the estimate of 37% of CI users found in the present study (Table 3) would be somewhat higher than the 25% of “clinically significant” tinnitus estimated from data reported in other studies (Baguley 2010). If one also assumes that the candidate group was representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK, then the proportion of patients reporting current tinnitus of any kind (56%) was lower than the average estimate of 80% in CI candidates (lower limit of 67%) extrapolated from results of a number of studies (Baguley & Atlas 2007).

",No,,Partially,"Generally cautious in interpretation of findings   e.g."" the limited information in the UK Biobank study on hearing loss and the type or number of devices used means that uncertainty remains as to whether (a) the difference in tinnitus persistence observed between CI users and potential candidates was a direct result of the devices used and (b) the subset of HA users identified as potential candidates were representative of those who are eligible to receive a CI in the UK. If the finding of lower tinnitus persistence among CI users compared with candidates is replicated in further observational and controlled studies, cochlear implantation could be considered as a potential treatment option for persistent and emotionally distressing tinnitus in those whose hearing loss may not otherwise make them a candidate. In those cases, implantation may have the potential to make tinnitus less persistent, possibly leading to a reduction in emotional distress.""  ""Studies investigating other aspects of tinnitus handicap in CI users are encouraging (e.g., anxiety and depression; Andersson et al. 2009; Olze et al. 2011; Kloostra et al. 2015), but a more comprehensive characterization of tinnitus symptoms is still needed to understand the burden of tinnitus after cochlear implantation. It is only through such understanding that appropriate interventions for alleviating the burden of tinnitus in implant users can be identified and developed.""
