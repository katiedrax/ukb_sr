Significant elevations in the levels of interleukin 6 and tumour necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-a) are present in both AS and periodontitis patients. 10,11  Due to the difficulties in conducting population- based studies using clinical diagnosis, self-reported disease is an alternative way of diagnosis. Selfreported AS was shown to be agreeable with the clinical records 12 , whereas self-reported periodontal disease was shown to be agreeable with the clinical diagnosis of periodontitis. 13 It was also shown that the reporting of the number of natural teeth, presence or absence of prosthetic appliance, and root canal filling by the patients was agreeable with the clinical findings for these patients. 14""","""Many studies have shown that lower muscle function is associated with greater mortality and morbidity.567891011121314 For example, in 1<U+2009>142<U+2009>599 male adolescents (age 16-19 years) followed up over 24 years, low muscle strength was associated with higher all cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease but not from cancer.8 Recent data from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study (n=139<U+2009>691 adults aged 35-70 years followed up for four years) showed that grip strength was inversely associated with all cause mortality and with non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular mortality, but no significant association was found with respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.7 Moreover, lower grip strength was found to be positively associated with incident cancer in high income countries but not in middle or lower income countries. The authors of this study concluded that, although some data support an association between grip strength and mortality, further research is needed to confirm this association with other health outcomes.7""",""" Introduction The main role of skeletal muscle is to control body movements through the generation of force. Skeletal muscle is also the primary protein store within the body and in chronic conditions, such as cancer, and it can provide gluconeogenic precursors that are crucial for survival as such conditions progress.1 In addition to this, skeletal muscle is the primary outlet for glucose disposal in the body and is therefore important in metabolic conditions such as diabetes.2 Muscle mass is also decreased (cachexia) in many conditions, such as cancer, respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, and chronic infection and sepsis.3 With these broad physiological and functional roles, skeletal muscle has a critical, but often underrated, role in health.4  Many studies have shown that lower muscle function is associated with greater mortality and morbidity.567891011121314 For example, in 1<U+2009>142<U+2009>599 male adolescents (age 16-19 years) followed up over 24 years, low muscle strength was associated with higher all cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease but not from cancer.8 Recent data from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study (n=139<U+2009>691 adults aged 35-70 years followed up for four years) showed that grip strength was inversely associated with all cause mortality and with non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular mortality, but no significant association was found with respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.7 Moreover, lower grip strength was found to be positively associated with incident cancer in high income countries but not in middle or lower income countries. The authors of this study concluded that, although some data support an association between grip strength and mortality, further research is needed to confirm this association with other health outcomes.7  Therefore, clear evidence shows that low grip strength is associated with a range of poorer health outcomes.567891011121314 Furthermore, grip strength enhances prediction of mortality based on age (C index increase from 0.65 for age to 0.69 for age+grip strength) and sex (C index increase from 0.54 for sex to 0.63 for sex+grip).14 However, whether the addition of handgrip strength to a traditional office based risk score (including age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, presence of diabetes, and body mass index15) improves risk prediction is unclear.

Several studies have shown that CVD and vascular calcification are associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and greater risk of fractures [6, 7].

Grip strength was measured as previously described,19 and the mean of the right and left values was expressed in absolute units (kg) for subsequent analysis. Physical activity was based on self report, using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form,20 and total physical activity was calculated as the sum of walking and moderate and vigorous activity, measured as metabolic equivalents (MET-min/week). We derived total time spent in sedentary behaviours from the sum of self reported time spent driving, using a computer, and watching television.  Dietary information was collected via the Oxford WebQ, a web based 24 hour recall questionnaire that was developed specifically for use in large population studies.2122 We derived area based socioeconomic status from the postcode of residence, using the Townsend score.23 We calculated age from dates of birth and baseline assessment. We categorised smoking status into never, former, and current smoking. We collected medical history (physician’s diagnosis of depression, stroke, angina, heart attack, hypertension, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or longstanding illness) from the self completed baseline assessment questionnaire. Trained nurses measured height and body weight during the initial assessment centre visit. We calculated body mass index as weight/height2 and used the World Health Organization’s criteria to classify it into categories of underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5 to <25), overweight (25 to <30), obese (30 to <35), obesity class 2 (35 to <40), and obesity class 3 (=40). Trained nurses measured body composition (body fat and fat free mass) by using bio-impedance. Further details of these measurements can be found in the UK Biobank’s online protocol (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk).""",see methods,"Do not give original items for questionnaire measures and unclear if categories are the original response options or grouped ""Exposures Grip strength (GS) GS was assessed once in each hand using a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Jamar J00105, Lafayette, IN, USA), which can measure isometric grip force up to 90<U+2009>kilograms. The device has good reliability and reproducibility.21 Staff calibrated the device at the start of each measurement day. Each participant was asked to sit upright on a chair with their forearm on the armrest, and then grasp the handle of the device in their right hand. They were required to maintain a 90° angle of their elbow adjacent to their side so that their thumb would face upwards, while squeezing the handle as strongly as possible for ~3<U+2009>s. The same protocol was performed with the left hand. For the current analysis, we used average values of the two hands; unless the value from only one hand was available (n=233). Sex- and age-specific quintiles of GS were generated for analyses (Supplementary Table 1).  Adiposity measures Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing measured weight (kg) by measured height squared (m2). Waist circumference (WC) was measured by a tape measure at the level of the umbilicus. For the present analyses, BMI (kg<U+2009>m-2) was categorised as normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9), obesity class I (30.0–34.9) and obesity class II (<U+2A7E>35.0). A total of 62 men and 373 women who were underweight (BMI<18.5 kg<U+2009>m-2) were excluded from the analyses because of small sample size. Three categories of WC were generated according to the following sex-specific cut points: <U+2A7D>79.9<U+2009>cm, 80.0–87.9<U+2009>cm and <U+2A7E>88.0<U+2009>cm for women, and <U+2A7D>93.9<U+2009>cm, 94.0–101.9<U+2009>cm and <U+2A7E>102.0<U+2009>cm for men.22  Physical activity outcomes Accelerometer data collection An invitation to participate in the PA sub-study was emailed between February 2013 and December 2015 to 236<U+2009>519 participants who had given a valid email address upon recruitment. Participants in the North West region who had been involved in other sub-studies were not invited for accelerometer measurement due to the potential participant burden. Enclosed in an envelope, a tri-axial accelerometer (Axivity AX3, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK23) configured to capture three-dimensional acceleration at 100<U+2009>Hz with a dynamic range of ±8<U+2009>g was mailed, along with instructions on proper use of the device, to consenting participants, who were asked to start wearing the monitor on the dominant wrist (defined as the hand that participants typically use to write) upon receipt and for the next 7 days. Devices were programmed to start and finish recording at pre-specified times. Participants were requested to send the monitor back to the co-ordinating centre in a provided pre-paid envelope at the end of the 7-day monitoring period.  Accelerometer data processing Raw accelerometry data were calibrated to local gravity (1<U+2009>g) with temperature compensation17 and filtered to dampen machine noise using a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20<U+2009>Hz. Euclidean Norm Minus One was calculated as the Euclidean Norm (vector magnitude) of the acceleration in three axes minus one gravitational unit (1<U+2009>g), with any negative values truncated to zero. Non-wear was identified as time periods of <U+2A7E>60<U+2009>min where standard deviations of all three axes were <13.0<U+2009>milli-g (1<U+2009>milli-g=0.001<U+2009>g). Overall PA volume (average Euclidean Norm Minus One) and intensity distribution (5-sec resolution) were summarised for each individual activity record, while minimising diurnal bias caused by non-wear.24 Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was defined as Euclidean Norm Minus One values greater than 125<U+2009>milli-g, and expressed in min<U+2009>day-1. Participants with <72<U+2009>h of wear time or Euclidean Norm Minus One <U+2A7E>500<U+2009>milli-g were excluded from the analysis. Previous research found wrist-worn accelerometry to be valid for assessing PA intensity25 and energy expenditure.18, 26  Covariates We included the following variables as covariates in the analysis: age, ethnicity (White, mixed, Asian/Asian British, Black/Black British, others), smoking status (never, previous, current), alcohol consumption (never, previous, currently <3 times/week, currently <U+2A7E>3 times/week), employment (unemployed and employed), Townsend Area Deprivation Index (a composite score of employment, car ownership, home ownership and household overcrowding, with higher values indicating a given area’s higher degree of deprivation), severe medical conditions (any of heart attack/stroke/cancer), follow-up time (between baseline assessment and accelerometry measurement), monitor wear time (hours/day), season of accelerometer wear (two orthogonal sine functions), TV time (60-min increments) and baseline self-reported MVPA (min per day). Self-reported MVPA time was calculated as the sum of walking time, non-walking moderate (frequency × duration), and vigorous (frequency × duration) activity time, all of which were reported through questions adapted from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.27""",See methods,"Missing assessment measures for almost all confounders but links to UK Biobank questionnaire ""Demographic and clinical assessment Participants completed a series of computer-based questionnaires followed by face-to-face interviews with trained research staff. Details of the assessments and variables are publicly available (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/), and a transcript of the questionnaire may be downloaded (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Touch_screen_questionnaire.pdf?phpMyAdmin=trmKQlYdjjnQIgJ%2CfAzikMhEnx6). Information collected included socio-demographics (gender, age, ethnicity and educational attainment), lifestyle factors (including smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity) and self-reported physician-diagnosed comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, diabetes and cancer). Details regarding calcium and vitamin D use and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in women were also obtained. The questionnaire asked participants to report any doctor’s diagnosis of cardiovascular morbidities such as coronary artery disease (combining angina and myocardial infarction), stroke and diabetes, and for all regular medications to be listed. Weight and height measurements were obtained for calculation of BMI (kg/m2); systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP) were measured using the Omron HEM-7015IT digital blood pressure monitor. History of fracture was self-reported. All participants were asked if they had broken a bone in the past 5 years and if yes, at which of the following specific sites: ankle, leg, hip, spine, wrist, arm or other bones. A further question asked if the fracture resulted from a simple fall (low-trauma fracture). Combining this information, ‘fragility fracture’ was defined as a low-trauma (occurring as a result of a fall) fracture involving the hip, spine, wrist or arm. ‘Other’ and ‘unknown’ fractures were excluded from subsequent analyses. Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) (db/MHz) and speed of sound (SOS) (m/s) were measured at least twice on each calcaneum with a SAHARA sonometer (Hologic, Marlborough, USA) and left and right mean values used for analysis. Intermalleolar distance (‘ankle spacing width’) was also recorded, as soft tissue thickness may influence heel ultrasound indices. Measures of BUA were available for 485,899 of the 502,664 participants who attended the health examination and completed the health and lifestyle questionnaire.  Ascertainment of outcomes Information on incident hospital admission for ischaemic heart disease (IHD I20-I25) and for acute myocardial infarction (I21) or angina (I20, which includes both unstable and stable angina) was obtained through linkage to UK Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). The remaining ICD10 codes included the following: subsequent myocardial infarction within 4 weeks after a first event, complications of myocardial infarction, other acute ischaemic heart disease and chronic ischaemic heart disease. HES data are produced through coding and central reporting of diagnoses underlying hospital admissions nationwide. All study subjects were followed up until any ischaemic cardiovascular event, death or until 29th February 2016, yielding a mean follow-up time of 7 years and a maximum time of 10 years.""",see methods,"Missing response options for confounders e.g. smoking, postmenopausal hormone use, parity, alcohol ""Participants were followed via record linkage to the NHS Central Registers which provide information on cancer diagnoses coded according to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) [20]...Coffee consumption Information on coffee consumption was collected at the time of the recruitment visit using a short touchscreen self-reported food frequency questionnaire that included 29 questions on commonly consumed food groups based on the expected distribution in the UK as well as some common sources of various nutrients [21, 22]. This questionnaire asked about the frequency of consumption over the past year of vegetables, fruit, fish, meats, cheese, salt added to food, tea, water, milk, bread, cereal, as well as cups of coffee (“How many cups of coffee do you drink each day?”) and type of coffee most commonly consumed (“What type of coffee do you usually drink?”). To assess validity and reproducibility of this diet assessment tool, the results reported on the initial questionnaire were compared with the diet reported at a subsequent repeated assessment (with the median time between two assessments<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.4 years) as well as with the results from 24-h food frequency questionnaire completed during follow-up by a sub-sample of participants. There was good agreement between reported consumption at recruitment and at the repeat assessment as well as good agreement between diet from initial and 24-h food frequency questionnaires suggesting that UK Biobank food frequency questionnaire was able to reliably rank participants according to their consumption of main food groups [22].  Even though a subset of individuals in the UK Biobank also completed follow-up questions on coffee consumption at subsequent visits, as follow-up information on coffee consumption was missing for majority of the participants (><U+2009>95%), only baseline data were used in the analysis. Consistent with previous studies [5], coffee consumption categories were defined as <<U+2009>7 cups/week, 1 cup/day, 2–3 cups/day, and 4+ cups/day.  Covariate information Information on breast cancer risk factors was extracted from baseline questionnaire and updates. Weight and height for body mass index (BMI) calculation were measured at every visit to the study assessment center. BMI at recruitment was calculated as kg/m2. Race/ethnicity was defined using 2001 Census and the Health Survey for England classifications and re-coded for the purpose of this analysis due to extremely small numbers for racial/ethnic groups other than Caucasian. Family history of breast cancer was defined as having any first degree relative with breast cancer diagnosis. As inherited genetic susceptibility may not have fully manifested at the time of the entry into the study, we supplemented data on family history from baseline with those from the follow-up visits to fully capture this information. Information on smoking, alcohol use, and parity and age at first birth were extracted from baseline.  Statistical analysis Distributions of breast cancer risk factors among women with and without breast cancer were compared with t-test and Chi-square test. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze the association between coffee consumption and breast cancer risk while adjusting for known breast cancer risk factors. The follow-up time for women with breast cancer began at study entry and ended at breast cancer diagnosis. The follow-up for cancer-free women began at baseline and ended at the time of death or the last linkage with Cancer Registry data (30 November 2014 for England and Wales or 31 December 2014 for Scotland), whichever came first. The risk estimates were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The models were adjusted for known breast cancer risk factors, including race/ethnicity (Caucasian [reference], other), BMI (<<U+2009>18.5 [underweight], 18.5 to <<U+2009>25 [normal weight, reference], 25 to <<U+2009>30 [overweight], and =<U+2009>30 [obese]), parity/age at first child’s birth (nulliparous, parous with age at first birth<U+2009>=<U+2009>25, parous with age at first birth<U+2009>><U+2009>25, parous with unknown age at first birth), family history of breast cancer in first degree relatives (any, none [reference]), age at menopause (<<U+2009>46 [reference], 46 to <<U+2009>50, 50 to <<U+2009>55, =<U+2009>55 years), postmenopausal hormone use (never [reference], past, current), smoking (never [reference], past, current), and alcohol consumption (never [reference], past, current)."""

We also did analyses using a sex specific cut-off point for clinically relevant muscle weakness (supplementary table B), as recommended by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Sarcopenia Project.24 We investigated potential sex interactions by fitting a multiplicative interaction term into the models between grip strength (kg) and sex; although we found no significant interactions for the effect of grip strength on health outcomes by sex, we have presented stratified analyses because levels of grip strength differ significantly between woman and men (supplementary table C).""","""Procedures Date of death and date and cause of hospital admissions were identified as described previously.19 We defined incident cardiovascular disease as a hospital admission or death with ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes I60, I61, I63, I64, I21, I21.4, and I21.9. We defined respiratory disease as ICD-10 codes J09-J98 and I26-I27 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as ICD-10 code J44. We defined all cause cancer as an ICD-10 code of C0.0-C9.9, D3.7-9, or D4.0-8 recorded on the cancer registry, death certificate, or hospital admission. We defined cause specific cancers by using the following ICD-10 codes recorded on the cancer registry, death certificate, or hospital admission: breast cancer (C50), prostate cancer (C61), lung cancer (C34), and colorectal cancer (C18, C19, and C20).  Grip strength was measured as previously described,19 and the mean of the right and left values was expressed in absolute units (kg) for subsequent analysis. Physical activity was based on self report, using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form,20 and total physical activity was calculated as the sum of walking and moderate and vigorous activity, measured as metabolic equivalents (MET-min/week). We derived total time spent in sedentary behaviours from the sum of self reported time spent driving, using a computer, and watching television.  Dietary information was collected via the Oxford WebQ, a web based 24 hour recall questionnaire that was developed specifically for use in large population studies.2122 We derived area based socioeconomic status from the postcode of residence, using the Townsend score.23 We calculated age from dates of birth and baseline assessment. We categorised smoking status into never, former, and current smoking. We collected medical history (physician’s diagnosis of depression, stroke, angina, heart attack, hypertension, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or longstanding illness) from the self completed baseline assessment questionnaire. Trained nurses measured height and body weight during the initial assessment centre visit. We calculated body mass index as weight/height2 and used the World Health Organization’s criteria to classify it into categories of underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5 to <25), overweight (25 to <30), obese (30 to <35), obesity class 2 (35 to <40), and obesity class 3 (=40). Trained nurses measured body composition (body fat and fat free mass) by using bio-impedance. Further details of these measurements can be found in the UK Biobank’s online protocol (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk).""",see methods,"""Exposures Grip strength (GS) GS was assessed once in each hand using a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Jamar J00105, Lafayette, IN, USA), which can measure isometric grip force up to 90<U+2009>kilograms. The device has good reliability and reproducibility.21 Staff calibrated the device at the start of each measurement day. Each participant was asked to sit upright on a chair with their forearm on the armrest, and then grasp the handle of the device in their right hand. They were required to maintain a 90° angle of their elbow adjacent to their side so that their thumb would face upwards, while squeezing the handle as strongly as possible for ~3<U+2009>s. The same protocol was performed with the left hand. For the current analysis, we used average values of the two hands; unless the value from only one hand was available (n=233). Sex- and age-specific quintiles of GS were generated for analyses (Supplementary Table 1).  Adiposity measures Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing measured weight (kg) by measured height squared (m2). Waist circumference (WC) was measured by a tape measure at the level of the umbilicus. For the present analyses, BMI (kg<U+2009>m-2) was categorised as normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9), obesity class I (30.0–34.9) and obesity class II (<U+2A7E>35.0). A total of 62 men and 373 women who were underweight (BMI<18.5 kg<U+2009>m-2) were excluded from the analyses because of small sample size. Three categories of WC were generated according to the following sex-specific cut points: <U+2A7D>79.9<U+2009>cm, 80.0–87.9<U+2009>cm and <U+2A7E>88.0<U+2009>cm for women, and <U+2A7D>93.9<U+2009>cm, 94.0–101.9<U+2009>cm and <U+2A7E>102.0<U+2009>cm for men.22  Physical activity outcomes Accelerometer data collection An invitation to participate in the PA sub-study was emailed between February 2013 and December 2015 to 236<U+2009>519 participants who had given a valid email address upon recruitment. Participants in the North West region who had been involved in other sub-studies were not invited for accelerometer measurement due to the potential participant burden. Enclosed in an envelope, a tri-axial accelerometer (Axivity AX3, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK23) configured to capture three-dimensional acceleration at 100<U+2009>Hz with a dynamic range of ±8<U+2009>g was mailed, along with instructions on proper use of the device, to consenting participants, who were asked to start wearing the monitor on the dominant wrist (defined as the hand that participants typically use to write) upon receipt and for the next 7 days. Devices were programmed to start and finish recording at pre-specified times. Participants were requested to send the monitor back to the co-ordinating centre in a provided pre-paid envelope at the end of the 7-day monitoring period.  Accelerometer data processing Raw accelerometry data were calibrated to local gravity (1<U+2009>g) with temperature compensation17 and filtered to dampen machine noise using a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20<U+2009>Hz. Euclidean Norm Minus One was calculated as the Euclidean Norm (vector magnitude) of the acceleration in three axes minus one gravitational unit (1<U+2009>g), with any negative values truncated to zero. Non-wear was identified as time periods of <U+2A7E>60<U+2009>min where standard deviations of all three axes were <13.0<U+2009>milli-g (1<U+2009>milli-g=0.001<U+2009>g). Overall PA volume (average Euclidean Norm Minus One) and intensity distribution (5-sec resolution) were summarised for each individual activity record, while minimising diurnal bias caused by non-wear.24 Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was defined as Euclidean Norm Minus One values greater than 125<U+2009>milli-g, and expressed in min<U+2009>day-1. Participants with <72<U+2009>h of wear time or Euclidean Norm Minus One <U+2A7E>500<U+2009>milli-g were excluded from the analysis. Previous research found wrist-worn accelerometry to be valid for assessing PA intensity25 and energy expenditure.18, 26  Covariates We included the following variables as covariates in the analysis: age, ethnicity (White, mixed, Asian/Asian British, Black/Black British, others), smoking status (never, previous, current), alcohol consumption (never, previous, currently <3 times/week, currently <U+2A7E>3 times/week), employment (unemployed and employed), Townsend Area Deprivation Index (a composite score of employment, car ownership, home ownership and household overcrowding, with higher values indicating a given area’s higher degree of deprivation), severe medical conditions (any of heart attack/stroke/cancer), follow-up time (between baseline assessment and accelerometry measurement), monitor wear time (hours/day), season of accelerometer wear (two orthogonal sine functions), TV time (60-min increments) and baseline self-reported MVPA (min per day). Self-reported MVPA time was calculated as the sum of walking time, non-walking moderate (frequency × duration), and vigorous (frequency × duration) activity time, all of which were reported through questions adapted from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.27  Statistical analyses Characteristics of the participants at baseline were summarised by sex and BMI category. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the associations of adiposity and GS with the two PA outcomes of average acceleration and MVPA. First, models were fit to estimate associations of adiposity (BMI and WC) with PA, with adjustment for age (Model 1). Remaining aforementioned covariates were additionally adjusted for in subsequent models (Model 2), and finally GS was added (Model 3). A parallel series of models using GS as the primary exposure variable were fit with adjustment for age (Model 1) and additional adjustment for remaining covariates (Model 2), with final adjustment for BMI (Model 3). The GS-activity associations were also estimated, stratified by BMI or WC category, and in parallel the adiposity-activity associations were estimated, stratified by GS quintile (all adjusted for the same covariates as in Model 3); interactions between each exposure and the stratification variable were tested using a multiplication term. All exposure variables were standardised for each sex to facilitate comparison of the strength of association found for different exposures with the same outcome variable. The two PA outcome variables were log-transformed, as the models using untransformed outcome variables did not meet assumptions of normality and heteroscedasticity of residuals. Adjusted means of acceleration and MVPA time for each GS quintile and adiposity category were estimated using marginal effects from the regression analysis. """,see methods,"Missing assessment measures for almost all confounders so unsure how they were handled in the analyses ""Demographic and clinical assessment Participants completed a series of computer-based questionnaires followed by face-to-face interviews with trained research staff. Details of the assessments and variables are publicly available (http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/), and a transcript of the questionnaire may be downloaded (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Touch_screen_questionnaire.pdf?phpMyAdmin=trmKQlYdjjnQIgJ%2CfAzikMhEnx6). Information collected included socio-demographics (gender, age, ethnicity and educational attainment), lifestyle factors (including smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity) and self-reported physician-diagnosed comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, diabetes and cancer). Details regarding calcium and vitamin D use and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in women were also obtained. The questionnaire asked participants to report any doctor’s diagnosis of cardiovascular morbidities such as coronary artery disease (combining angina and myocardial infarction), stroke and diabetes, and for all regular medications to be listed. Weight and height measurements were obtained for calculation of BMI (kg/m2); systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP) were measured using the Omron HEM-7015IT digital blood pressure monitor. History of fracture was self-reported. All participants were asked if they had broken a bone in the past 5 years and if yes, at which of the following specific sites: ankle, leg, hip, spine, wrist, arm or other bones. A further question asked if the fracture resulted from a simple fall (low-trauma fracture). Combining this information, ‘fragility fracture’ was defined as a low-trauma (occurring as a result of a fall) fracture involving the hip, spine, wrist or arm. ‘Other’ and ‘unknown’ fractures were excluded from subsequent analyses. Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) (db/MHz) and speed of sound (SOS) (m/s) were measured at least twice on each calcaneum with a SAHARA sonometer (Hologic, Marlborough, USA) and left and right mean values used for analysis. Intermalleolar distance (‘ankle spacing width’) was also recorded, as soft tissue thickness may influence heel ultrasound indices. Measures of BUA were available for 485,899 of the 502,664 participants who attended the health examination and completed the health and lifestyle questionnaire.  Ascertainment of outcomes Information on incident hospital admission for ischaemic heart disease (IHD I20-I25) and for acute myocardial infarction (I21) or angina (I20, which includes both unstable and stable angina) was obtained through linkage to UK Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). The remaining ICD10 codes included the following: subsequent myocardial infarction within 4 weeks after a first event, complications of myocardial infarction, other acute ischaemic heart disease and chronic ischaemic heart disease. HES data are produced through coding and central reporting of diagnoses underlying hospital admissions nationwide.

Design Prospective population based study.  Setting UK Biobank.  Participants 502<U+2009>293 participants (54% women) aged 40-69 years.  Main outcome measures All cause mortality as well as incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer (all cancer, colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate).  Results Of the participants included in analyses, 13<U+2009>322 (2.7%) died over a mean of 7.1 (range 5.3-9.9) years’ follow-up. In women and men, respectively, hazard ratios per 5 kg lower grip strength were higher (all at P<0.05) for all cause mortality (1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.23, and 1.16, 1.15 to 1.17) and cause specific mortality from cardiovascular disease (1.19, 1.13 to 1.25, and 1.22, 1.18 to 1.26), all respiratory disease (1.31, 1.22 to 1.40, and 1.24, 1.20 to 1.28), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.24, 1.05 to 1.47, and 1.19, 1.09 to 1.30), all cancer (1.17, 1.13 to 1.21, 1.10, 1.07 to 1.13), colorectal cancer (1.17, 1.04 to 1.32, and 1.18, 1.09 to 1.27), lung cancer (1.17, 1.07 to 1.27, and 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), and breast cancer (1.24, 1.10 to 1.39) but not prostate cancer (1.05, 0.96 to 1.15). Several of these relations had higher hazard ratios in the younger age group. Muscle weakness (defined as grip strength <26 kg for men and <16 kg for women) was associated with a higher hazard for all health outcomes, except colon cancer in women and prostate cancer and lung cancer in both men and women. The addition of handgrip strength improved the prediction ability, based on C index change, of an office based risk score (age, sex, diabetes diagnosed, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and smoking) for all cause (0.013) and cardiovascular mortality (0.012) and incidence of cardiovascular disease (0.009).  Conclusion Higher grip strength was associated with a range of health outcomes and improved prediction of an office based risk score. Further work on the use of grip strength in risk scores or risk screening is needed to establish its potential clinical utility.  Introduction The main role of skeletal muscle is to control body movements through the generation of force. Skeletal muscle is also the primary protein store within the body and in chronic conditions, such as cancer, and it can provide gluconeogenic precursors that are crucial for survival as such conditions progress.1 In addition to this, skeletal muscle is the primary outlet for glucose disposal in the body and is therefore important in metabolic conditions such as diabetes.2 Muscle mass is also decreased (cachexia) in many conditions, such as cancer, respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, and chronic infection and sepsis.3 With these broad physiological and functional roles, skeletal muscle has a critical, but often underrated, role in health.4  Many studies have shown that lower muscle function is associated with greater mortality and morbidity.567891011121314 For example, in 1<U+2009>142<U+2009>599 male adolescents (age 16-19 years) followed up over 24 years, low muscle strength was associated with higher all cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease but not from cancer.8 Recent data from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study (n=139<U+2009>691 adults aged 35-70 years followed up for four years) showed that grip strength was inversely associated with all cause mortality and with non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular mortality, but no significant association was found with respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.7 Moreover, lower grip strength was found to be positively associated with incident cancer in high income countries but not in middle or lower income countries. The authors of this study concluded that, although some data support an association between grip strength and mortality, further research is needed to confirm this association with other health outcomes.7  Therefore, clear evidence shows that low grip strength is associated with a range of poorer health outcomes.567891011121314 Furthermore, grip strength enhances prediction of mortality based on age (C index increase from 0.65 for age to 0.69 for age+grip strength) and sex (C index increase from 0.54 for sex to 0.63 for sex+grip).14 However, whether the addition of handgrip strength to a traditional office based risk score (including age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, presence of diabetes, and body mass index15) improves risk prediction is unclear. Such analysis will allow us to determine whether measurement of grip strength has clinical utility for risk prediction in settings where blood based measures are not readily available (for example, community/rural settings or low/middle income countries).  A meta-analysis (53<U+2009>476 participants) published in 2010 showed that grip strength was associated with lower all cause mortality; the association seemed to be weaker in studies in which participants had an average age of 60 years or less, relative to those with a higher average age at baseline.6 The relatively small sample size in this analysis limited the ability to fully explore how associations vary with age. The Tromso study (6850 participants, age 50-80 years) found associations between low grip strength and mortality,5 but no interaction with age was observed; again, power was limited by low participant numbers in this study. The large size of the UK Biobank cohort provides the opportunity to robustly determine whether the association between grip strength and health outcomes differs by age.  The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the associations of grip strength with all cause mortality and disease specific incidence and mortality, how these associations vary with age, and whether the addition of grip strength improves the prediction ability of established office based risk scores, in the UK Biobank, a very large, general population cohort.  Methods Between April 2007 and December 2010, UK Biobank recruited 502<U+2009>628 participants (5.5% response rate after invitation letters sent to around 9 million people), aged 40-69 years, from the general population.16 Participants attended one of 22 assessment centres across England, Wales, and Scotland,1718 where they completed a touch screen questionnaire, had physical measurements taken, and provided biological samples, as described in detail elsewhere.1718 The outcomes in the study reported here were incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease, all respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, all cancers, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer, as well as all cause mortality, with the exposure variable being grip strength (age and sex specific quarters and 5 kg increase in grip strength). We treated sociodemographic factors (age, sex, ethnicity, and area based socioeconomic status), month of recruitment, smoking status, height, body mass index, and self reported physical activity, sedentary time, and dietary intake as potential confounders, as well as prevalent diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, cancer, and longstanding illness at baseline (where participants with these conditions were not excluded from the analyses).  Procedures Date of death and date and cause of hospital admissions were identified as described previously.19 We defined incident cardiovascular disease as a hospital admission or death with ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes I60, I61, I63, I64, I21, I21.4, and I21.9. We defined respiratory disease as ICD-10 codes J09-J98 and I26-I27 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as ICD-10 code J44. We defined all cause cancer as an ICD-10 code of C0.0-C9.9, D3.7-9, or D4.0-8 recorded on the cancer registry, death certificate, or hospital admission. We defined cause specific cancers by using the following ICD-10 codes recorded on the cancer registry, death certificate, or hospital admission: breast cancer (C50), prostate cancer (C61), lung cancer (C34), and colorectal cancer (C18, C19, and C20).  Grip strength was measured as previously described,19 and the mean of the right and left values was expressed in absolute units (kg) for subsequent analysis. Physical activity was based on self report, using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form,20 and total physical activity was calculated as the sum of walking and moderate and vigorous activity, measured as metabolic equivalents (MET-min/week). We derived total time spent in sedentary behaviours from the sum of self reported time spent driving, using a computer, and watching television.  Dietary information was collected via the Oxford WebQ, a web based 24 hour recall questionnaire that was developed specifically for use in large population studies.2122 We derived area based socioeconomic status from the postcode of residence, using the Townsend score.23 We calculated age from dates of birth and baseline assessment. We categorised smoking status into never, former, and current smoking. We collected medical history (physician’s diagnosis of depression, stroke, angina, heart attack, hypertension, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or longstanding illness) from the self completed baseline assessment questionnaire. Trained nurses measured height and body weight during the initial assessment centre visit. We calculated body mass index as weight/height2 and used the World Health Organization’s criteria to classify it into categories of underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5 to <25), overweight (25 to <30), obese (30 to <35), obesity class 2 (35 to <40), and obesity class 3 (=40). Trained nurses measured body composition (body fat and fat free mass) by using bio-impedance. Further details of these measurements can be found in the UK Biobank’s online protocol (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk).  Statistical analyses We used multivariable cubic regression splines to visually explore non-linear associations between grip strength and health outcomes. As we found no evidence of deviation from linearity, we investigated the associations of grip strength with cause specific incidence and mortality over follow-up with Cox proportional hazard models. We reported the results as hazard ratios together with 95% confidence intervals. The models for incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer excluded participants with a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, or stroke), respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cancer at baseline, respectively.  Firstly, we treated grip strength as a continuous variable and calculated hazard ratios per 5 kg decrement in grip strength for men and women separately. To enable comparability with other reports in the literature, we also calculated hazard ratios for age and sex specific quarters of grip strength (supplementary table A), with participants in the highest quarter for grip strength used as the reference group. We also did analyses using a sex specific cut-off point for clinically relevant muscle weakness (supplementary table B), as recommended by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Sarcopenia Project.24 We investigated potential sex interactions by fitting a multiplicative interaction term into the models between grip strength (kg) and sex; although we found no significant interactions for the effect of grip strength on health outcomes by sex, we have presented stratified analyses because levels of grip strength differ significantly between woman and men (supplementary table C).  For Cox proportional hazard analyses, we ran four models that included an increasing number of covariates: model 0 (minimally adjusted) included sociodemographic covariates (age, sex, ethnicity, Townsend index, and month of recruitment); model 1 was adjusted as in model 0 but also included height; model 2 was adjusted as in model 1 but also included prevalent morbidity (hypertension, diabetes, depression, and longstanding illness, as well as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer when these were not the outcome); model 3 (fully adjusted) was adjusted as in model 2 but also included lifestyle factors (smoking status, body mass index categories, total physical activity, total sedentary time, and dietary intake of alcohol, fruit and vegetables, oily fish, red meat, and processed meat)....  We then investigated whether these associations differed by age by doing a two way interaction analysis and fitting a handgrip strength*age interaction term to our model. We then repeated our Cox proportional hazard analyses (models 3 and 4) stratified by age categories (=55, 56-65, and >65 years). ... We checked the proportional hazard assumption by tests based on Schoenfeld residuals. We used Stata 14 statistical software for all analyses.""",see methods,"""Open Access Published: 22 May 2017 Clinical Studies and Practice  Adiposity and grip strength as long-term predictors of objectively measured physical activity in 93<U+2009>015 adults: the UK Biobank study Y Kim, T White, K Wijndaele, S J Sharp, N J Wareham & S Brage  International Journal of Obesity volume 41, pages1361–1368(2017)Cite this article  882 Accesses  16 Citations  18 Altmetric  Metricsdetails  Abstract Background/Objectives: Fatness and fitness are associated with physical activity (PA) but less is known about the prospective associations of adiposity and muscle strength with PA. This study aimed to determine longitudinal associations of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and grip strength (GS) with objectively measured PA.  Subjects/Methods: Data are from the UK Biobank study. At baseline (2006–2010), BMI, WC and GS were objectively measured. At follow-up (2013–2015), a sub-sample of 93<U+2009>015 participants (52<U+2009>161 women) wore a tri-axial accelerometer on the dominant wrist for 7 days. Linear regression was performed to investigate longitudinal associations of standardised BMI, WC and GS at baseline with moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and acceleration after a median 5.7-years follow-up (interquartile range: 4.9–6.5 years).  Results: Linear regression revealed strong inverse associations for BMI and WC, and positive associations for GS with follow-up PA; in women, MVPA ranges from lowest to highest quintiles of GS were 42–48<U+2009>min<U+2009>day-1 in severely obese (BMI<U+2A7E>35<U+2009>kg<U+2009>m-2), 52–57<U+2009>min<U+2009>day-1 in obese (30<U+2A7D>BMI<35<U+2009>kg<U+2009>m-2), 61–65<U+2009>min<U+2009>day-1 in overweight (25<U+2A7D>BMI<30<U+2009>kg<U+2009>m-2) and 69–75<U+2009>min<U+2009>day-1 in normal weight (18.5<U+2A7D>BMI<25<U+2009>kg<U+2009>m-2). Follow-up MVPA was also lower in the lowest GS quintile (42–69<U+2009>min<U+2009>day-1) compared with the highest GS quintile (48–75<U+2009>min<U+2009>day-1) across BMI categories in women. The pattern of these associations was generally consistent for men, and in analyses using WC and mean acceleration as exposure and outcome, respectively.  Conclusions: More pronounced obesity and poor strength at baseline independently predict lower activity levels at follow-up. Interventions and policies should aim to improve body composition and muscle strength to promote active living.  Download PDF Introduction Increasing physical activity (PA) levels is an important public health priority as physical inactivity is associated with increased risks of mortality as well as cardiovascular events.1 Studies2, 3, 4 have been performed to examine correlates and determinants of PA in order to inform interventions and policies aimed at increasing PA levels. Of various genetic, biological, behavioural and environmental factors influencing PA, adiposity was found to be inversely associated with PA in previous cross-sectional studies.5, 6, 7, 8 Some longitudinal studies reported that higher adiposity levels at baseline were associated with lower PA levels at follow-up.9, 10, 11, 12  In addition to adiposity, grip strength (GS), as a proxy measure for overall muscle strength,13 has been known to be a correlate of PA.8, 14, 15 The longer-term relationship between GS and self-report PA has been examined in one previous longitudinal study.16 In fact, all but one10 prior longitudinal studies9, 11, 12, 16 in this area of research employed self-report methods to quantify PA, which are more susceptible to measurement errors compared with the objective measures of PA, such as accelerometers. Accelerometers provide more accurate estimates of PA,17, 18 thereby making it easier to disentangle the true associations between PA, adiposity and GS. Moreover, there has been no longitudinal investigation to examine the interplay of adiposity and GS relative to objectively assessed PA. Future PA may be more dependent upon baseline adiposity than strength or vice versa. Hence, it is critical from both epidemiological and public health perspectives to understand the relative contribution of adiposity and GS to PA, in order to promote physically active lifestyles. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the independent and joint longitudinal associations of adiposity and GS with objectively measured PA in middle-aged and older adults participating in a large-scale prospective cohort.  Methods Study design and participants This study uses data collected from the UK Biobank study, which is an ongoing national cohort study of >500<U+2009>000 UK adults aged 40–69 years at recruitment. The inclusion criteria included living <25 miles away from one of 22 assessment centres across the UK and being registered with the National Health Service. Each participant underwent baseline measurements between 2006 and 2010 collecting a comprehensive series of genetic, behavioural and biological variables, including measurements of body composition and GS. Several years later (2013–2015), 103<U+2009>720 of the cohort participated in a sub-study in which their PA was objectively measured by wrist accelerometry.19 More detailed descriptions about the rationales and methodology of the UK Biobank project are provided elsewhere.20 Each participant signed informed consent before participation. The UK Biobank protocol was approved by the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee.  Exposures Grip strength (GS) GS was assessed once in each hand using a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Jamar J00105, Lafayette, IN, USA), which can measure isometric grip force up to 90<U+2009>kilograms. The device has good reliability and reproducibility.21 Staff calibrated the device at the start of each measurement day. Each participant was asked to sit upright on a chair with their forearm on the armrest, and then grasp the handle of the device in their right hand. They were required to maintain a 90° angle of their elbow adjacent to their side so that their thumb would face upwards, while squeezing the handle as strongly as possible for ~3<U+2009>s. The same protocol was performed with the left hand. For the current analysis, we used average values of the two hands; unless the value from only one hand was available (n=233). Sex- and age-specific quintiles of GS were generated for analyses (Supplementary Table 1).  Adiposity measures Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing measured weight (kg) by measured height squared (m2). Waist circumference (WC) was measured by a tape measure at the level of the umbilicus. For the present analyses, BMI (kg<U+2009>m-2) was categorised as normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9), obesity class I (30.0–34.9) and obesity class II (<U+2A7E>35.0). A total of 62 men and 373 women who were underweight (BMI<18.5 kg<U+2009>m-2) were excluded from the analyses because of small sample size. Three categories of WC were generated according to the following sex-specific cut points: <U+2A7D>79.9<U+2009>cm, 80.0–87.9<U+2009>cm and <U+2A7E>88.0<U+2009>cm for women, and <U+2A7D>93.9<U+2009>cm, 94.0–101.9<U+2009>cm and <U+2A7E>102.0<U+2009>cm for men.22  Physical activity outcomes Accelerometer data collection An invitation to participate in the PA sub-study was emailed between February 2013 and December 2015 to 236<U+2009>519 participants who had given a valid email address upon recruitment. Participants in the North West region who had been involved in other sub-studies were not invited for accelerometer measurement due to the potential participant burden. Enclosed in an envelope, a tri-axial accelerometer (Axivity AX3, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK23) configured to capture three-dimensional acceleration at 100<U+2009>Hz with a dynamic range of ±8<U+2009>g was mailed, along with instructions on proper use of the device, to consenting participants, who were asked to start wearing the monitor on the dominant wrist (defined as the hand that participants typically use to write) upon receipt and for the next 7 days. Devices were programmed to start and finish recording at pre-specified times. Participants were requested to send the monitor back to the co-ordinating centre in a provided pre-paid envelope at the end of the 7-day monitoring period.  Accelerometer data processing Raw accelerometry data were calibrated to local gravity (1<U+2009>g) with temperature compensation17 and filtered to dampen machine noise using a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20<U+2009>Hz. Euclidean Norm Minus One was calculated as the Euclidean Norm (vector magnitude) of the acceleration in three axes minus one gravitational unit (1<U+2009>g), with any negative values truncated to zero. Non-wear was identified as time periods of <U+2A7E>60<U+2009>min where standard deviations of all three axes were <13.0<U+2009>milli-g (1<U+2009>milli-g=0.001<U+2009>g). Overall PA volume (average Euclidean Norm Minus One) and intensity distribution (5-sec resolution) were summarised for each individual activity record, while minimising diurnal bias caused by non-wear.24 Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was defined as Euclidean Norm Minus One values greater than 125<U+2009>milli-g, and expressed in min<U+2009>day-1. Participants with <72<U+2009>h of wear time or Euclidean Norm Minus One <U+2A7E>500<U+2009>milli-g were excluded from the analysis. Previous research found wrist-worn accelerometry to be valid for assessing PA intensity25 and energy expenditure.18, 26  Covariates We included the following variables as covariates in the analysis: age, ethnicity (White, mixed, Asian/Asian British, Black/Black British, others), smoking status (never, previous, current), alcohol consumption (never, previous, currently <3 times/week, currently <U+2A7E>3 times/week), employment (unemployed and employed), Townsend Area Deprivation Index (a composite score of employment, car ownership, home ownership and household overcrowding, with higher values indicating a given area’s higher degree of deprivation), severe medical conditions (any of heart attack/stroke/cancer), follow-up time (between baseline assessment and accelerometry measurement), monitor wear time (hours/day), season of accelerometer wear (two orthogonal sine functions), TV time (60-min increments) and baseline self-reported MVPA (min per day). Self-reported MVPA time was calculated as the sum of walking time, non-walking moderate (frequency × duration), and vigorous (frequency × duration) activity time, all of which were reported through questions adapted from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.27  Statistical analyses Characteristics of the participants at baseline were summarised by sex and BMI category. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the associations of adiposity and GS with the two PA outcomes of average acceleration and MVPA. First, models were fit to estimate associations of adiposity (BMI and WC) with PA, with adjustment for age (Model 1). Remaining aforementioned covariates were additionally adjusted for in subsequent models (Model 2), and finally GS was added (Model 3). A parallel series of models using GS as the primary exposure variable were fit with adjustment for age (Model 1) and additional adjustment for remaining covariates (Model 2), with final adjustment for BMI (Model 3). The GS-activity associations were also estimated, stratified by BMI or WC category, and in parallel the adiposity-activity associations were estimated, stratified by GS quintile (all adjusted for the same covariates as in Model 3); interactions between each exposure and the stratification variable were tested using a multiplication term. All exposure variables were standardised for each sex to facilitate comparison of the strength of association found for different exposures with the same outcome variable. The two PA outcome variables were log-transformed, as the models using untransformed outcome variables did not meet assumptions of normality and heteroscedasticity of residuals. Adjusted means of acceleration and MVPA time for each GS quintile and adiposity category were estimated using marginal effects from the regression analysis. All analyses were performed for men and women, separately. ...Analyses were performed in Stata/SE Version 14 for Windows (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Analyses were performed in 2016.  Code availability Codes used for processing accelerometer data are provided elsewhere.28""",see methods,"""Statistical analyses Baseline characteristics were analysed in men and women separately, reporting mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) for continuous variables and number (percent) for categorical variables, and testing for differences between the cohort with and without a previous fragility fracture.  We explored associations between previous fracture/fragility fracture and (i) hospital admission for ischaemic heart disease, (ii) hospital admission for acute myocardial infarction or (iii) hospital admission for angina, using Cox proportional hazards models, with results expressed as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). In further analyses, we explored the associations between previous fragility fracture and hospital admission for either ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction or angina using competing-risk regression models, with death from any cause as competing risk event. We used a similar approach to investigate associations between previous fragility fracture and risk of death due to ischaemic heart disease, accounting for risk of death from any other cause. Competing hazard models generate sub-hazard ratios (SHRs) instead of hazard ratios and treat death from any cause as competing risk as participants who experience this event cannot have a subsequent outcome, unlike those who are lost at follow-up (censored). The interpretation of SHR is similar to the HR of a Cox regression, with estimates higher than 1 indicating an increased risk of the outcome controlling for the fact that the competing risk events can also occur. Results from both approaches are reported firstly adjusted for age, and then adjusted for age, BMI, smoking, alcohol, educational level, physical activity, SBP, medications for hypercholesterolaemia/diabetes, calcium and vitamin D use, ankle spacing width, heel BUA and HRT (women).

These findings could have important public health implications, as grip strength in comparison with other physical measures, specifically cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity, is easily measured, cheap, and highly reproducible in clinical practice.27 We found that grip strength had a stronger association with all cause and cardiovascular disease mortality than do systolic blood pressure or total physical activity, and that the strength of associations for grip strength with incidence of cardiovascular disease was similar to that for systolic blood pressure and stronger than for total physical activity.

Each participant was asked to sit upright on a chair with their forearm on the armrest, and then grasp the handle of the device in their right hand. They were required to maintain a 90° angle of their elbow adjacent to their side so that their thumb would face upwards, while squeezing the handle as strongly as possible for ~3<U+2009>s. The same protocol was performed with the left hand. For the current analysis, we used average values of the two hands; unless the value from only one hand was available (n=233).

For the present analyses, BMI (kg<U+2009>m-2) was categorised as normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9), obesity class I (30.0–34.9) and obesity class II (<U+2A7E>35.0). A total of 62 men and 373 women who were underweight (BMI<18.5 kg<U+2009>m-2) were excluded from the analyses because of small sample size. Three categories of WC were generated according to the following sex-specific cut points: <U+2A7D>79.9<U+2009>cm, 80.0–87.9<U+2009>cm and <U+2A7E>88.0<U+2009>cm for women, and <U+2A7D>93.9<U+2009>cm, 94.0–101.9<U+2009>cm and <U+2A7E>102.0<U+2009>cm for men.22""",,,,

Participants in the North West region who had been involved in other sub-studies were not invited for accelerometer measurement due to the potential participant burden. Enclosed in an envelope, a tri-axial accelerometer (Axivity AX3, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK23) configured to capture three-dimensional acceleration at 100<U+2009>Hz with a dynamic range of ±8<U+2009>g was mailed, along with instructions on proper use of the device, to consenting participants, who were asked to start wearing the monitor on the dominant wrist (defined as the hand that participants typically use to write) upon receipt and for the next 7 days. Devices were programmed to start and finish recording at pre-specified times. Participants were requested to send the monitor back to the co-ordinating centre in a provided pre-paid envelope at the end of the 7-day monitoring period.  Accelerometer data processing Raw accelerometry data were calibrated to local gravity (1<U+2009>g) with temperature compensation17 and filtered to dampen machine noise using a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20<U+2009>Hz. Euclidean Norm Minus One was calculated as the Euclidean Norm (vector magnitude) of the acceleration in three axes minus one gravitational unit (1<U+2009>g), with any negative values truncated to zero. Non-wear was identified as time periods of <U+2A7E>60<U+2009>min where standard deviations of all three axes were <13.0<U+2009>milli-g (1<U+2009>milli-g=0.001<U+2009>g). Overall PA volume (average Euclidean Norm Minus One) and intensity distribution (5-sec resolution) were summarised for each individual activity record, while minimising diurnal bias caused by non-wear.24 Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was defined as Euclidean Norm Minus One values greater than 125<U+2009>milli-g, and expressed in min<U+2009>day-1. Participants with <72<U+2009>h of wear time or Euclidean Norm Minus One <U+2A7E>500<U+2009>milli-g were excluded from the analysis. Previous research found wrist-worn accelerometry to be valid for assessing PA intensity25 and energy expenditure.18, 26""","""Ascertainment of outcomes""","""Ascertainment of outcomes Information on incident hospital admission for ischaemic heart disease (IHD I20-I25) and for acute myocardial infarction (I21) or angina (I20, which includes both unstable and stable angina) was obtained through linkage to UK Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). The remaining ICD10 codes included the following: subsequent myocardial infarction within 4 weeks after a first event, complications of myocardial infarction, other acute ischaemic heart disease and chronic ischaemic heart disease. HES data are produced through coding and central reporting of diagnoses underlying hospital admissions nationwide. All study subjects were followed up until any ischaemic cardiovascular event, death or until 29th February 2016, yielding a mean follow-up time of 7 years and a maximum time of 10 years.""",,
