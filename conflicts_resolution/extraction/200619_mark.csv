The addition of handgrip strength improved the prediction ability, based on C index change, of an office based risk score (age, sex, diabetes diagnosed, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and smoking) for all cause (0.013) and cardiovascular mortality (0.012) and incidence of cardiovascular disease (0.009).  Conclusion Higher grip strength was associated with a range of health outcomes and improved prediction of an office based risk score. Further work on the use of grip strength in risk scores or risk screening is needed to establish its potential clinical utility.""",,Yes,""" Introduction The main role of skeletal muscle is to control body movements through the generation of force. Skeletal muscle is also the primary protein store within the body and in chronic conditions, such as cancer, and it can provide gluconeogenic precursors that are crucial for survival as such conditions progress.1 In addition to this, skeletal muscle is the primary outlet for glucose disposal in the body and is therefore important in metabolic conditions such as diabetes.2 Muscle mass is also decreased (cachexia) in many conditions, such as cancer, respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, and chronic infection and sepsis.3 With these broad physiological and functional roles, skeletal muscle has a critical, but often underrated, role in health.4  Many studies have shown that lower muscle function is associated with greater mortality and morbidity.567891011121314 For example, in 1<U+2009>142<U+2009>599 male adolescents (age 16-19 years) followed up over 24 years, low muscle strength was associated with higher all cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease but not from cancer.8 Recent data from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study (n=139<U+2009>691 adults aged 35-70 years followed up for four years) showed that grip strength was inversely associated with all cause mortality and with non-cardiovascular and cardiovascular mortality, but no significant association was found with respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.7 Moreover, lower grip strength was found to be positively associated with incident cancer in high income countries but not in middle or lower income countries. The authors of this study concluded that, although some data support an association between grip strength and mortality, further research is needed to confirm this association with other health outcomes.7  Therefore, clear evidence shows that low grip strength is associated with a range of poorer health outcomes.567891011121314 Furthermore, grip strength enhances prediction of mortality based on age (C index increase from 0.65 for age to 0.69 for age+grip strength) and sex (C index increase from 0.54 for sex to 0.63 for sex+grip).14 However, whether the addition of handgrip strength to a traditional office based risk score (including age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, presence of diabetes, and body mass index15) improves risk prediction is unclear. Such analysis will allow us to determine whether measurement of grip strength has clinical utility for risk prediction in settings where blood based measures are not readily available (for example, community/rural settings or low/middle income countries).  A meta-analysis (53<U+2009>476 participants) published in 2010 showed that grip strength was associated with lower all cause mortality; the association seemed to be weaker in studies in which participants had an average age of 60 years or less, relative to those with a higher average age at baseline.6 The relatively small sample size in this analysis limited the ability to fully explore how associations vary with age.

Methods Between April 2007 and December 2010, UK Biobank recruited 502<U+2009>628 participants (5.5% response rate after invitation letters sent to around 9 million people), aged 40-69 years, from the general population.16 Participants attended one of 22 assessment centres across England, Wales, and Scotland,1718 where they completed a touch screen questionnaire, had physical measurements taken, and provided biological samples, as described in detail elsewhere.1718 The outcomes in the study reported here were incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease, all respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, all cancers, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer, as well as all cause mortality, with the exposure variable being grip strength (age and sex specific quarters and 5 kg increase in grip strength). We treated sociodemographic factors (age, sex, ethnicity, and area based socioeconomic status), month of recruitment, smoking status, height, body mass index, and self reported physical activity, sedentary time, and dietary intake as potential confounders, as well as prevalent diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, cancer, and longstanding illness at baseline (where participants with these conditions were not excluded from the analyses).  Procedures Date of death and date and cause of hospital admissions were identified as described previously.19 We defined incident cardiovascular disease as a hospital admission or death with ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes I60, I61, I63, I64, I21, I21.4, and I21.9. We defined respiratory disease as ICD-10 codes J09-J98 and I26-I27 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as ICD-10 code J44. We defined all cause cancer as an ICD-10 code of C0.0-C9.9, D3.7-9, or D4.0-8 recorded on the cancer registry, death certificate, or hospital admission. We defined cause specific cancers by using the following ICD-10 codes recorded on the cancer registry, death certificate, or hospital admission: breast cancer (C50), prostate cancer (C61), lung cancer (C34), and colorectal cancer (C18, C19, and C20).  Grip strength was measured as previously described,19 and the mean of the right and left values was expressed in absolute units (kg) for subsequent analysis. Physical activity was based on self report, using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form,20 and total physical activity was calculated as the sum of walking and moderate and vigorous activity, measured as metabolic equivalents (MET-min/week). We derived total time spent in sedentary behaviours from the sum of self reported time spent driving, using a computer, and watching television.  Dietary information was collected via the Oxford WebQ, a web based 24 hour recall questionnaire that was developed specifically for use in large population studies.2122 We derived area based socioeconomic status from the postcode of residence, using the Townsend score.23 We calculated age from dates of birth and baseline assessment. We categorised smoking status into never, former, and current smoking. We collected medical history (physicianís diagnosis of depression, stroke, angina, heart attack, hypertension, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or longstanding illness) from the self completed baseline assessment questionnaire. Trained nurses measured height and body weight during the initial assessment centre visit. We calculated body mass index as weight/height2 and used the World Health Organizationís criteria to classify it into categories of underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5 to <25), overweight (25 to <30), obese (30 to <35), obesity class 2 (35 to <40), and obesity class 3 (=40). Trained nurses measured body composition (body fat and fat free mass) by using bio-impedance. Further details of these measurements can be found in the UK Biobankís online protocol (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk).  Statistical analyses We used multivariable cubic regression splines to visually explore non-linear associations between grip strength and health outcomes. As we found no evidence of deviation from linearity, we investigated the associations of grip strength with cause specific incidence and mortality over follow-up with Cox proportional hazard models. We reported the results as hazard ratios together with 95% confidence intervals. The models for incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer excluded participants with a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, or stroke), respiratory disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cancer at baseline, respectively.  Firstly, we treated grip strength as a continuous variable and calculated hazard ratios per 5 kg decrement in grip strength for men and women separately. To enable comparability with other reports in the literature, we also calculated hazard ratios for age and sex specific quarters of grip strength (supplementary table A), with participants in the highest quarter for grip strength used as the reference group. We also did analyses using a sex specific cut-off point for clinically relevant muscle weakness (supplementary table B), as recommended by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Sarcopenia Project.24 We investigated potential sex interactions by fitting a multiplicative interaction term into the models between grip strength (kg) and sex; although we found no significant interactions for the effect of grip strength on health outcomes by sex, we have presented stratified analyses because levels of grip strength differ significantly between woman and men (supplementary table C).  For Cox proportional hazard analyses, we ran four models that included an increasing number of covariates: model 0 (minimally adjusted) included sociodemographic covariates (age, sex, ethnicity, Townsend index, and month of recruitment); model 1 was adjusted as in model 0 but also included height; model 2 was adjusted as in model 1 but also included prevalent morbidity (hypertension, diabetes, depression, and longstanding illness, as well as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cancer when these were not the outcome); model 3 (fully adjusted) was adjusted as in model 2 but also included lifestyle factors (smoking status, body mass index categories, total physical activity, total sedentary time, and dietary intake of alcohol, fruit and vegetables, oily fish, red meat, and processed meat)....  We then investigated whether these associations differed by age by doing a two way interaction analysis and fitting a handgrip strength*age interaction term to our model. We then repeated our Cox proportional hazard analyses (models 3 and 4) stratified by age categories (=55, 56-65, and >65 years). ...

Of various genetic, biological, behavioural and environmental factors influencing PA, adiposity was found to be inversely associated with PA in previous cross-sectional studies.5, 6, 7, 8 Some longitudinal studies reported that higher adiposity levels at baseline were associated with lower PA levels at follow-up.9, 10, 11, 12  In addition to adiposity, grip strength (GS), as a proxy measure for overall muscle strength,13 has been known to be a correlate of PA.8, 14, 15 The longer-term relationship between GS and self-report PA has been examined in one previous longitudinal study.16 In fact, all but one10 prior longitudinal studies9, 11, 12, 16 in this area of research employed self-report methods to quantify PA, which are more susceptible to measurement errors compared with the objective measures of PA, such as accelerometers. Accelerometers provide more accurate estimates of PA,17, 18 thereby making it easier to disentangle the true associations between PA, adiposity and GS. Moreover, there has been no longitudinal investigation to examine the interplay of adiposity and GS relative to objectively assessed PA. Future PA may be more dependent upon baseline adiposity than strength or vice versa. Hence, it is critical from both epidemiological and public health perspectives to understand the relative contribution of adiposity and GS to PA, in order to promote physically active lifestyles.

Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the associations of adiposity and GS with the two PA outcomes of average acceleration and MVPA. First, models were fit to estimate associations of adiposity (BMI and WC) with PA, with adjustment for age (Model 1). Remaining aforementioned covariates were additionally adjusted for in subsequent models (Model 2), and finally GS was added (Model 3). A parallel series of models using GS as the primary exposure variable were fit with adjustment for age (Model 1) and additional adjustment for remaining covariates (Model 2), with final adjustment for BMI (Model 3). The GS-activity associations were also estimated, stratified by BMI or WC category, and in parallel the adiposity-activity associations were estimated, stratified by GS quintile (all adjusted for the same covariates as in Model 3); interactions between each exposure and the stratification variable were tested using a multiplication term. All exposure variables were standardised for each sex to facilitate comparison of the strength of association found for different exposures with the same outcome variable. The two PA outcome variables were log-transformed, as the models using untransformed outcome variables did not meet assumptions of normality and heteroscedasticity of residuals.

This study aimed to determine longitudinal associations of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and grip strength (GS) with objectively measured PA.  Subjects/Methods: Data are from the UK Biobank study. At baseline (2006ñ2010), BMI, WC and GS were objectively measured. At follow-up (2013ñ2015), a sub-sample of 93<U+2009>015 participants (52<U+2009>161 women) wore a tri-axial accelerometer on the dominant wrist for 7 days. Linear regression was performed to investigate longitudinal associations of standardised BMI, WC and GS at baseline with moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and acceleration after a median 5.7-years follow-up (interquartile range: 4.9ñ6.5 years).  Results: Linear regression revealed strong inverse associations for BMI and WC, and positive associations for GS with follow-up PA; in women, MVPA ranges from lowest to highest quintiles of GS were 42ñ48<U+2009>min<U+2009>day-1 in severely obese (BMI<U+2A7E>35<U+2009>kg<U+2009>m-2), 52ñ57<U+2009>min<U+2009>day-1 in obese (30<U+2A7D>BMI<35<U+2009>kg<U+2009>m-2), 61ñ65<U+2009>min<U+2009>day-1 in overweight (25<U+2A7D>BMI<30<U+2009>kg<U+2009>m-2) and 69ñ75<U+2009>min<U+2009>day-1 in normal weight (18.5<U+2A7D>BMI<25<U+2009>kg<U+2009>m-2). Follow-up MVPA was also lower in the lowest GS quintile (42ñ69<U+2009>min<U+2009>day-1) compared with the highest GS quintile (48ñ75<U+2009>min<U+2009>day-1) across BMI categories in women. The pattern of these associations was generally consistent for men, and in analyses using WC and mean acceleration as exposure and outcome, respectively.  Conclusions: More pronounced obesity and poor strength at baseline independently predict lower activity levels at follow-up.

Of various genetic, biological, behavioural and environmental factors influencing PA, adiposity was found to be inversely associated with PA in previous cross-sectional studies.5, 6, 7, 8 Some longitudinal studies reported that higher adiposity levels at baseline were associated with lower PA levels at follow-up.9, 10, 11, 12  In addition to adiposity, grip strength (GS), as a proxy measure for overall muscle strength,13 has been known to be a correlate of PA.8, 14, 15 The longer-term relationship between GS and self-report PA has been examined in one previous longitudinal study.16 In fact, all but one10 prior longitudinal studies9, 11, 12, 16 in this area of research employed self-report methods to quantify PA, which are more susceptible to measurement errors compared with the objective measures of PA, such as accelerometers. Accelerometers provide more accurate estimates of PA,17, 18 thereby making it easier to disentangle the true associations between PA, adiposity and GS. Moreover, there has been no longitudinal investigation to examine the interplay of adiposity and GS relative to objectively assessed PA. Future PA may be more dependent upon baseline adiposity than strength or vice versa. Hence, it is critical from both epidemiological and public health perspectives to understand the relative contribution of adiposity and GS to PA, in order to promote physically active lifestyles. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the independent and joint longitudinal associations of adiposity and GS with objectively measured PA in middle-aged and older adults participating in a large-scale prospective cohort.  Methods Study design and participants This study uses data collected from the UK Biobank study, which is an ongoing national cohort study of >500<U+2009>000 UK adults aged 40ñ69 years at recruitment. The inclusion criteria included living <25 miles away from one of 22 assessment centres across the UK and being registered with the National Health Service. Each participant underwent baseline measurements between 2006 and 2010 collecting a comprehensive series of genetic, behavioural and biological variables, including measurements of body composition and GS. Several years later (2013ñ2015), 103<U+2009>720 of the cohort participated in a sub-study in which their PA was objectively measured by wrist accelerometry.19 More detailed descriptions about the rationales and methodology of the UK Biobank project are provided elsewhere.20 Each participant signed informed consent before participation. The UK Biobank protocol was approved by the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee.  Exposures Grip strength (GS) GS was assessed once in each hand using a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Jamar J00105, Lafayette, IN, USA), which can measure isometric grip force up to 90<U+2009>kilograms. The device has good reliability and reproducibility.21 Staff calibrated the device at the start of each measurement day. Each participant was asked to sit upright on a chair with their forearm on the armrest, and then grasp the handle of the device in their right hand. They were required to maintain a 90∞ angle of their elbow adjacent to their side so that their thumb would face upwards, while squeezing the handle as strongly as possible for ~3<U+2009>s. The same protocol was performed with the left hand. For the current analysis, we used average values of the two hands; unless the value from only one hand was available (n=233). Sex- and age-specific quintiles of GS were generated for analyses (Supplementary Table 1).  Adiposity measures Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing measured weight (kg) by measured height squared (m2). Waist circumference (WC) was measured by a tape measure at the level of the umbilicus. For the present analyses, BMI (kg<U+2009>m-2) was categorised as normal weight (18.5ñ24.9), overweight (25.0ñ29.9), obesity class I (30.0ñ34.9) and obesity class II (<U+2A7E>35.0). A total of 62 men and 373 women who were underweight (BMI<18.5 kg<U+2009>m-2) were excluded from the analyses because of small sample size. Three categories of WC were generated according to the following sex-specific cut points: <U+2A7D>79.9<U+2009>cm, 80.0ñ87.9<U+2009>cm and <U+2A7E>88.0<U+2009>cm for women, and <U+2A7D>93.9<U+2009>cm, 94.0ñ101.9<U+2009>cm and <U+2A7E>102.0<U+2009>cm for men.22  Physical activity outcomes Accelerometer data collection An invitation to participate in the PA sub-study was emailed between February 2013 and December 2015 to 236<U+2009>519 participants who had given a valid email address upon recruitment. Participants in the North West region who had been involved in other sub-studies were not invited for accelerometer measurement due to the potential participant burden. Enclosed in an envelope, a tri-axial accelerometer (Axivity AX3, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK23) configured to capture three-dimensional acceleration at 100<U+2009>Hz with a dynamic range of ±8<U+2009>g was mailed, along with instructions on proper use of the device, to consenting participants, who were asked to start wearing the monitor on the dominant wrist (defined as the hand that participants typically use to write) upon receipt and for the next 7 days. Devices were programmed to start and finish recording at pre-specified times. Participants were requested to send the monitor back to the co-ordinating centre in a provided pre-paid envelope at the end of the 7-day monitoring period.  Accelerometer data processing Raw accelerometry data were calibrated to local gravity (1<U+2009>g) with temperature compensation17 and filtered to dampen machine noise using a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20<U+2009>Hz. Euclidean Norm Minus One was calculated as the Euclidean Norm (vector magnitude) of the acceleration in three axes minus one gravitational unit (1<U+2009>g), with any negative values truncated to zero. Non-wear was identified as time periods of <U+2A7E>60<U+2009>min where standard deviations of all three axes were <13.0<U+2009>milli-g (1<U+2009>milli-g=0.001<U+2009>g). Overall PA volume (average Euclidean Norm Minus One) and intensity distribution (5-sec resolution) were summarised for each individual activity record, while minimising diurnal bias caused by non-wear.24 Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was defined as Euclidean Norm Minus One values greater than 125<U+2009>milli-g, and expressed in min<U+2009>day-1. Participants with <72<U+2009>h of wear time or Euclidean Norm Minus One <U+2A7E>500<U+2009>milli-g were excluded from the analysis. Previous research found wrist-worn accelerometry to be valid for assessing PA intensity25 and energy expenditure.18, 26  Covariates We included the following variables as covariates in the analysis: age, ethnicity (White, mixed, Asian/Asian British, Black/Black British, others), smoking status (never, previous, current), alcohol consumption (never, previous, currently <3 times/week, currently <U+2A7E>3 times/week), employment (unemployed and employed), Townsend Area Deprivation Index (a composite score of employment, car ownership, home ownership and household overcrowding, with higher values indicating a given areaís higher degree of deprivation), severe medical conditions (any of heart attack/stroke/cancer), follow-up time (between baseline assessment and accelerometry measurement), monitor wear time (hours/day), season of accelerometer wear (two orthogonal sine functions), TV time (60-min increments) and baseline self-reported MVPA (min per day). Self-reported MVPA time was calculated as the sum of walking time, non-walking moderate (frequency ◊ duration), and vigorous (frequency ◊ duration) activity time, all of which were reported through questions adapted from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.27  Statistical analyses Characteristics of the participants at baseline were summarised by sex and BMI category. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the associations of adiposity and GS with the two PA outcomes of average acceleration and MVPA. First, models were fit to estimate associations of adiposity (BMI and WC) with PA, with adjustment for age (Model 1). Remaining aforementioned covariates were additionally adjusted for in subsequent models (Model 2), and finally GS was added (Model 3). A parallel series of models using GS as the primary exposure variable were fit with adjustment for age (Model 1) and additional adjustment for remaining covariates (Model 2), with final adjustment for BMI (Model 3). The GS-activity associations were also estimated, stratified by BMI or WC category, and in parallel the adiposity-activity associations were estimated, stratified by GS quintile (all adjusted for the same covariates as in Model 3); interactions between each exposure and the stratification variable were tested using a multiplication term. All exposure variables were standardised for each sex to facilitate comparison of the strength of association found for different exposures with the same outcome variable. The two PA outcome variables were log-transformed, as the models using untransformed outcome variables did not meet assumptions of normality and heteroscedasticity of residuals. Adjusted means of acceleration and MVPA time for each GS quintile and adiposity category were estimated using marginal effects from the regression analysis. All analyses were performed for men and women, separately. ...Analyses were performed in Stata/SE Version 14 for Windows (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Analyses were performed in 2016.

Methods UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort comprising 502,637 men and women aged 40ñ69 years, with detailed baseline assessment. History of fracture was self-reported, and details of hospital admissions for ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (ICD-10:I20-I25) were obtained through linkage to UK Hospital Episode Statistics. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the prospective relationships between prior fracture and hospital admission for men and women, controlling for age, BMI, smoking, alcohol, educational level, physical activity, systolic blood pressure, calcium and vitamin D use, ankle spacing-width, heel BUA and HRT use (women).""",,Yes,"""Results Amongst men, a fragility fracture (hip, spine, wrist or arm fracture resulting from a simple fall) within the previous 5 years was associated with a 35% increased risk of IHD admission (fully adjusted HR 1.35; 95%CI 1.00, 1.82; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.047), with the relationship predominantly driven by wrist fractures. Associations with hospitalisation for angina in men were similar in age-adjusted models [HR1.54; 95%CI: 1.03, 2.30), p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.037], but did not remain statistical significant after full adjustment [HR 1.64; 95%CI: 0.88, 3.07); p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.121]. HRs for admission with angina were lower in women, and neither age- nor fully adjusted relationships attained statistical significance.

Studies have suggested links between osteoporosis and CVD, and low bone mineral density has been associated with increased aortic calcification [3,4,5], risk of cardiovascular events and premature death [3]. Several studies have shown that CVD and vascular calcification are associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and greater risk of fractures [6, 7]. Indeed, a diagnosis of CVD, whether ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke or peripheral arterial disease, has been shown to be related to the subsequent risk of osteoporotic fracture (mostly of the hip), although the exact mechanism remains unclear [8,9,10,11]. Several studies have documented associations between chronic inflammation, osteoporosis [12, 13] and cardiovascular disease [14], together with other conditions such as sarcopenia [15], diabetes/obesity [16] and dementia [17], suggesting one possible common mechanism. However, there is also evidence that risk factors for fracture and ischaemic heart disease overlap considerably [18, 19].

Competing hazard models generate sub-hazard ratios (SHRs) instead of hazard ratios and treat death from any cause as competing risk as participants who experience this event cannot have a subsequent outcome, unlike those who are lost at follow-up (censored). The interpretation of SHR is similar to the HR of a Cox regression, with estimates higher than 1 indicating an increased risk of the outcome controlling for the fact that the competing risk events can also occur.

Coffee is also the main source of dietary caffeine which has demonstrated conflicting findings with respect to breast cancer risk in previous studies [11]. A recent meta-analysis suggested a weak association of coffee and caffeine intake with breast cancer risk for postmenopausal women [12]. Enzymes involved in metabolism of caffeine are involved in estrogen metabolism and circulating estrogens are known to increase the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer [13,14,15,16]. A previous report found that higher consumption of caffeine was associated with higher urinary concentrations of 16a-hydroxyestrone and 16-epiestriol and a decreased ratio of parent estrogens to metabolites in premenopausal women [5]. In this study, coffee consumption was positively associated with 2-hydroxyestradiol and 2-hydroxyestrone, but there were no associations observed with decaffeinated coffee [5]. Another study found a positive association of coffee and caffeine intake with sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in postmenopausal women, suggesting another potential mechanism by which coffee may reduce the levels of circulating estrogens and subsequently the risk of malignancies [6].

Enzymes involved in metabolism of caffeine are involved in estrogen metabolism and circulating estrogens are known to increase the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer [13,14,15,16]. A previous report found that higher consumption of caffeine was associated with higher urinary concentrations of 16a-hydroxyestrone and 16-epiestriol and a decreased ratio of parent estrogens to metabolites in premenopausal women [5]. In this study, coffee consumption was positively associated with 2-hydroxyestradiol and 2-hydroxyestrone, but there were no associations observed with decaffeinated coffee [5]. Another study found a positive association of coffee and caffeine intake with sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in postmenopausal women, suggesting another potential mechanism by which coffee may reduce the levels of circulating estrogens and subsequently the risk of malignancies [6]. In addition, previous studies suggested that activity of several enzymes, including those involved in estrogen and xenobiotic metabolism, could be altered by coffee consumption [8].""",Yes,"""Postmenopausal hormones have been consistently shown to increase breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women [17]. Given noted effects of caffeine on endogenous hormone metabolism described above, it is possible that the effect of coffee on breast cancer is modified by womenís use of hormones after menopause.
