Ander2018ysis.022,Red and processed meat consumption and breast cancer: UK Biobank cohort study and meta-analysis,KD,Cohort,,ni,,,,ni,,,Never,yes_exact,"""This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource""",No,No,,,Yes,"""Aim Red and processed meat may be risk factors for breast cancer due to their iron content, administration of oestrogens to cattle or mutagens created during cooking. We studied the associations in UK Biobank and then included the results in a meta-analysis of published cohort studies.  Methods UK Biobank, a general population cohort study, recruited participants aged 40–69 years. Incident breast cancer was ascertained via linkage to routine hospital admission, cancer registry and death certificate data. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to explore the associations between red and processed meat consumption and breast cancer. Previously published cohort studies were identified from a systematic review using PubMed and Ovid and a meta-analysis conducted using a random effects model.""",Yes,"""Results Over a median of 7 years follow-up, 4819 of the 262,195 women developed breast cancer. The risk was increased in the highest tertile (>9 g/day) of processed meat consumption (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.35, p = 0.001). Collation with 10 previous cohort studies provided data on 40,257 incident breast cancers in 1.65 million women. On meta-analysis, processed meat consumption was associated with overall (relative risk [RR] 1.06, 95% CI 1.01–1.11) and post-menopausal (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03–1.15), but not pre-menopausal (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88–1.10), breast cancer. In UK Biobank and the meta-analysis, red meat consumption was not associated with breast cancer (adjusted HR 0.99 95% CI 0.88–1.12 and RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99–1.08, respectively).  Conclusions Consumption of processed meat, but not red meat, may increase the risk of breast cancer.""",Partially,"Very short ""In the United Kingdom, 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer [1], but more than one-quarter of cases could be prevented by reduced exposure to exogenous oestrogens, reduced obesity, increased physical activity and breastfeeding [1]. There is a lack of consensus on whether red and processed meat consumption is a risk factor for breast cancer [2]. Four meta-analyses have produced conflicting results [3], [4], [5], [6] due to wide inclusion criteria, resulting in the inclusion of very heterogeneous studies.

The aim of the study was to compare the performance of different muscle mass measures for predicting incident osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.  Methods This study included data from 149 166 participants (aged 60.3 ± 5.5 years) as part of the UK Biobank cohort. Body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance. The muscle mass measures included were total body skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and appendicular SMM (aSMM) divided by height squared (ht2), derived residuals, SMM, SMM adjusted for body mass (SMM/bm × 100), and aSMM normalized for body mass index (aSMM/BMI). Diagnoses of the events were confirmed by primary care physicians and coded according to the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD‐10: M80‐M82).""",Yes,"""Over a median follow‐up of 6.75 (5th to 95th percentile interval, 1.53 to 8.37) years, 394 newly diagnosed cases of osteoporosis occurred, with 40 (10.2%) cases being associated with a pathological fracture. SMM/ht2, aSMM/ht2 residual, and SMM were lower in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis compared with women without (all P < 0.0001), while SMM/bm × 100 (P = 0.003), but not aSMM/BMI (P = 0.59), was higher in the osteoporosis group. The unadjusted rates of osteoporosis increased with decreasing quintiles for SMM/ht2, aSMM/ht2, residuals, and SMM (all P trend <0.0001), while the incidence of osteoporosis increased with increasing SMM/bm × 100 (P trend =0.001), but not for aSMM/BMI (P = 0.45). After minimally adjusting for age and after full adjustment, SMM/ht2, aSMM/ht2, and SMM were the only measure that consistently predicted osteoporosis in the total group of postmenopausal women [hazard ratio (HR) 0.65–0.67, all P ≤ 0.0001], in lean women (HR 0.62–0.68; all P ≤ 0.001), and women with increased adiposity (HR 0.64–0.68; all P ≤ 0.01). In fully adjusted models, the changes in the R 2 statistic were 13.4%, 11.6%, and 15.3% for the SMM/ht2 (aSMM/ht2), residual, and SMM, but only 4.9% and 1.3% for SMM/bm × 100 and aSMM/BMI.Conclusions Muscle mass measures adjusted for height only (SMM/ht2, aSMM/ht2) appear to be better muscle‐relevant risk factors for incident osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, including when stratified into lean participants and participants with increased adiposity.""  ",Yes,"""Introduction Menopause is accompanied by pronounced changes in body composition including loss of bone (osteoporosis) and muscle (sarcopenia), often in the presence of increased adiposity and fat redistribution towards central‐type obesity.1, 2, 3 Osteoporosis, a skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, predisposes to skeletal fragility and increases fracture risk.2 It is typically diagnosed on the basis of a bone mineral density (BMD) T‐score ≤ −2.5, as assessed by dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA).2 Because of its association with fractures, osteoporosis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and results in substantial burden for both individuals and healthcare systems.4 Current estimates suggest that approximately 50% of women over 50 years old are at risk of osteoporotic fractures.5 In contrast to osteoporosis, sarcopenia remains poorly defined, with lack of consensus about its operational definition.6 Nevertheless, it is especially common in postmenopausal women, with prevalence reaching up to 30% depending on the definition and population used.3 Thus far, proposed definitions are based on muscle mass alone7, 8, 9 or combined with muscle function (e.g. grip strength) and/or physical performance (e.g. gait speed).10, 11, 12, 13 Further perplexing the current debate, a number of muscle mass measures and different threshold for these measures have been suggested. These include total body or appendicular muscle mass adjusted for height only,7, 8, 11 height and fat mass,9 or body size [i.e. body mass index (BMI)13 or body mass12]. Despite the plethora of muscle mass measures, there is scarcity of data on their association with health outcomes. Some previous studies that explored the relationship between osteoporosis and sarcopenia have yielded mixed results.14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Studies are limited by small sample size,14, 15, 17, 18 or cross‐sectional design,14, 15, 16, 17, 18 making extrapolation to the general population challenging. Appendicular muscle mass adjusted for height is the most widely used measure of sarcopenia14, 15, 16, 17, 18; however, there is a lack of comparative data using other available measures of muscle mass in relation to bone health outcomes.

Participants self‐reported their age, sex, and ethnicity. Ethnicity was categorized as White or other (mixed, Asian, Black, Chinese, and other). A Townsend deprivation score was computed for all participants using information about employment, car and home ownership, and household overcrowding.20 A higher Townsend deprivation score is indicative of greater levels of an area's socio‐economic deprivation.20 Participants reported their smoking status (never, previous, or current) and their alcohol intake (never, previous, or current). Data on physical activity including frequency (number of days in a typical week that participants performed 10 min or more of walking, moderate, and vigorous physical activity) and duration (minutes spent on each activity category on a typical day) were collected by asking questions similar to those included in the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.21 For each activity category, the frequency was multiplied by the duration and the metabolic equivalent value (3.3 for walking, 4.0 for moderate physical activity, and 8.0 for vigorous physical activity), which were then summed to generate a score of metabolic equivalent minutes of physical activity per week for each participant.  Medical history and current medications Self‐reported data on medical conditions were collected at baseline by asking participants whether a doctor has diagnosed any cancer or diabetes. Participants reported if they had undergone bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy or were on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Self‐reported data on fracture occurrence (yes or no) over the past 5 years were also collected. Information on X‐ray verification was unavailable.  Quantitative heel ultrasound Quantitative ultrasound of the heel was performed using the Sahara Clinical Sonometer (Hologic, Bedford, Massachusetts) according to a standardized protocol. Trained staff checked if participants were able to undertake both left and right heel ultrasound measurement. Those with open wounds, breaks or sores around the heel, or metal parts (such as pins) in the heel did not undertake measurement of that heel. Each centre used the same machine model, and quality control was performed with a phantom on a daily basis as per manufacturer's instructions. The mean values for BMDs (g/cm2) and BMD T‐scores for the left and right heel were computed.  Anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance measurements Height was measured using the SECA 240 height measure (SECA, Hamburg, Germany). Participants removed their socks and footwear and stood flat footed with their heels against a back plate. Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a segmental body composition analyser (Tanita BC‐418MA, Tokyo, Japan). Height and weight were used to calculate BMI as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). Waist circumference was measured at the level of the umbilicus using a tape measure. All these measurements were performed by trained staff.  Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) was calculated using the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) equation published previously by Janssen and colleagues22:  SMM(kg)=[(ht2/R×0.401)+(gender×3.825)+(age×−0.071)]+5.102, where ht2 = height in centimetres squared; R = resistance in ohms; for gender, men = 1 and women = 0; and age is in years.

These findings have implications for the detection of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity in this clinically relevant population at high risk of musculoskeletal diseases. Future studies are required to investigate the association between muscle mass measures and bone health in elderly men with varying degrees of adiposity.""",No,,yes,No,,No,,No,,No,,,,,,,,,
