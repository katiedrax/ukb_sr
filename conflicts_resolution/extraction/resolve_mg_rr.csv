Economic implications of sleep disturbance cannot be overlooked and include increased absenteeism and lost productivity,13 more accidents14 and increased healthcare utilisation and costs.13 In the USA, the annual economic burden of sleep disturbance has been estimated at $100 billion,13 and the National Health Service (NHS) in England spends around £50 million on sleep medication each year.15  It is evident that nicotine can stimulate the release of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine16 which, in turn, may inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and sleep-promoting neurons located in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), causing excessive arousal of the body.17 Electroencephalography (EEG) reports have also revealed marked differences in sleep waves between smokers and non-smokers, with smokers having frequent arousals.18 There is strong evidence that smoking cessation is associated with poor sleep;19 however, previous studies on active smoking and sleep characteristics have produced conflicting results.

However, participants are not necessarily representative in terms of lifestyle. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to generalise summary statistics, such as prevalence, to the general population. However, estimates of the magnitude of associations, such as between tobacco and sleep, should be generalisable. In common with most epidemiological studies of sleep, sleep characteristics were self-reported; objective measurement of parameters such as sleep duration would, however, not be feasible within such a large study. It is also important to mention that the questions used to evaluate sleep disturbance were not from a validated scale such as the General Sleep Disturbance Scale. Smoking characteristics were also self-reported; reports of smoking status and level of exposure could not be corroborated by objective measures such as cotinine assay. Whilst we adjusted for a wide range of potential confounders, residual confounding is always possible within any observational study. For instance, we used self-reported depression and stress as a proxy for mental health and it is possible that these do not completely measure overall mental health. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders and are also associated with sleep disturbance and probably initiation of cigarette smoking, but we could not adjust for anxiety in our analysis. Additionally, since this was a cross-sectional study, it was not possible to determine the temporal relationship between smoking and sleep; therefore, reverse causation cannot be excluded. For example, sleep disturbance might lead to mental disorders such as anxiety and depression.51 There is some evidence to suggest that poor stress control and anxiety disorders are among the factors that predict initiation of cigarette smoking.52,5""",No,NA,becky,Partially,"Makes a policy suggestion despite limitations ""Tobacco exposure is known to directly increase the risk of many diseases including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and many cancers.54 Our study suggests that there is also an association between tobacco exposure and a number of sleep characteristics. If this association is causal, tobacco exposure may also be impacting on health partly via an effect on sleep. Smoking prevalence and exposure to passive smoking are declining in many developed countries. However, these improvements are more than offset by increases in highly populated, developing, and newly industrialised countries such as China. As a result, the global prevalence of active smoking and passive exposure to tobacco is expected to continue increasing over the next few decades.55 Currently, ~6 million deaths are attributed to smoking every year, of which 0.6 million are associated with passive smoke exposure.56 It may be beneficial to enforce the existing global tobacco control interventions to reduce the impact on a wide range of health parameters, including sleep disturbance""",Yes,"""The UK Biobank is representative of the UK general population, within the age range recruited, in terms of age, sex, ethnic and socioeconomic breakdown.

Models developed to identify patients at risk for EAC and increase early detection have been developed based on data from case–control studies. We analyzed data from a prospective study to identify factors available to clinicians that identify individuals with a high absolute risk of EAC.  Methods We collected data from 355,034 individuals (all older than 50 years) without a prior history of cancer enrolled in the UK Biobank prospective cohort study from 2006 through 2010; clinical data were collected through September 2014. We identified demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors, measured at baseline, that associated with development of EAC within 5 years using logistic regression analysis. We used these data to create a model to identify individuals at risk for EAC. Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity analyses.""",Yes,"""Results Within up to 5 years of follow up, 220 individuals developed EAC. Age, sex, smoking, body mass index, and history of esophageal conditions or treatments identified individuals who developed EAC (AUROC, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.77–0.82). We used these factors to develop a scoring system and identified a point cut off that 104,723 individuals (29.5%), including 170 of the 220 cases with EAC, were above. The scoring system identified individuals who developed EAC with 77.4% sensitivity and 70.5% specificity. The 5-year risk of EAC was 0.16% for individuals with scores above the threshold and 0.02% for individuals with scores below the threshold.  Conclusion We combined data on several well-established risk factors that are available to clinicians to develop a system to identify individuals with a higher absolute risk of EAC within 5 years. Studies are needed to evaluate the utility of these factors in a multi-stage, triaged, screening program.""",,Yes,"""The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is increasing in Western populations,1 and prognosis is poor. Overall survival is <20%.2 Methods to improve early diagnosis are important3 because the poor survival is largely attributable to late clinical presentation with advanced disease.2  Endoscopy with biopsies for histologic confirmation is the gold standard method of detecting esophageal and gastric cancers.4, 5 However, population-wide endoscopy screening programs are unlikely to be cost-effective or feasible because of the low incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancers and the cost, invasiveness, and psychological burden of endoscopy screening.6  Clinical guidelines suggest that individuals with chronic symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) should be referred for endoscopy screening to identify Barrett’s esophagus,7 a precursor to EAC present in 1%–2% of the adult population.8 Individuals with Barrett’s esophagus are often entered into endoscopy surveillance programs.9 Use of GERD as the sole initial triage factor for endoscopy is appealing in its simplicity, but delays in obtaining endoscopy are common in part because of a lack of both specificity, because risk of EAC in individuals with GERD is low,10, 11 and sensitivity, because a large proportion of EAC cases (~40%) never report GERD symptoms.11  Automated clinical risk prediction tools using data easily accessible to primary care physicians to flag high-risk individuals may offer a lower cost method to improve early detection and are being investigated for other conditions.12 Established risk factors including body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and GERD may be useful for risk prediction of EAC13, 14, 15 and Barrett’s esophagus.16, 17, 18 However, existing studies have relied on age and sex matched case-control data, which may be subject to recall bias and ignore age and sex in improving the risk prediction, which are strong risk factors.19 An assessment of traditional risk factors may be useful as triage directly to endoscopy, in which case risk prediction for any upper gastrointestinal cancers diagnosed via endoscopy would be most informative. However, it seems likely that EAC risk prediction will require a multi-stage screening strategy,20 of which some steps may be specific to EAC.""",,Yes,"""Automated clinical risk prediction tools using data easily accessible to primary care physicians to flag high-risk individuals may offer a lower cost method to improve early detection and are being investigated for other conditions.12 Established risk factors including body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and GERD may be useful for risk prediction of EAC13, 14, 15 and Barrett’s esophagus.16, 17, 18 However, existing studies have relied on age and sex matched case-control data, which may be subject to recall bias and ignore age and sex in improving the risk prediction, which are strong risk factors.19 An assessment of traditional risk factors may be useful as triage directly to endoscopy, in which case risk prediction for any upper gastrointestinal cancers diagnosed via endoscopy would be most informative.

IntroductionInsomnia is defined as persistent difficulties with sleep initi-ation and/or maintenance, resulting in significant impairment todaytime functioning. At the symptom level, insomnia affects up toone-third of the adult population, while persistent insomnia af-fects approximately 10e12% and is associated with increased riskfor cardiovascular disease, depression, and early mortality[1,2].Both daytime functioning and quality of life are known to beseverely affected in those with insomnia and often drive treat-ment seeking[3e5].Morespecifically, previous work shows thatthe most commonly cited areas of daytime dysfunction areproblems with fatigue, work performance, cognitive perfor-mance, and emotion regulation[6]. Insomnia has also beenassociated with a range of serious and non-serious sleep-relatedaccidents[7].While experimental sleep loss engenders reliable cognitiveimpairment, particularly for vigilance, complex attention, andworking memory[8], there has been comparatively little work oninsomnia. In general, thefield has been characterised by mixedfindings, with some studies showing impairment and othersfailing to observe differences from controls[9]. Nevertheless,meta-analytic data suggest thatpatients exhibit reliable im-pairments in tasks probing episodic memory, working memory,and  problem  solving,  with  small-to-medium  effect  sizes[10]. Recent, well-controlled studies have found evidence ofinsomnia-related impairments in switching of attention andworking memory[11], and sustained attention and episodicmemory[12].However,therecontinuestobeconflictingfindingsin the insomnia literature[13e15],andstudiesgenerallyrecruitsmall samples of patients with‘primary insomnia’,whoareotherwise healthy.Larger epidemiology-based studies of insomnia symptoms andcognitive performance similarly display mixed results: showingevidence of impairment[16], no evidence of impairment[17]orimpairment only for specific insomnia sub-groups[15,18].""",,Yes,"""To ourknowledge, no study has investigated insomnia symptoms andcognitive performance in a large population-based sample ofmiddle-aged adults, with a standardised test battery, while simul-taneously appraising the effects of other important sleep variables,including chronotype, sleep duration, and sleep medication.The present study aimed to conduct the largest investigation ofinsomnia symptoms and cognitive performance to date throughanalysis of UK Biobank data.

Sleep-related variablesand cognitive performance were assessed in a single visit thatlasted approximately 90 min.2.3. Sleep-related variablesTo assess insomnia symptoms, participants were asked‘Do youhave trouble falling asleep at night or do you wake up in themiddle of the night?’with responses‘never/rarely’,‘sometimes’and‘usually’. Participants were categorised as having frequentinsomnia symptoms if they answered‘usually’to this question,while the remaining participants made up the control groupwithout frequent insomnia symptoms. Chronotype was assessedusing the following question:‘Do you consider yourself to be’...:‘definitely a“morning”person’,‘more a“morning”than“evening”person’,‘more an“evening”than“morning”person’,‘definitely an“evening”person’. For the purposes of the present study, wecollapsed the two middle responses into an‘intermediate’chro-notype category, permitting comparisons with the‘definitelymorning’and‘definitely evening’groups. Sleep duration wasrecorded as the number of reported hours to the following ques-tion:‘About how many hours sleep do you get in every 24 h? (include naps)’. Given previously established U-shape relationshipswith health and cognition[20], we categorised sleep duration intoshort (<7 h), normal (7e9h)andlong(>9 h) based on recentguidelines[21].2.4. Cognitive performanceFive cognitive measures were administered through a compu-terised touchscreen interface[22]. Time to complete allfivecognitive tests was approximately 15 min. The tests were designedspecifically for the UK Biobank to allow administration at scalewithout examiner supervision. The tasks show evidence of an un-derlying performance factor and good stability over time, with theexception of visual memory performance, which has a compara-tively lower intraclass correlation coefficient[22]. Thefive tasks involved the following instructions:Reasoning: This task assessed the ability to solve 13 verbal andnumeric reasoning problems. Each problem hadfive possibleresponse options. The dependent variable was the total numberof correct answers given (range 0e13) within a 2-min period,with higher scores indicating better performance.Basic reaction time: This task was delivered in the style of thecard game,‘snap’, and requested participants to respond with abutton press when they detected the appearance of a matchingpair of symbols. The dependent variable was the mean responsetime in milliseconds across 12 matching-pair trials. RT valueswere log-transformed because of skewed distribution (ln x).Numeric short-term memory: In this task, a string of numberswas presented on the screen, which subsequently disappeared.Participants were then asked to enter the number string frommemory, in the reverse order, through a keypad. The dependentvariable was the maximum string length recalled correctly(range: 0e12), with higher scores indicating better perfor-mance. The test was discontinued afterfive successive incorrectresponses at string length¼2.Visual memory: In this task, six card pairs of symbols were pre-sented on-screen in a random pattern. Cards were then turnedface down on the screen, and participants were asked to locate asmany symbol pairs as possible in as few attempts as possible. Thedependent variable was the number of errors made during pairsmatching (range 0e146), which was log-transformed because ofskewed distribution and zero inflation (ln (xþ1)).Prospective memory: In this task, participants were asked toremember to perform a pre-planned instruction. Specifically, atthe beginning of the test battery, they were presented with thefollowing instruction:‘At the end of the games we will show youfour coloured symbols and ask you to touch the blue square.However, to test your memory, we want you to actually touch theorange circle instead’. If participants remembered to touch theorange circle onfirst attempt, they were coded as‘correct’(1),while those failing to do so were set to 0.2.5. Demographic dataDemographic data included age, sex, and neighbourhood-levelsocioeconomic status as measured by the Townsend index of ma-terial deprivation. For statistical analyses, socioeconomic status waslog-transformed because of skewed distribution by using an‘ln(xþ7)’equation (minimum of non-transformed index:6.26).Educational qualifications were recorded and were dichotomisedaccording to whether participants held a college/university degree.We also included body mass index (BMI) as a covariate in adjustedanalyses.2.6. Medication and clinical dataCurrent medications were self-reported to the research nurse,and the participants were dichotomised according to whether theywere taking sleep medication (sedatives and hypnotics), any otherpsychotropic medication (mood stabilisers, antidepressants, andantipsychotics) or antihypertensive medication (ACE inhibitors,angiotensin II antagonists, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers,and diuretics). Current depressive symptoms were assessed usingthe following question:‘Over the past two weeks, how often haveyou felt down, depressed or hopeless?’, with the followingresponse options:‘not at all’,‘several days’,‘more than half thedays’or‘nearly every day’. For the purpose of the present analyses,those scoring‘several days’,‘more than half the days’or‘nearlyevery day’were coded in the‘depressive symptoms’category, whilethose scoring‘not at all’were considered in the‘no depressivesymptoms’category. In addition, participants were dichotomisedaccording to whether they reported hypertension or any cardio-vascular disease.2.7. AnalysesDescriptive data presentation included mean values and stan-dard deviations and the proportion of the sample reporting specificquestionnaire response options. Questionnaire response options,‘do not know’or‘prefer not to answer’, were handled as missingvalues. For cognitive dependent variables, the sample size variedacross tests because the reasoning and prospective memory testswere added after the commencement of data collection, while thenumeric memory task was included from the outset but subse-quently removed because of time constraints.In afirst step (unadjusted analyses, model 1), the associationbetween insomnia status (those with frequent insomnia symptomsvs. those without frequent insomnia symptoms) and cognitiveperformance was analysed using four linear models, with insomniastatus as the single predictor variable and reasoning, basic reactiontime, numeric memory, and visual memory as dependent variables.The association between insomnia status and prospective memoryperformance was investigated using a logistic model. In a secondstep (model 2), age, sex, socioeconomic status, and education wereadded as covariates in the linear and logistic models described inmodel 1. In a third step (model 3), chronotype (with the interme-diate type as the reference category), sleep medication use, BMI as acontinuous variable, hypertension, antihypertensive medication,cardiovascular disease, depressive symptoms, and psychotropicmedication were added as further covariates. In afinal step (model4), sleep duration (with 7e9 h as the reference category) wasinserted as an additional predictor of cognitive performance. Wetherefore report unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted relation-ships between insomnia status and cognitive outcomes. For chro-notype, sleep duration and sleep medication, we report only thefully adjusted relationships (model 4) controlling for all de-mographic, clinical and remaining sleep variables.

Third, oursleep trait predictor variables were limited by their low resolution,reflecting just single item self-report questions. For example, oursleep duration estimate included daytime naps and therefore wecould not separate the contribution of night and daytime sleep,which may have affected group categorisation and, by extension,associations with our dependent variables of interest. We could notinvestigate subtypes of insomnia that may have unique relation-ships with cognitive impairment[16]. Specifically, we could notcategorise participants into insomnia disorder because we lackedinformation on chronicity of sleep problems, quantitative criteria(eg, minutes for sleep-onset latency and wake-time during thenight), attribution for daytime cognitive impairment or help-seeking. Greater precision around these factors and objectivesleep data may have identified sub-groups of participants withcognitive impairment[12,15,18,30,50]. Our results therefore canonly speak to frequent insomnia symptoms at the population level.Fourth, our sample age was restricted to those predominantly inthe middle age. It may be that insomnia confers the greatest risk tocognitive impairment in elderly samples[23]. Fifth, while the UKBiobank represents a large and unique resource, the recruitmentmethod and low response rate (5.5%) may have resulted in selectionbiases, potentially limiting generalisability to the broader UK pop-ulation[51]. Sixth, sample size differed across statistical modelsowing to missing data for specific covariates of interest. However,we note that when analyses were restricted to complete data acrossall models,findings remain unchanged (seeSupplementaryTable 2). Finally, our analyses were based exclusively on Gaussianlinear models, and we did not test whether nonlinear and/or non-Gaussian models would reveal more nuanced associations betweenour predictor and outcome variables""",Yes,see 19_i,partial,Yes,"""In our large UK sample, frequent insomnia symptoms were notindependently associated with cognitive impairment. Indeed,contrary to our hypotheses, we found a small statistical advantagefor those with frequent insomnia symptoms over those without,which is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. Our data in no wayundermine subjective daytime reports of those with poor sleepbecause task performance may not fully map onto daytime phe-nomenology[4,10]. We cannot exclude the possibility that thosewith insomnia disorder or discrete sub-groups of insomnia do notexhibit reliable performance impairment.

Time to complete all five cognitive tests was approximately 15 min. The tests were designed specifically for the UK Biobank to allow administration at scale without examiner supervision. The tasks show evidence of an underlying performance factor and good stability over time, with the exception of visual memory performance, which has a comparatively lower intraclass correlation coefficient [22].  The five tasks involved the following instructions: • Reasoning: This task assessed the ability to solve 13 verbal and numeric reasoning problems. Each problem had five possible response options. The dependent variable was the total number of correct answers given (range 0–13) within a 2-min period, with higher scores indicating better performance.  • Basic reaction time: This task was delivered in the style of the card game, ‘snap’, and requested participants to respond with a button press when they detected the appearance of a matching pair of symbols. The dependent variable was the mean response time in milliseconds across 12 matching-pair trials. RT values were log-transformed because of skewed distribution (ln x).  • Numeric short-term memory: In this task, a string of numbers was presented on the screen, which subsequently disappeared. Participants were then asked to enter the number string from memory, in the reverse order, through a keypad. The dependent variable was the maximum string length recalled correctly (range: 0–12), with higher scores indicating better performance. The test was discontinued after five successive incorrect responses at string length = 2.  • Visual memory: In this task, six card pairs of symbols were presented on-screen in a random pattern. Cards were then turned face down on the screen, and participants were asked to locate as many symbol pairs as possible in as few attempts as possible. The dependent variable was the number of errors made during pairs matching (range 0–146), which was log-transformed because of skewed distribution and zero inflation (ln (x + 1)).  • Prospective memory: In this task, participants were asked to remember to perform a pre-planned instruction. Specifically, at the beginning of the test battery, they were presented with the following instruction: ‘At the end of the games we will show you four coloured symbols and ask you to touch the blue square.

The association between insomnia status and prospective memory performance was investigated using a logistic model. In a second step (model 2), age, sex, socioeconomic status, and education were added as covariates in the linear and logistic models described in model 1. In a third step (model 3), chronotype (with the intermediate type as the reference category), sleep medication use, BMI as a continuous variable, hypertension, antihypertensive medication, cardiovascular disease, depressive symptoms, and psychotropic medication were added as further covariates. In a final step (model 4), sleep duration (with 7–9 h as the reference category) was inserted as an additional predictor of cognitive performance. We therefore report unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted relationships between insomnia status and cognitive outcomes.

Unadjusted analyses revealed that those with frequent insomnia symptoms displayed impairment across all cognitive tasks (except prospective memory); however, intermediate adjustment for demographic variables rendered these associations non-significant or reversed their direction. Full adjustment (model 4) for demographic, medical and sleep-related variables left those with frequent insomnia symptoms with a small but statistically significant advantage over those without insomnia for all cognitive measures (except numeric memory). However, sleep medication use and both long (>9 h) and short (<7 h) sleep durations were independently associated with cognitive impairment, while evening chronotype was associated with better task performance.""",Yes,"""Our study has several important caveats. First, this was a cross-sectional study and therefore our findings cannot elucidate causality. Second, our cognitive dependent variables were created for brief completion on large numbers of participants and hence have not undergone formal validation. In partial mitigation, principal component analyses support an expected underlying performance (g) factor across tasks, and test-retest suggests good stability for most task-dependent variables [22]. Moreover, associations with variables in the expected direction (eg, with age and education), evidence of impairment in those with psychiatric disorder [24] and associations with several genetic variants [49] provide further support of task validity. However, tasks were brief and did not parametrically manipulate cognitive load, and the battery did not sample additional domains of cognition, potentially contributing to limited sensitivity for insomnia-related impairment. Third, our sleep trait predictor variables were limited by their low resolution, reflecting just single item self-report questions. For example, our sleep duration estimate included daytime naps and therefore we could not separate the contribution of night and daytime sleep, which may have affected group categorisation and, by extension, associations with our dependent variables of interest. We could not investigate subtypes of insomnia that may have unique relationships with cognitive impairment [16]. Specifically, we could not categorise participants into insomnia disorder because we lacked information on chronicity of sleep problems, quantitative criteria (eg, minutes for sleep-onset latency and wake-time during the night), attribution for daytime cognitive impairment or help-seeking. Greater precision around these factors and objective sleep data may have identified sub-groups of participants with cognitive impairment [12], [15], [18], [30], [50]. Our results therefore can only speak to frequent insomnia symptoms at the population level. Fourth, our sample age was restricted to those predominantly in the middle age. It may be that insomnia confers the greatest risk to cognitive impairment in elderly samples [23]. Fifth, while the UK Biobank represents a large and unique resource, the recruitment method and low response rate (5.5%) may have resulted in selection biases, potentially limiting generalisability to the broader UK population [51]. Sixth, sample size differed across statistical models owing to missing data for specific covariates of interest. However, we note that when analyses were restricted to complete data across all models, findings remain unchanged (see Supplementary Table 2).

A previous study analysed the dietary intake in people consuming a reduced-carbohydrate diet (<40% calories). However, it is not clear what foods people consume when carbohydrate is reduced to below 26% of total calories. Methods: In the present cross-sectional study, the dietary and nutrient intake collected via up to five consecutive 24-h dietary recalls and a food frequency questionnaire of 444 individuals (aged 46-79 years) consuming <26% of calories from carbohydrate (LCHO) was compared with that of 131 897 individuals consuming =45% calories from carbohydrate (NCHO) using the UK Biobank Dataset.

Both LCHO groups reported consuming significantly more red meat, oily fish, nuts and seeds but fewer fruits, vegetables and pulses compared to the NCHO groups. In general, the consumption of oily fish, nuts, seeds and pulses was low across the whole cohort and differences in intake between the LCHO and NCHO groups were small. After adjusting for socio-economic status, most differences remained. Conclusions: Carbohydrate restriction is associated with both beneficial and potentially deleterious dietary changes compared to a normal carbohydrate intake.""",,Yes,"""Introduction Low-carbohydrate diets (LCHO) are becoming increasingly popular. In the UK, it was reported that 3 million people had tried the LCHO diet in 2003 1, with the Atkins diet books alone having sold over 45 million books in the latter half of the 20th century 2. Carbohydrate (CHO) restriction, where the restriction is sufficient and adhered to 3-5, appears to confer particular metabolic benefits for the management of type 2 diabetes 4, 6, including a reduction in post-prandial glycaemia. However, the long-term health effects in the wider population are not clear. This raises questions of its long-term safety and efficacy, which warrants ongoing investigation into the dietary habits of such individuals 7, 8.  It is important to note that there is no singular definition of what constitutes a LCHO diet, although a CHO content comprising <26% of calories (or <130 g CHO) has been suggested as a cut-off 9. Variations of the LCHO diet differ in their permitted levels of macronutrients, such as the low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, which emphasises the importance of increasing fat consumption 10, whereas others increase protein to a greater degree 11. Absolute intakes (i.e. additional grammes) of protein or fat may not increase at all, mirroring a low calorie diet as a result of a reduced overall intake 12. The replacing food or macronutrient may also be an important determinant of the health effects of LCHO diets 4, 7, 8. However, most of the data on food and nutrient consumption in a LCHO diet have been collected in clinical trials 5-8, where participants are instructed to follow a particular dietary pattern. Therefore, to determine nutritional adequacy, it is important to establish what free-living individuals on a CHO-restricted diet are consuming.  A recent study compared the dietary intakes of individuals consuming fewer than 40% of calories from CHO with those who were consuming =40% in the UK. Although people on a reduced-CHO diet consumed more red and processed meat and fewer fruits compared to those on a normal-CHO diet, they also consumed more oily fish and vegetables 13. Therefore, CHO restriction may be associated with both healthy and less-healthy dietary choices. A weakness of the study was the high cut-off used to define the LCHO group with the aim of generating a sufficient number of subjects from the limited data available.""",,Yes,"""A recent study compared the dietary intakes of individuals consuming fewer than 40% of calories from CHO with those who were consuming =40% in the UK.

A weakness of the study was the high cut-off used to define the LCHO group with the aim of generating a sufficient number of subjects from the limited data available. A lower boundary would be more likely to produce a group of individuals intentionally reducing their CHO intake and thus produce a more accurate representation of dietary and nutrient consumption. To identify sufficient numbers of people consuming a LCHO, a large sample size is required. The UK Biobank contains dietary and anthropometric data for more than 500 000 people.

Statistical analysis To determine differences in normally distributed dependent variables, independent t-tests were used. The Mann–Whitney U-test was used to examine differences in intake of ordinal variables. Proportions between groups were compared using chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact test where cells did not have sufficient numbers, with a Bonferroni correction being used to account for multiple comparisons. Independent t-tests were carried out to determine whether the TDI was significant between the LCHO and NCHO diets. One-way analyses of variance were carried out to determine whether the TDI was significantly different between ordinal dietary variables and bivariate correlations were carried out to determine the relationship between the TDI and continuous dietary variables. Where significant relationships were observed between the TDI and dietary intake, the dataset was split into quartiles of the TDI and the tests described above were carried out to determine whether the differences in dietary intake observed between the LCHO and NCHO diets remained in each of the quartiles.

These included an estimate of the weekly consumption (never, less than once a week, once a week, two to four times a week, more than five times a week) of red and processed meats, poultry, non-oily and oily fish, cheese and alcoholic beverages, as well as the approximate number of tablespoons of fruit or vegetables consumed per day, type of milk, bread, cereal and spread, and whether or not the individual adds salt to food.  In addition, a 24-h dietary recall was collected at baseline, as well as on four further occasions from 2009 to 2012. The average time period between recalls was 6 months. The dietary data were collected using a touchscreen Oxford WebQ online 24-h dietary recall questionnaire 20. Individuals were asked whether they ate or drank any of the approximately 200 commonly-consumed foods in the previous 24 h, as well as the amount, using incremental estimates of portion sizes (quarter of a portion, half a portion, one portion, etc.). The data were then used to estimate macro- and micronutrient intakes based on McCance and Widdowson's The Composition of Food, 5th edition21.  Under- and over-reporting BIOBANK defines the nutritional data as not credible if the daily energy intake exceeded 20 MJ for males or 18 MJ for females. However, under-reporting was not accounted for. Therefore, under-reporting in the present study was defined as overall energy intake <1.1 × basal metabolic rate (BMR) 22, 23, with the BMR calculated by Mifflin St Jeor 24. All under- and over-reporters were excluded.  Demographic and anthropometric factors Anthropometric measures, including height, weight, body mass index and waist circumference, were also recorded by trained staff using standard operating procedures. Age, sex and ethnicity were also collected.  Socio-economic status Socio-economic status is associated with dietary intake 25. The Biobank dataset includes the Townsend Deprivation Index (TDI) 26 as a measure of deprivation, which takes into account four factors: unemployment, non-car ownership, non-home ownership and household overcrowding 26. The Index is a continuous variable, with positive numbers indicating relative material deprivation and negative numbers indicating relative affluence.  Data analysis The independent variables were created by splitting the dataset into those with a percentage of total calories of CHO <26% and those =45%, as well as those with an CHO intake of <130 g day–1 and =225 g day–1. The data for those consuming =26% and <45% (or =130 g and <225 g) were discarded. The CHO intake was only available for individuals with completed 24-h recalls, which limited the dataset to 210 465 individuals. Macro- and micronutrient intakes, fibre and total sugar were created by averaging their reported intake across each of the 24-h dietary recalls. Micronutrient intakes were calculated as percentages of age- and sex-specific Reference Nutrient Intakes (RNI) 27. Foods and groups analysed were those indicative of healthful or unhealthful dietary patterns that were used in previous research 13. Median portion sizes were calculated from the consecutive 24-h dietary recalls following recoding. For example, the BIOBANK code of 444 (quarter of a portion) was recoded to 0.25 and a BIOBANK code of 555 (half a portion) was recoded to 0.5. Where individuals reporting having 4+ or 5+ portion sizes, this was coded as 4 and 5, respectively. The BIOBANK 24-h recall dataset does not have an option for ‘zero’ or ‘none’ of a food. Therefore, where a person had completed a 24-h recall that visit but there was no response (missing data) noted for a food, the missing data were recoded as 0. Food groups (processed meats and high-sugar, high-fat puddings and snacks) were created by adding the median intake of all individual foods in that category. Total fruits and vegetables were both calculated by totalling the number of different reported fruits and vegetables consumed over the four dietary recalls, without consideration for the portion size reported. In other words, if an individual reported consuming any serving size of a fruit or vegetable (half a portion, one, two), it was counted as one piece consumed. This was used to indicate the variety of fruits and vegetables consumed, which is considered an important aspect of a healthful diet.  Statistical analysis To determine differences in normally distributed dependent variables, independent t-tests were used. The Mann–Whitney U-test was used to examine differences in intake of ordinal variables. Proportions between groups were compared using chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact test where cells did not have sufficient numbers, with a Bonferroni correction being used to account for multiple comparisons. Independent t-tests were carried out to determine whether the TDI was significant between the LCHO and NCHO diets. One-way analyses of variance were carried out to determine whether the TDI was significantly different between ordinal dietary variables and bivariate correlations were carried out to determine the relationship between the TDI and continuous dietary variables. Where significant relationships were observed between the TDI and dietary intake, the dataset was split into quartiles of the TDI and the tests described above were carried out to determine whether the differences in dietary intake observed between the LCHO and NCHO diets remained in each of the quartiles. To rule out the confounding effect of people on a NCHO diet following a vegan or vegetarian diet, the above tests were run with and without people self-reporting as vegan or vegetarian. We examined the number of 24-h dietary recalls for the LCHO and the NCHO groups, and sensitivity analyses were run including only those people with more than one 24-h dietary recall completed.

More than half of both LCHO groups consumed butter as their spread of choice compared to one-third of the NCHO groups (Table 3). People consuming a NCHO diet also reported a significantly greater amount and variety of fruits and vegetables consumed (Table 3). Of note, most people on both LCHO diets reported having consumed zero types of fruits across the 24-h dietary recalls, with a further quarter having only one portion (Table 2).

",,NA,No others,Yes,"""In this cross-sectional study, the reported intakes of key foods and food groups differed between the LCHO and NCHO groups, although both groups included foods that were both beneficial and potentially deleterious to long-term health.  Individuals in the NCHO groups reported consuming substantially more foods such as doughnuts, pastries, biscuits and chocolate compared to the LCHO groups. A potential advantage of LCHO diets includes the observation that, by reducing dietary CHO, such diets will inevitably reduce added sugars 13. Furthermore, because much of the added sugar in the UK diet comes from foods that are also high in fat, LCHO diets lead to a reduction in these energy-dense, highly palatable items, which are over-consumed across the UK population 28. The present analysis suggests this may be the case and the findings are supported by a cross-sectional study in a US population reporting that added sugars provided 4% kcal in the LCHO group (<30% kcal from CHO) versus 21% in the high CHO group (>55% kcal from CHO) 29. Reverse causality cannot be ruled out, although a previous study also found that the reduction in CHO was associated with a selective reduction in added sugars 13. The UK Biobank dataset provides total sugars from all sources (all mono- and disaccharides, including those from milk and present in the structure of foods, such as fruit and vegetables) and so it is not possible to determine the association between the CHO restriction and added sugar restriction in the present study. In any case, to determine whether a LCHO diet leads to a specific reduction in added sugars, a prospective study in people intentionally following a LCHO diet would be required.  Similar to a previous analysis 13, the present study finds that individuals in the LCHO group consume higher quantities of meat, poultry and fish compared to people on a NCHO diet. In general, these differences were small and the statistical significance is a consequence of the large sample size in the study. Poultry appeared to be the most frequently consumed source of animal protein across the whole cohort and close to half of individuals reported consuming beef, lamb and pork less than once per week. This likely reflects the fact that the BIOBANK and similar volunteer cohorts tend to engage in healthier behaviours than the wider population 30. However, only 20% of people in the LCHO group and 15% in the NCHO groups met the current recommendations for oily fish consumption. The consumption of vegetable-sources of protein was higher in the NCHO groups but, in general, they were consumed in small amounts across the cohort. Nuts, seeds and pulses are also high in micronutrients, fibre and other non-nutritive components likely beneficial for health 31-33. Therefore, most individuals in the UK BIOBANK cohort would benefit from increasing their consumption of oily fish, nuts, seeds and pulses, irrespective of whether they are consuming a NCHO or LCHO diet.  Fruit and vegetable intake were calculated by summing each different fruit and vegetable that was consumed over each of the 24-h dietary recalls and thus appeared high compared to typically reported intakes 13. Fruit was consumed much less frequently and in much less variety in the LCHO compared to the NCHO group, which might be a result of individuals on a LCHO diet attempting to avoid excessive ‘sugar’. Mono- and di-saccharides are often referred to under the umbrella of ‘sugar’ in the lay press, despite lactose, glucose and fructose having substantially different glycaemic indices 34 and distinct metabolic effects. For example, fructose consumed in excess, and in particular in liquid form, is causally related to hepatic triglyceride deposition 35, whereas fruit consumed in typical quantities lowers post-prandial glucose compared to starch and other sugars, without deleterious effects on metabolic function 36. If individuals are concerned about the glycaemic effect of whole fruits, advice could be offered on low-glycaemic varieties.  The LCHO groups had a higher percentage of people consuming zero servings of vegetables over the five dietary recalls compared to the NCHO groups. Two previous studies have indicated that people consuming a LCHO eating pattern eat more vegetables, which may be due to their largely negligible available CHO content 13, 37. The difference in the present study may be that the LCHO group in the UK BIOBANK had higher material deprivation. Vegetables, when eaten in variety, can provide a substantial amount of fibres, micronutrients and non-nutritive compounds 38. Fibre is particularly important when individuals are consuming fewer high-fibre foods such as cereals, wholegrain breads and fruits. Notwithstanding the limitation of the LCHO data originating primarily from one 24-dietary recall, it is of some concern that a large proportion of people report having zero vegetables. Individuals who aim to follow a LCHO diet should be counselled to consume sufficient vegetables, with an emphasis on the benefits for general and gastrointestinal health.  An oft-cited concern regarding LCHO diets is that they may be deficient in key nutrients 2. In the present study, only potassium and magnesium were lower than the recommended intakes for the LCHO diets. Caution must be applied to these results because 24-h dietary recalls can be unreliable for micronutrients 39. Nevertheless, potassium and magnesium are under-consumed across the population, with lower intakes in reduced-carbohydrate diets being reported previously 13, and potassium intake from 24-h dietary recalls may be comparable to dietary records 39. Increasing the consumption of fruits (low-glycaemic if necessary) and vegetables alongside, nuts, dairy products and oily fish would be a sensible, whole-diet centred recommendation for people consuming both LCHO and NCHO diets.  To our knowledge, the calorie contribution of alcohol in LCHO diets has not been discussed at length previously. Alcohol consumption in this study is significantly higher in both LCHO groups than in the NCHO groups, even when the proportion of CHO is calculated from non-alcohol kcal. If we calculate a LCHO diet from total energy intake (data not shown), alcohol contributes up to 16% of the calories consumed in the LCHO group. We note this because alcohol calories are not mentioned in documents suggesting cut-offs for LCHO diets 9 and, accordingly, future analyses in this area should take this into account. Furthermore, alcohol intake should be considered within the context of CHO restriction and practitioners should work with patients to ensure that alcohol is not replacing CHO.""",Yes,see 18,Partially,"see 18.

""",,Yes,"We offer some recommendations for further research in this area: given the very small number of people following a LCHO diet in a dataset with more than 200 000 dietary recalls available, future research may require a specific survey of people deliberately consuming a LCHO diet. This would also address the limitation of the present study in that we cannot be sure these individuals were intentionally following a LCHO diet. It would also be useful to determine the reason why people choose to follow the diet to observe whether this influences dietary choices such as the consumption of fruits.  In conclusion, the present study finds that self-reported dietary intake in LCHO dietary patterns has both favourable and potentially adverse characteristics compared to a NCHO diet.

In the Health Surveys for England (HSE) 1995, 1996, 2001 and Scottish Health Surveys (SHS) 1998 and 2003 combined, there were 500 deaths among 6579 white never-smokers aged 40–69 years at entry, followed for a mean of 13.9 years. SD (z) scores for forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were derived using Global Lung Initiative 2012 reference equations.

Outlying observations were excluded by restricting all the analyses in both data sets to values of zFEV1 and zFVC within the range -5 to +5 z-score units. This exclusion removed 0.2% of UKB participants, 0.5% of participants in the national health surveys aged 40–69 years and 0.3% of national health survey participants aged 70 years or more.""",,NA,no groupings,,NA,no groupings,,Yes,"""The relationship of spirometric indices with subsequent mortality was modelled by proportional hazards (Cox) regression, which estimates the relative increase in mortality rate (HR) for a unit change in each explanatory variable. The z-scores are expressed on a SD scale, so HRs for zFEV1 and zFVC are expressed per unit decrement (ie, an increase in risk for a decrease in lung function). A typical range of z-scores among lifelong non-smokers would be 4 units. A HR of 1.2 per unit decrement corresponds approximately to a twofold difference in mortality rate across this range.  Due to the high correlation between zFEV1 and zFVC among lifelong non-smokers (0.88 in Biobank, 0.80 in national health survey participants aged 40–69 years), we modelled the association of mortality with zFEV1 both alone and jointly with zFEVFVC, and similarly for zFVC. Among never-smokers, the correlations between zFEV1 and zFEVFVC (0.35 in Biobank, 0.36 in the national surveys) and between zFVC and zFEVFVC (-0.13 in Biobank, -0.20 in the national surveys) were weak enough to avoid major collinearity in the joint models. The significance of the HR for zFEVFVC when modelled jointly with zFEV1 was used to assess whether zFVC predicted mortality independent of zFEV1, and vice versa when zFEVFVC was modelled jointly with zFEV1.  All proportional hazards models were restricted to white participants and adjusted for sex, age, standing height, socioeconomic status and region. Analyses of data from the five national health surveys were additionally adjusted for survey year as a categorical variable. Since each survey was conducted in a different year, inclusion of survey year in the model is closely equivalent to a fixed-effect meta-analysis of the results from each of the five surveys. In a more formal two-stage individual participant meta-analysis for all-cause mortality in lifelong non-smokers, there was no substantial or significant heterogeneity of HRs among the five national health surveys (I²=0.0%, p=0.775 for zFEV1; I²=10.5%, p=0.346 for zFVC). Therefore, for simplicity of presentation we report results for the five national surveys combined, but analyse UKB separately because one of our objectives is to investigate how closely these two sets of results correspond. Heterogeneity between HRs for the pooled national surveys and UKB was assessed by testing the significance of the difference between the corresponding log-HRs from these two data sets.  The assumption of proportionality of hazards was assessed by log-log plots and by fitting zFEV1 or zFVC as a time-dependent covariate in the model. No strong or statistically significant evidence of time dependence emerged for all-cause mortality among lifelong non-smokers. Nevertheless, results for all-cause mortality were partitioned at 5 years of follow-up for two reasons. First, because the minimum duration of follow-up in UKB was 4.87 years, so virtually all of that cohort had been followed for 5 years or more, allowing a more direct comparison with results from the national health surveys, all of which had been followed for more than 5 years. The second reason for partitioning at 5 years was to address the possibility of reverse causation (impaired spirometric performance due to pre-existing conditions which lead to early death). Reverse causation was also investigated by analysing mortality in subgroups with no prior history of respiratory disease, circulatory disease or cancer.""",Partially,"""Reverse causation was also investigated by analysing mortality in subgroups with no prior history of respiratory disease, circulatory disease or cancer.""",,No,"""Online supplementary e-table 3 shows that within UKB the general pattern of results was similar in both sexes.

Therefore, while the results from the Biobank ‘best quality’ subgroup are of confirmatory interest, the more inclusive results for all ‘usable spirograms’ may be more generally relevant.  In both cohorts, age–sex–height-adjusted lung function emerged as a stronger predictor of all-cause mortality than either systolic blood pressure or body mass index, which are, respectively, the second and sixth most influential causes worldwide of loss of healthy lifespan, as measured by disability-adjusted life years.21 It is therefore puzzling to find U-shaped or J-shaped relationships of mortality with these two cardiovascular risk factors, but the similar patterns of results in Biobank and the national health surveys suggest that this is not a unique feature of either of these British cohorts.

We sought to verify this in lifelong non-smokers, among whom confounding by active smoking can be excluded, and investigate associations with circulatory and cancer deaths.  Methods In UK Biobank, among 149 343 white never-smokers aged 40–69 years at entry, 2401 deaths occurred over a mean of 6.5-year follow-up. In the Health Surveys for England (HSE) 1995, 1996, 2001 and Scottish Health Surveys (SHS) 1998 and 2003 combined, there were 500 deaths among 6579 white never-smokers aged 40–69 years at entry, followed for a mean of 13.9 years. SD (z) scores for forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were derived using Global Lung Initiative 2012 reference equations. These z-scores were related to deaths from all causes, circulatory disease and cancers using proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, height, socioeconomic status, region and survey.""",Yes,"""Results In the HSE–SHS data set, decreasing z-scores for FEV1 (zFEV1) and FVC (zFVC) were each associated to a similar degree with increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratios per unit decrement 1.17, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.25 for zFEV1 and 1.19, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.28 for zFVC). This was replicated in Biobank (HRs 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.26 and 1.24, 1.19 to 1.29, respectively). zFEV1 and zFVC were less strongly associated with mortality from circulatory diseases in HSE–SHS (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.40 for zFVC) than in Biobank (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.60 for zFVC). For cancer mortality, HRs were more consistent between cohorts (for zFVC: HRs 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.24 in HSE–SHS and 1.10, 1.05 to 1.15 in Biobank). The strongest associations were with respiratory mortality (for zFVC: HRs 1.61, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.08 in HSE–SHS and 2.15, 1.77 to 2.61 in Biobank).

Modelling of mortality The relationship of spirometric indices with subsequent mortality was modelled by proportional hazards (Cox) regression, which estimates the relative increase in mortality rate (HR) for a unit change in each explanatory variable. The z-scores are expressed on a SD scale, so HRs for zFEV1 and zFVC are expressed per unit decrement (ie, an increase in risk for a decrease in lung function). A typical range of z-scores among lifelong non-smokers would be 4 units. A HR of 1.2 per unit decrement corresponds approximately to a twofold difference in mortality rate across this range.  Due to the high correlation between zFEV1 and zFVC among lifelong non-smokers (0.88 in Biobank, 0.80 in national health survey participants aged 40–69 years), we modelled the association of mortality with zFEV1 both alone and jointly with zFEVFVC, and similarly for zFVC.

All proportional hazards models were restricted to white participants and adjusted for sex, age, standing height, socioeconomic status and region. Analyses of data from the five national health surveys were additionally adjusted for survey year as a categorical variable. Since each survey was conducted in a different year, inclusion of survey year in the model is closely equivalent to a fixed-effect meta-analysis of the results from each of the five surveys. In a more formal two-stage individual participant meta-analysis for all-cause mortality in lifelong non-smokers, there was no substantial or significant heterogeneity of HRs among the five national health surveys (I²=0.0%, p=0.775 for zFEV1; I²=10.5%, p=0.346 for zFVC).

First, because the minimum duration of follow-up in UKB was 4.87 years, so virtually all of that cohort had been followed for 5 years or more, allowing a more direct comparison with results from the national health surveys, all of which had been followed for more than 5 years. The second reason for partitioning at 5 years was to address the possibility of reverse causation (impaired spirometric performance due to pre-existing conditions which lead to early death). Reverse causation was also investigated by analysing mortality in subgroups with no prior history of respiratory disease, circulatory disease or cancer.""",NA,Not used,,Yes,"Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, e-Table 3,  e-Table 4, e-Table 6, e-Table 7, Figure 1",,Partially,"Do not give full test statistics ""Comparisons by subgroups of age and sex Online supplementary e-table 3 shows that within UKB the general pattern of results was similar in both sexes. There was no statistically significant effect modification by sex for either spirometric index in any smoking subgroup (p>0.10 for each interaction test).  Online supplementary e-table 3 also compares the results for all-cause mortality among younger (aged 40–59 years) and older (aged 60–69 years) UKB participants. The HRs in all smoking groups were consistent between these two age subgroups and there were no statistically significant age interactions for either spirometric index (p>0.40).""",NA,Not used,,NA,Not used,Yes,"""Principal findings A broadly coherent picture emerges from this comparison of UK national cohorts. Ventilatory function, even if measured imperfectly, consistently predicted both respiratory deaths and non-respiratory mortality from a range of causes. This was found even among lifelong non-smokers, so confounding by the amount or duration of active smoking is not the sole explanation. Both for all-cause mortality and more specifically for circulatory disease mortality, FEV1 and FVC were as strongly predictive as body mass index and more strongly predictive than systolic blood pressure.""",Partially,"""Strengths and weaknesses of this study UKB offers a spirometric study of lifelong non-smokers of unprecedented size, but its 5.5% participation rate may have compromised its generalisability. Assembling data from five UK national health surveys produced a cohort of never-smokers, larger than the combined number of participants in previous publications3,4 in which the generalisability of Biobank results could be tested. The similar pattern of results in HSE–SHS and UKB suggests that the key findings are generalisable, at least to the British population.  Within Biobank, the large numbers permitted subgroup analyses by sex, age, obesity and pre-existing disease, of sufficient statistical power to exclude important interaction effects. These within-cohort comparisons provide further reassurance about the generalisability of the principal findings among lifelong non-smokers.  Although only 58% of the Biobank cohort performed spirometry which fulfilled internationally recommended criteria for acceptability and reproducibility,17 the results in this subgroup were very similar to those among the full set of Biobank participants who performed ‘usable’ spirometry. Those results were, in turn, consistent with the findings from national health surveys where the acceptability and reproducibility of spirometry was not formally assessed in the field. These within-cohort and cross-cohort comparisons suggest that the principal findings are robust to inclusion or exclusion of participants with suboptimal spirometric performance.  In common with previous studies of this topic, our analysis was restricted to fatal outcomes and therefore cannot distinguish between an influence of reduced ventilatory function on disease incidence and an effect on case fatality. The association with cancer mortality was weaker among those with no cancer diagnosis at entry, suggesting an association primarily with case fatality. In contrast, the association of spirometric indices with circulatory mortality was equally strong in those with and without a prior history of circulatory disease. The recent linkage of hospital admissions and primary care consultations to the UKB cohort will allow associations with incidence and case fatality to be investigated more directly in future.""",Partially,"Do not discuss magnitude nor reverse causality which they tested for ""Strengths and weaknesses of this study UKB offers a spirometric study of lifelong non-smokers of unprecedented size, but its 5.5% participation rate may have compromised its generalisability.

Therefore, while the results from the Biobank ‘best quality’ subgroup are of confirmatory interest, the more inclusive results for all ‘usable spirograms’ may be more generally relevant.  In both cohorts, age–sex–height-adjusted lung function emerged as a stronger predictor of all-cause mortality than either systolic blood pressure or body mass index, which are, respectively, the second and sixth most influential causes worldwide of loss of healthy lifespan, as measured by disability-adjusted life years.21 It is therefore puzzling to find U-shaped or J-shaped relationships of mortality with these two cardiovascular risk factors, but the similar patterns of results in Biobank and the national health surveys suggest that this is not a unique feature of either of these British cohorts.
