Whereas this may potentially protect against early mortality, it may have negative sequelae in later life, including susceptibility to some chronic diseases. 7  Low birth weight and MDD A recent meta-analysis which pooled assessments of the association between low birth weight and risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) derived in 18 separate studies, comprising a total of 59 442 participants, did not find evidence for an association once publication bias was taken into account. 2 The authors noted significant heterogeneity between studies, including wide age ranges of participants, different outcome measures, inadequate follow-up rates and low power. Studies also often failed to control for important potential confounders such as maternal smoking or maternal MDD, socioeconomic status, gestational age, gender and family history of MDD, and some studies included extremely low birth weight (<1000 g) participants from specialist hospital environments.

We were also able to assess the associations between birth weight and neuroticism scores, and risk of BD in adulthood. Neuroticism is recognised as a risk factor for MDD and for psychopathology in general, 8 with individuals who score highly on neuroticism characterised as having a tendency to be less emotionally stable, more anxious and more reactive to negative events. 9""",,Yes,"""The objectives of this study were: to test for an association between birth weight category and each outcome; to determine whether there was evidence of a dose-effect across very low (<1500 g), low (1500–2490 g) and normal (≥2500 g) birth weight; to determine whether any associations persisted after adjustment for potential confounding variables; and to explore whether physical health and neuroticism had possible mediating roles in the associations with MDD and BD, using formal tests of mediation for the latter. 11,12""",,Yes,"""UK Biobank recruited 502 649 participants aged around 40–70 years from the general population between 2006 and 2010...All participants attended 1 of 22 assessment centres""",,No,,yes,Yes,"""UK Biobank recruited 502 649 participants aged around 40–70 years from the general population between 2006 and 2010.

Neuroticism scores were positively skewed, and log/square root transformations did not improve the distribution; we report linear regression statistics because the final results were not meaningfully different from Spearman non-parametric correlations (not shown) but are easier to interpret, and assumptions of normality are to an extent eased in very large data-sets. 19 Because the MDD and BD groups had significantly higher neuroticism scores, as would be expected (both P<0.001), we removed participants with either of these disorders from the neuroticism analyses.  We used Poisson regression to estimate relative risk (RR) ratios for the MDD and BD analyses in relation to birth weight. RR ratios are preferable to odds ratios when the outcome is not rare (i.e. >10%) in the population, as odds ratios are poor estimates of RRs in such circumstances, and are harder to interpret. 20 P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS V.22, except for Fig. 1 which was made by using STATA SE v.13.  We found a positive association between year of birth and birth weight in kilograms, controlling for maternal smoking and maternal depression (r=0.01, P<0.001) suggesting a possible birth cohort effect. We tested each association unadjusted for covariates, and then adjusted for possible confounding variables: year of birth (i.e. controlling for possible age and birth cohort effects), Townsend deprivation score, White v. Black and minority ethnic, gender, maternal smoking and maternal depression. Finally, because physical disorders can be risk factors for psychiatric disorders 21 and are, therefore, potential mediators, for the MDD and BD analyses we added the covariates of hypertension, cardiac disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, type 2 diabetes, COPD and osteoporosis. For each model, we first tested for an overall deleterious very low>low>normal birth weight dose effect, and then for an effect of birth weight group (very low/low) v. normal weight as the referent category.  We formally tested whether significant birth weight and mood disorder associations were mediated by trait neuroticism scores, using the PROCESS macro. 12 Briefly, the effect of a predictor variable (e.g. birth weight group) on an outcome variable (e.g. MDD) can be either direct or indirect via a mediator (e.g. neuroticism). In a mediation context, a three-way association has two products: ‘Path A’: the association between the predictor and mediator (e.g. birth weight and neuroticism), and ‘Path B’: the mediator and outcome association adjusted for the predictor (e.g. association for neuroticism and MDD adjusted for birth weight). The indirect effect is the combined product of these two paths. 11,12 We used the PROCESS macro ‘Model 4’, which allows for dichotomous independent variables/outcomes in mediation models (bootstrap n=1000, bias-corrected).  We excluded all participants who had requested withdrawal from the UK Biobank as of March 2015.

Tests of mediation showed that the association between birth weight and MDD was partially mediated by its association with neuroticism.  We found a significant association between low birth weight and higher neuroticism, which survived adjustment for relevant covariates. There was a significant dose effect, such that lower birth weight was associated with higher neuroticism in adulthood (i.e. very low>low>normal). The birth weight/neuroticism associations were characterised by relatively small effect sizes: around a 0.20–0.30 increase in neuroticism scores (out of 12) for low/very low v. normal birth weight. Given the large sample size, statistical significance may not be clinically meaningful, in terms of being a risk factor for MDD/BD.  We found a significant association between low/very low birth weight and increased risk of MDD. This survived adjustment for potential confounding variables and physical disorder history. There appeared to be dose effect, with lower birth weight being associated with higher MDD rates. We found a similar dose effect association for BD. When we separately contrasted very low and low birth weight categories with normal birth weight, we found a significant association between very low birth weight and risk of BD in the unadjusted and confounder- but not mediator-adjusted model (i.e. additionally corrected for physical disorders).

Whereas this may potentially protect against early mortality, it may have negative sequelae in later life, including susceptibility to some chronic diseases.7  Low birth weight and MDD A recent meta-analysis which pooled assessments of the association between low birth weight and risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) derived in 18 separate studies, comprising a total of 59 442 participants, did not find evidence for an association once publication bias was taken into account.2 The authors noted significant heterogeneity between studies, including wide age ranges of participants, different outcome measures, inadequate follow-up rates and low power. Studies also often failed to control for important potential confounders such as maternal smoking or maternal MDD, socioeconomic status, gestational age, gender and family history of MDD, and some studies included extremely low birth weight (<1000 g) participants from specialist hospital environments.2 We aimed to add to the literature in this area by testing for an association between low/very low birth weight and risk of MDD (in adulthood) using the data collected at recruitment of a large population cohort (UK Biobank). We were also able to assess the associations between birth weight and neuroticism scores, and risk of BD in adulthood.

Design:  Cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank were used to compare 1,327 self-reported Ménière’s cases with 479,500 controls. The authors used logistic regression models to investigate the relation of Ménière’s disease with the components of adult height. Models were adjusted for a range of potential confounders including age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and socioeconomic status. Results:  In the UK Biobank, Ménière’s was inversely associated with overall stature (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation increase in height, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80–0.94) and leg length (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.94) in fully adjusted models. No association was noted in adjusted models with trunk length (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88–1.01). Conclusions:  The specific association between leg length, a potential marker of adverse childhood environments, and Ménière’s may suggest that early-life environmental exposures that influence skeletal growth may also influence the risk of developing Ménière’s in later life. Adverse early life exposures are known to contribute to the development of a number of complex diseases in adulthood (e.g., diabetes, heart disease) and may also impact on self-reported Ménière’s disease. The components of height are well-established proxies for adverse childhood environments. We utilized height measures in the UK Biobank to investigate the influence of early life factors on self-reported Ménière’s disease for the first time. The findings indicated that height and leg length were inversely associated with self-report of Ménière’s disease. This finding suggests early life environmental exposures that influence skeletal growth may also influence risk of developing Ménière’s disease in later life.  INTRODUCTION Ménière’s disease, a disorder of the inner ear, defined by episodes of vertigo, aural fullness, tinnitus, and sensorineural hearing loss, afflicts hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide (Sajjadi & Paparella 2008). Currently, our understanding of the disease etiology remains obscure. It is a complex multifactorial disease with a range of risk factors implicated including family history (genetic and/or childhood environment) (Gazquez & Lopez-Escamez 2011), viral infection (Williams et al. 1987), allergy (Derebery & Berliner 2010), autoimmunity (Gazquez et al. 2011), and nervous system dysfunction (e.g., migraine; Peroutka 2004) all identified as potential contributory factors (Tyrrell et al. 2014a).  Concomitant diseases and other risk factors such as family history, viral infection, and allergy suggest that early-life exposures may contribute to an individual’s risk of developing Ménière’s. However, to date, very limited information is available on the role of early-life exposure in developing Ménière’s. Furthermore, the Barker Hypothesis may also play a role in disease etiology (Hales et al. 1991). A key proxy for differing exposures in intrauterine, perinatal, and early childhood is adult anthropometric measures, especially leg length. Poor maternal and childhood health, insufficient diet (energy intake was positively associated with leg length; beta 0.0027 [0.0013–0.0041]) (Wadsworth et al. 2002), adverse family circumstances (e.g., socioeconomic status [SES] and overcrowding in early childhood both reduce adult leg length by approximately 10–15 cm; Li et al. 2007), and maternal smoking during pregnancy are each known to reduce leg length, independent of birth weight (Gunnell et al. 1998; Wadsworth et al. 2002; Gunnell et al. 2003; Li et al. 2007).  Numerous studies have demonstrated that taller adults have lower risks of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity (Whitley et al. 2012). Furthermore, studies have indicated that leg length is the main contributor to this association (Gunnell et al. 2003), with trunk length associations, weaker or absent. The mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. The prepubertal linear growth occurs more in the leg than in the trunk (Whitley et al. 2012), and leg length may be a particularly sensitive marker of adverse prepubertal environmental factors that affect growth. Studies have also demonstrated that leg length was sensitive to infant (younger than 5 years) socioeconomic circumstance and diet (Wadsworth et al. 2002). Leg length in childhood is robustly correlated with leg length in adulthood. Shorter leg length has been associated with a number of adulthood diseases including coronary heart disease (CHD) (Lawlor et al. 2004) and type 2 diabetes (Lawlor et al. 2002).  The role of early-life exposures in the subsequent development of Ménière’s has not been investigated to date, and this may be due to the lack of large cohorts with available data on both Ménière’s and anthropometric measures.""",,Yes,"""The role of early-life exposures in the subsequent development of Ménière’s has not been investigated to date, and this may be due to the lack of large cohorts with available data on both Ménière’s and anthropometric measures.

Data Analysis Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations of components of height with Ménière’s. Crude and adjusted models were constructed in which prevalent Ménière’s was the outcome (dependent variable) and components of height (total height, leg length, trunk length, and leg-to-trunk ratio), entered as continuous standard deviation–scaled variables or as quintiles, were the main explanatory variables. The models were concerned with assessing the effect of potential confounding factors on the associations. We adjusted for age, sex, smoking status (never, past, or current), body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, social class (as determined by education), diabetes, and CHD. We adjusted for diabetes and CHD as these have previously been associated with adult height.

""Ménière’s Diagnosis During a nurse-led interview, all participants in the UK Biobank were asked what doctor-diagnosed health conditions they experienced from. The nurse then recorded the disease(s) reported in a predetermined list. If the participant was uncertain about an illness, the condition was described to the interviewer who attempted to place it within the list, with the help of a doctor if necessary. There were several options for ear/vestibular disorders: tinnitus, vertigo, labyrinthitis, Ménière’s disease, otosclerosis, or a generic ear/vestibular disorder. We selected all individuals who had reported having Ménière’s (n = 1376). While self-reported, we anticipate that our Ménière’s variable is valid as these individuals reported current tinnitus and hearing loss (Tyrrell et al. 2014a). Furthermore, the majority participants who recorded Meniere’s disease also recorded a prescription of betahistine and vestibular sedatives at the time of the UK Biobank baseline questionnaire, reflecting the current UK prescribing practice for Ménière’s and they also reported avoiding salt, caffeine, and alcohol, which is common clinical advice for individuals with Ménière’s (Tyrrell et al. 2014a).

This finding is consistent, when tested in all cases and controls, in cases versus age- and sex-matched controls and in a subgroup analysis of women only.

The disease diagnosis was self-reported; however, people were also able to select vestibular disorder, tinnitus, vertigo, and labyrinthitis which, along with the presence and advice of a trained nurse, should have reduced the number of people incorrectly reporting Ménière’s. Furthermore, the self-reported Ménière’s sufferers had increased odds of Ménière’s-type symptoms and reporting the use of Ménière’s medication and commonly used dietary self-management. It is possible that the people reporting Ménière’s in the UK Biobank are incorrectly diagnosed. Ménière’s is particularly difficult to diagnose in the early stages of the disease. We performed a sensitivity analysis where we excluded individuals diagnosed in the 5 years before recruitment to the UK Biobank, as it is anticipated that in this time frame, newly diagnosed individuals will undergo a range of tests that might suggest misdiagnosis (Sajjadi & Paparella 2008).  There may be participants in the UK Biobank who have Meniere’s disease but are not yet diagnosed, but as the prevalence was 0.27% which is similar to prior studies, we believe this number to be small. The recruitment strategy of the UK Biobank meant that it is not a representative sample of the British population (borne out by the under-representation of ethnic minorities), and selection criteria also limit it to the 40- to 70-year-old age range. Volunteer bias may have occurred, with more people with health conditions volunteering than healthy individuals. Healthy participant bias may also operate in the opposing direction with relatively fit people participating, as some travel to recruitment centers were involved (with a large proportion of participants past the retirement age participating). Finally, we used the cross-sectional baseline data of the UK Biobank; however, as we are investigating associations between Ménière’s and height, we can assume that factors contributing to height occurred before the diagnosis of Ménière’s in most individuals.  Other unmeasured factors not considered in the analyses may underlie the associations; for example, growth-regulating genes may be independently associated with Ménière’s. Genetics currently explain approximately 12% of the variation in adult height although it is anticipated that more variants will be identified in the future. We were unable to investigate the role of genetics within this study; future work should consider the associations while accounting for known height variants. Alternatively, taller individuals are considered to be more successful in later life (Case & Paxson 2006), and this may protect against Ménière’s rather than some growth-influencing exposure. Our previous work suggested an inverse association between educational attainment and Ménière’s (Tyrrell et al. 2014a).  We were also unable to account for changes in height due to aging.

These studies demonstrated that adult height and particularly leg length were inversely associated with disease prevalence in adulthood. A recent study demonstrated an association between leg length and metabolic disorders underlying type 2 diabetes, including lower insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function (Johnston et al. 2013). Previous studies into Ménière’s have suggested an association between the disease and insulin resistance (Lavinsky et al. 2013)...This study demonstrated robust associations between Ménière’s and the components of adult height, with consistent associations with leg length after adjusting for various confounders. The specific association between leg length and Ménière’s may suggest that early-life environmental exposures that influence skeletal growth also influence Ménière’s risk in later life. This is feasible as factors that influence skeletal growth are likely to impact on the development of the nervous and immune systems, both of which are implicated in Ménière’s etiology (Tyrrell et al. 2014a).

The mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. The prepubertal linear growth occurs more in the leg than in the trunk (Whitley et al. 2012), and leg length may be a particularly sensitive marker of adverse prepubertal environmental factors that affect growth. Studies have also demonstrated that leg length was sensitive to infant (younger than 5 years) socioeconomic circumstance and diet (Wadsworth et al. 2002).

This is feasible as factors that influence skeletal growth are likely to impact on the development of the nervous and immune systems, both of which are implicated in Ménière’s etiology (Tyrrell et al. 2014a). This finding may not be clinically relevant for the treatment of Ménière’s, but our analyses support the importance of the childhood environment (e.g., good nutrition, low burden of disease) in the growth and development of a healthy neurosensory system.""",Yes,"""The recruitment strategy of the UK Biobank meant that it is not a representative sample of the British population (borne out by the under-representation of ethnic minorities), and selection criteria also limit it to the 40- to 70-year-old age range.

vonSc2018hort4458,"Associations between chronotype, morbidity and mortality in the UK Biobank cohort",KD,Cohort,No,,no,No,"""Introduction Identifying novel,potentially modifiable, life-style factors associated with increased morbidity and mortality can lead to innovative strategies for improving health. We investigated a measure of chronotype, which is an estimate of the general part of the day (ranging between morning and evening) that a person prefers for their daily activities. Later chronotype (i.e. evening preference) and later timing of sleep (which is associated with later chronotype) have been associated with morbidity, including higher rates of metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Reutrakul and Knutson 2015; Merikanto et al. 2013; Yu et al. 2015; Koopman et al. 2017) and psychiatric symptoms (Jankowski 2016; Melo et al. 2017; Putilov 2017). In the UK Biobank Study, a large prospective cohort study, a preference for evening was also associated with more cardiovascular risk factors, such as higher rates of smoking and overweight/obesity (Patterson et al. 2017).  Current evidence therefore implicates later chronotype (i.e. being a self-described “evening person”) in the risk of a variety of diseases. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that a later chronotype is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality as well as mortality due to CVD in a large study of adults in the United Kingdom.""",yes,No,,partial,Yes,"""The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that a later chronotype is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality as well as mortality due to CVD in a large study of adults in the United Kingdom.""",,Yes,"""We used data from the UK Biobank, a large, prospective, population-based cohort study that was designed to investigate risk factors for major disease of middle and older age (Sudlow et al. 2015).

Our data do not reveal to what extent the association between eveningness and higher morbidity and mortality reflects genetic and environmental components. However, key environmental determinants of chronotype are potentially modifiable by interventions aimed at advancing circadian phase, such as administration of light in the morning and of melatonin in the evening. Another strategy to improve health of evening types would be to adjust work schedules to suit individual chronotype. It is also worth noting that daylight savings time (DST)/summer time places a further burden on individuals who are already struggling with the dictates of social norms on when to start the working day, and the switch to DST, which is perceived as more uncomfortable by evening types than by morning types (Nascimento De Alencar et al. 2017; Kantermann et al. 2007), also coincided with greater incidence of cardiovascular events (Jiddou et al. 2013).

This question is very similar to the last question of the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) (Horne and Ostberg, 1976), which asks, “One hears about ‘morning’ and ‘evening’ types of people. Which ONE of these types do you consider yourself to be?” and had the response options “Definitely a ‘morning’ type, Rather more a ‘morning’ than an ‘evening’ type, Rather more an ‘evening’ type than a ‘morning’ type, Definitely an ‘evening’ type”.  Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mortality information was obtained from the National Health Service for England and Wales and by the NHS Central Register in Scotland. All details from the death certificate were provided to UK Biobank. Primary cause of death was codified according to ICD10 by trained UK Biobank personnel. We identified the ICD10 codes I00-I99 as CVD-related.  Comorbidities were based on self-report. Specifically, participants were asked to report any illnesses they had and if the participant was uncertain of the type of illness he/she had, they described it to the interviewer (a trained nurse) who attempted to code it. If the illness could not be coded during the interview, the interviewer entered a free-text description, which was subsequently reviewed by a physician and, where possible, matched to codes. Using these codes, cases of self-reported cardiovascular disease, diabetes, other endocrine disorders, neurological disorders, renal disorders respiratory disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, gastrointestinal/abdominal disorders and psychological disorders were identified (see Supplemental Table 1).

A significant number of participants (50,061) selected the answer “Do not know”, however, as shown in Supplemental Table 3, including them did not appreciably change our findings. Circadian biologists mainly use two validated instruments used to assess either circadian preference, the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) (Horne and Ostberg, 1976), or circadian timing of behaviour, the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (Roenneberg et al., 2003). Both instruments require several questions to estimate circadian preference or chronotype, while the UK Biobank participants rated their chronotype through the answer to a single question. However, this question is practically identical to the final question of the MEQ, which has been found to have the highest correlation (ρ=.89) to the total MEQ score (Adan and Almirall, 1991), which suggests that misclassification may have been minimal. Further, the brevity of the question makes it more acceptable for use in clinic or public health settings. Second, the comparison of chronotype and prevalent disease does not indicate causal direction.
